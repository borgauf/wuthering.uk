<p>
The purpose of this media effort will be to convey some of my thoughts
and impressions about things <i>dark</i>, or as I cal it, the <i>Dark
Muse</i><label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.1002742' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.1002742' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
<b>muse</b>: originally any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts, <i>or</i> a
state of deep thought or abstraction, <i>or</i> a source of
inspiration
</span>. This would hopefully include, be a superset of what is
known today as goth<label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.6792394' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.6792394' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
The modern &ldquo;goth subculture&rdquo; as perhaps described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture">here</a>. It&rsquo;s as good
as any&#x2026; Lots more about goth and Dark Muse later.
</span> and gothic &#x2026; meaning I hope to go deeper
and more elemental than most modern takes on dark. And so I ask, Do
you have an inexplicable affinity for things a tad gloomy? Do you find
dreamy what they find dreary &#x2026; like when a cloudy day brings out a
strangely sanguine melancholy &#x2026; or a stormy night is frightening in
a wonderfully thrilling sort of way? Does twilight heighten your
senses <i>and</i> calm your nerves?  Perhaps you&rsquo;ve paused to gaze out upon
an old, overgrown cemetery, or a lonely, nondescript countryside
scene? And of course you&rsquo;re quickly maxed-out on happy-clappy,
sunny-cheery. You prefer candlelight over artificial light, old
architecture over new. And wouldn&rsquo;t it be great if every month (or
every week!) celebrated Halloween? If yes to any of this, I&rsquo;m
speaking to you.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s start with an example, a litmus test of sorts. I present here a
poem from my main darkness benefactress, the poet who stands at the
centre of everything I mean to say about dark&#x2014;one Emily Jane
Brontë! <label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.80700' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.80700' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
Oddly enough, I&rsquo;ve never read her <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and do
not intend to. However, her poetry I read continually, gleaning new
insights each time. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB">here</a> for a quick biography.
<br>

</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br>
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br>
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br>
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br>
I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br>
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Just a bit direct, blunt even. But there it is: You either get it or
you don&rsquo;t. Either she is speaking to something in you&#x2014;or you&rsquo;re
immediately put off, finding it, yeah, well, <i>weird</i>, overwrought,
melodramatic, puerile, morbid, or even sick or evil.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m confronted daily with people who consider my penchant for dark
things morose, morbid, indicative of an unstable, labile mind, that is
to say, something needs, suppressing, fixing. I must repudiate and
stand my ground though, mainly because I hearken back to a time when
everyone was a bit dark, namely the early nineteenth century when key
poets (e.g. the Brontës) showed us how dark goes to the core of life.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s try another poem. Here is Longfellow&rsquo;s <i>Snow-flakes</i> from a
collection published in 1863
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Out of the bosom of the Air,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,<br>
Over the woodlands brown and bare,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Over the harvest-fields forsaken,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Silent, and soft, and slow<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Descends the snow.<br>
<br>
Even as our cloudy fancies take<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Suddenly shape in some divine expression,<br>
Even as the troubled heart doth make<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In the white countenance confession,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The troubled sky reveals<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The grief it feels.<br>
<br>
This is the poem of the air,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Slowly in silent syllables recorded;<br>
This is the secret of despair,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Now whispered and revealed<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;To wood and field.<br>

</span>&#x2014;despair, grief, misery&#x2014;into more equanimous
states of sadness and melancholy by reaching out into the natural
world and <i>poetising</i><label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.3524296' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.3524296' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
The idea of poetising, the <i>poetisation</i> of nature and life was
central to the Romantic Movement. It parallels the long-standing
belief that we humans explain ourselves through, embed our lives in
narratives.
</span>. This looking to nature and poetising is
the modus operandi of the nineteenth-century poet. As if they
understood sadness to be a ravaging cancer or virus that may
eventually go into remission but can never be entirely eliminated
while on Earth. I contend we have lost the ability to process
depression into a stasis melancholy, to find a modus vivendi<label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.4931141' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.4931141' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
<b>modus vivendi</b>: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, <i>or</i> (literally) a way of living.
</span>
with the trials and tribulations of life. No, the human can never
<i>learn</i> to suffer; we suffer poorly because the viruses of tragedy can
never go away, only into remission. But I would say the Romantic Era
poets had a better grasp of life. First and foremost, they faced and
accepted doom. They took what life gave them and used it to
grow&#x2014;emotionally, spiritually.
</p>

<p>
Here is another great example of &ldquo;you get the Dark Muse or you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
this time from Emily Elizabeth Dickinson<label id='fnr.8' for='fnr-in.8.8901701' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.8.8901701' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup>

<br>
</span>, her <i>There&rsquo;s a certain
slant of light</i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There&rsquo;s a certain Slant of light, <br>

That oppresses, like the Heft <label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.8084323' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.8084323' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>

</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed. That last line includes <i>Death</i>, capitalised<label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.4516742' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.4516742' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
Dickinson often employed the German practice of capitalising
nouns for poetic emphasis.
</span>. It is my
contention that these nineteenth-century creators understood death
much differently than we do today. And since this capitalised,
other-century view of Death has become so opaque, please indulge me in
my explanation of how I think they understood it.
</p>

<h3 id="org7ed7b7a">Nature and Death in the nineteenth century</h3>

<i>The main points being:</i>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; of nature, rather, nature is ubiquitous</li>
<li>Nature not a place, rather, nature is universal</li>
<li>Nature as birth, growth, deterioration, and death</li>

</ul>

<p>
I hold that our understanding of nature today is very different than
that of early-nineteenth-century poets such as the Haworth and Amherst
Emilies <label id='fnr.11' for='fnr-in.11.7625401' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.11.7625401' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup>
My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson are based on
their towns of origin &#x2014; Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.
</span> and their contemporaries. And as a consequence, we
understand life and death much differently.
</p>

<p>
Just considering our indoor living environments today, a typical
modern building is more like a sealed spaceship landed on a hostile
alien planet compared to the simpler, more primitive indoor
environments of the not-so-distant past. Literally, the Brontës&rsquo;
Haworth parsonage, built in 1778 out of local stone and wood and clay,
had more in common with human shelters from a thousand years previous
than with our modern suburban homes only two hundred years later. And
thus&#x2014;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In just the past two to three hundred years a very steep, vertical
gradient has grown between indoors and outdoors.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And this in turn has brought us to see nature as a <i>place</i> outside of
our artificial, high-tech, controlled and regulated modern indoor
spaces &#x2026;. which, in turn, has lead us to rate the outdoors on
continua of relative wildness and remoteness from our sealed-off,
self-contained, humans-only environments.
</p>

<p>
Of course humans have always made a distinction between being inside
and outside of a shelter. Of course we came out of the so-called
<i>elements</i> into a dwelling. As do many other animal species. But once
we gave up nomadic life to live in permanent city-states starting some
six thousand years ago, we began spending more and more time in the
<i>Great Indoors</i>. And these indoor environments embedded in
ever-expanding urban centres have become increasingly self-contained,
self-referencing, recursively derivative<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.679531' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.679531' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., what is a garden but a derivative, a mock-up of an
original place out in the wilds, albeit controlled and the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits weeded out?
</span>, and, above all,
physically removed, walled off from the natural world. We now create
and follow narratives wholly <i>extra-nature</i>.
</p>

<p>
Architecture in the West seemed to reach a fantastical aesthetic
crescendo in the Victorian nineteenth century<label id='fnr.13' for='fnr-in.13.4893416' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.13.4893416' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup>
&#x2026;with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as a leading
style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
&ldquo;revivalist-nostalgic&rdquo; (Greek, Gothic, Italianate, Elizabethan, Queen
Anne, etc.), perhaps a hearkening back to times more integrated with
nature, with shallower gradients between indoors and outdoors?
</span>, coinciding with
an exponential growth in urban population. Today the steepness of our
indoor-outdoor gradient has increased even more since Western
Victorian times. Today we are more <i>extra-natural</i> than ever. How then
can we objectively measure our separation from nature? How can we
count how many rabbit hole bifurcations we&rsquo;ve taken down, out, and
away from <i>nature pure</i>? We may see this dominion over, abstraction
away, separation from nature as our fate, our destiny. And we have
somehow adapted to this separation&#x2014;our population doubling in less
than fifty years to eight billion is one measure of
dominating-prevailing. But have not some of us in recent times become
acutely aware of, if not concerned over this estrangement?<label id='fnr.14' for='fnr-in.14.2995289' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.14.2995289' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup>
Is our slow and gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling frog</a> metaphor?
</span> I
certainly have.
</p>

<p>
What if we look at nature as less a place inside or outside of our
human spaces, rather, as <i>everything going on everywhere</i>?
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<b>I say nature was once seen as the myriad cycles of birth, growth,
deterioration, and death going on everywhere&#x2014;with no mind for
location inside or outside.</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, sensed
this pre-modern meaning of nature as <i>sans localisation</i> inside or
outside. Yes, one went outside, out into the elements. But once back
indoors, the human was not so completely out of and above nature&rsquo;s
touch, influence, <i>doom</i> as we now fancy ourselves. Again, the cycles
of birth, growth, deterioration, and death were happening everywhere
<i>sans emplacement</i> <label id='fnr.15' for='fnr-in.15.5833355' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.15.5833355' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup>
Obviously the Industrial Revolution created urban production
landscapes vast and barren and completely outside of any sort of
nature, spatial or otherwise. Indeed, William Blake&rsquo;s &ldquo;satanic mills.&rdquo;
This was a huge step away from the physical world being solely the
purveyance of nature.
</span>. Here again is Emily Brontë, her <i>The night
is darkening round me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The night is darkening round me,<br>
The wild winds coldly blow;<br>
But a tyrant spell has bound me,<br>
And I cannot, cannot go.<br>
<br>
The giant trees are bending<br>
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;<br>
The storm is fast descending,<br>
And yet I cannot go.<br>
<br>
Clouds beyond clouds above me,<br>
Wastes beyond wastes below;<br>
But nothing drear can move me;<br>
I will not, cannot go.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
She refers to the wilds as &ldquo;wastes&rdquo; and as drear, and yet she is
transfixed, frozen to the spot, and she cannot, cannot go. Subjective
terms like wastes and drear remind of the age-old attitude of nature
as a sponsor of disaster and death, something to get away from, hardly
over which to wax poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that, and to
be sure, sublimely. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared
directly into an enemy previously terrible unforgiving, and in so
doing she found sublimity<label id='fnr.16' for='fnr-in.16.9142025' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.16.9142025' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup>
More on Edmund Burke&rsquo;s (as well as Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s) false,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t get it&rdquo; tedium on sublimity later. In short, <i>sublime</i> is what
we may find beyond mere beauty, touching what Dostoevsky is saying
here: <i>There are seconds, they only come five or six at a time, and
you suddenly feel the <b>presence of eternal harmony</b>, fully
achieved. It is nothing earthly; not that it is heavenly, but man
cannot endure it in his earthly state. One must change physically or
die. The feeling is clear and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense
the whole of nature and suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not
tenderheartedness, but simply joy.</i> Again, much more later&#x2026;
</span> and brought to us a new way of being
human.
</p>

<p>
With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around, the last two components, deterioration and
death, must be seen beyond our mechanistic modern take of just
terminal, physical breakage and malfunction<label id='fnr.17' for='fnr-in.17.7966261' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.17.7966261' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup>
&#x2026;as when a car is written off as &ldquo;totalled.&rdquo;
</span>. Especially death
become Death, a quasi-spiritual <i>force majeure</i>. But today
deterioration and death aren&rsquo;t what they used to be. It&rsquo;s almost as if
they were cordoned off&#x2014;at least under much greater human control
than ever before. It&rsquo;s as if through modern medicine we have begun to
acquire demi-godlike veto power over physical demise. And with this
control we have torn down, dismantled a great component of
spirituality.
</p>

<p>
Death remains an undeniable certainty. Death comes as it always has
from old age, fatal accident, or from deadly physical aggression or
predation<label id='fnr.18' for='fnr-in.18.6126008' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.18.6126008' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup>
For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are&#x2014;outside of war and homicidal criminal activity&#x2014;all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.
</span>. But a completely different attitude arises when
modern healthcare&rsquo;s labyrinth of diagnoses, drugs, procedures and
surgeries routinely thwart what was once all but unstoppable. And so
we&rsquo;ve begun to demystify Death, overturn fate and doom.
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<br>
&#x2014; Psalm 90:10<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalist
absolutism, inevitability so resounding as to shake and echo through
life. Death is life&rsquo;s backstop. Death forms the walls of life&rsquo;s
sandbox. But what if we begin to take command of these walls? Psalm
90:10 is making the point that by no means are we guaranteed seventy
or eighty years of life, and even if we get them they might not be
that great. And yet we have grown to expect a quality, vibrant
seventy, eighty, ninety, or even more years, as something due us by
modern medical science.
</p>

<p>
Let me relate a modern story to our new attitude towards death. My
father, who has since passed away, lost his <i>third</i> wife to lung
cancer caused inevitably by decades of smoking<label id='fnr.19' for='fnr-in.19.8903954' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.19.8903954' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup>
Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.
</span>. But instead of
accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I finally theorised that he
had taken in all the explanations of the various possible medical
interventions &#x2014; including their probabilities of success or failure
&#x2014; and built up hope that the death sentence of lung cancer could,
<i>should</i> be beaten by some technology lurking in some corner of the
modern medical labyrinth. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed death&rsquo;s arrival to
such an absurd degree. Today, however, the fourscore years spoken of
in Psalms has all but become an expectation of, a guaranteed minimum
implied by modern medicine&#x2014;even to the extent that old age and death
are increasingly spoken of as &ldquo;diseases&rdquo; we can and should
defeat. Death not inevitable ominous, rather, death a nuisance. My
father felt cheated when that three-, fourscore and more was not
forthcoming. I contend, however, life is life only with death. And
without death absolute a strange irrelevance begins to shake at life&rsquo;s
foundations. A sickly Anne Brontë<label id='fnr.20' for='fnr-in.20.2485738' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.20.2485738' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup>
Anne Brontë&rsquo;s grave in Scarborough <br>
<img src="images/AnneBrontesGrave2.png" alt="AnneBrontesGrave2.png">
<br>
</span> on her final dying trip to
Scarborough in 1849 had made a stop in York where she insisted on
seeing the York Minster. Upon gazing up at the great cathedral she
said, &ldquo;If finite power can do this&#x2026;&rdquo;  But then she was overcome with
emotion and fell silent. Anne was in a death mindset of utter and
complete humility and reverence. Contrast this with a modernist
triumphalist attitude of superiority towards a garish, outdated
edifice of religious superstition.

<blockquote>
<p>
The world must be romanticised. In this way we will find again its
primal meaning. Romanticising is nothing but raising to a higher power
in a qualitative sense. In this process the lower Self becomes
identified with a better Self &#x2026; When I give a lofty meaning to the
commonplace, a mysterious prestige to the usual, the dignity of the
unknown to the known, an aura of infinity to the finite, then I am
romanticising. For the higher, the unknown, the mystical, the
infinite, the process is reversed&#x2014;these are&#x2014;expressed in terms of
their logarithms by such a connection&#x2014;they are&#x2013;reduced to familiar
terms. <br>

<i>The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature&rsquo;s Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work</i> by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.
</span> author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to <i>thrive</i>, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, but wait,
haven&rsquo;t these bats jumped <i>outside</i> of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of <i>trans</i>-bat-ism. But is that a good thing?
For the bats maybe, but for nature as a whole?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps bats doing better is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis
the rest of their surrounding environment<label id='fnr.26' for='fnr-in.26.2252971' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.26.2252971' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup>
Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven&rsquo;t noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats&rsquo; primary food sources.
</span>. And yet what happens
when a species keeps thriving more and more, increasing its success
statistics, stepping over, beyond any of the natural restrictions that
real integration and harmony with nature would have required? <b>Aren&rsquo;t
we humans Exhibit A of just such an out-of-control species?</b> And so I
ask, how can this be good, end well?  How can a dominant species like
ours, which seems to be always &ldquo;gaming the system,&rdquo; evermore
extra-natural, not eventually have to pay some price? Simply put, How
can more and more people consuming more and more resources and energy,
each of us fantasising about reaching top-dog success and prosperity,
not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?
</p>

<p>
Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to its tightly integrated niche, then
exponential growth ensues&#x2014;which will eventually hit an inflexion
point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards an
inevitable overshoot and crash.
</p>

<p>
To my mind Emily Brontë was a sort of hard-pressed little bat out in
the wilds&#x2014;colony-less, huddled in a hollow tree, barely eking out a
marginal life. Here is her <i>Plead for me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Why I have persevered to shun<br>
The common paths that others run;<br>
And on a strange road journeyed on<br>
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—<br>
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.<br>
<br>
These once indeed seemed Beings divine,<br>
And they perchance heard vows of mine<br>
And saw my offerings on their shrine—<br>
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,<br>
And mine were worthily despised;<br>
<br>
My Darling Pain that wounds and sears<br>
And wrings a blessing out from tears<br>
By deadening me to real cares;<br>
And yet, a king—though prudence well<br>
Have taught thy subject to rebel.<br>
<br>
And am I wrong to worship where<br>
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,<br>
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?<br>
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me<br>
And tell why I have chosen thee!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I consider this her ode to skipping the trans-human thrive scene of
her day and striking out into some Beyond. Again, I must believe she
was a little bat driven across the semi-wilderness moorland, as true
an existential <i>underdog</i> as was still possible back
then<label id='fnr.27' for='fnr-in.27.1146624' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.27.1146624' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup>
Compare with today&rsquo;s outdoor adventurer with astronaut-like
gear from REI, Patagonia, North Face, driving to government set-aside
wilds in a Jeep Cherokee, consuming protein bars and electrolyte
drinks, taking smart phone pictures or GoPro videos.
</span>. Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced malnutrition,
contaminated water, tuberculosis &#x2014; pick one, two, or all
three&#x2014;five months after her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the
greater world outside of her tiny Haworth village and its surrounding
hills for a few months<label id='fnr.28' for='fnr-in.28.3468457' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.28.3468457' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup>
A stay in Belgium to learn French and a gig in nearby Halifax
as a governess.
</span>. Hers was a world with nothing modern as
we know it, e.g., a cut on a toe could lead to an infection requiring
amputation, or even worse.
</p>

<p>
But then one might ask if her existence in the early nineteen century
was really so very wild and rugged. Today we are swimming in
unprecedented levels of moder, high-tech materialism, i.e., one
hundred times the resources and energy per capita as one of our
European ancestors from 1800. But how close to nature was the
early-nineteenth-century citizen of Yorkshire?
</p>

<p>
When we imagine how the Romantic Era poets perceived and reported
nature, we think of picnics like from the Hollywood filming of Jane
Austen&rsquo;s <i>Emma</i> where dandies and their pampered ladies are attended
by servants at garden-like country estates
</p>

<img src="./images/EmmaPicnic2.png" width="770" alt="Emma picnic">
<span class="cap"><b>Emma</b> picnic in the harrowing wilds of England</span>

<p>
or playful romps like Hollywood&rsquo;s latest imagining of Emily Brontë
rolling down a grassy slope in some domesticated country setting
</p>

<span class="cap">Fictional E.B. in a silly, carefree moment tumbling down a hill</b><br>(From the 2022 film <b>Emily</b>) </span>

<p>
For modern tastes nature is nothing as tame as England back
then. Again, for us nature is a <i>place</i>, a <i>location</i> far away from
our modern interior spaces. Nature is the <i>Great Outdoors</i>.  The
farther afield from modern civilization we can go, the truer and more
authentic nature becomes. And so a <i>nature continuum</i> whereby a
trackless wilderness as far from civilization as possible is the
truest nature, while the least nature would be, e.g., a ditch
overgrown with weeds behind one of our forced-air-HVAC, triple-paned
windowed, vinyl-siding-clad suburban houses.

After writing on my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> for the past seven years
I have made a rather bitter discovery, namely, that mankind is largely
wandering about clueless &#x2014; <i>seriously</i> clueless.
</p>

<p>
One key turning point was to finally understand what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats">John Keats</a> meant
in his <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability">Negative Capability</a></i> letter to his brother. In it he describes
what he means by Negative Capability, the ability to not rush to
philosophical conclusion, rather, to let a sort of cognitive
dissonance run its course. But then Keats also condemns Samuel
Coleridge&rsquo;s obsession with philosophical truth, repudiating his
<i>Biographia Litararia</i>, which was Coleridge&rsquo;s attempt to, among other
things, bring the bulk of German Romanticism to a British audience.

<h3 id="orgaa12ae3">Grand Marais, my sepulchre by the sea?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgaa12ae3">
<p>
I live in the far-northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called North
Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, along the shore
before the Canadian border. This so-called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region">Arrowhead Region</a>&rdquo; holds
some three million-plus acres of wilderness on the shores of the
world&rsquo;s largest body (by surface area) of freshwater. And to my mind,
this is a very Dark Muse kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, I
cannot go. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but our dark vibe
here must be experienced to be really appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Though I&rsquo;m wont to call Lake Superior the <i>Inland Sea</i>, thus, North
Coast instead of North Shore. This is due to <i>her</i> being so much more
sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is something much
smaller and much friendlier. The Inland Sea is big and often violent
like any sea or ocean of saltwater. She&rsquo;s no simple lake for
beer-and-brats picnickers, windsurfers, speedboat and jet ski
riffraff<label id='fnr.29' for='fnr-in.29.2763838' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.29.2763838' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup>
Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her lasting more
than ten minutes can lead to hypothermia &#x2026; at least on the North
Coast. Wisconsin and Michigan beaches can be swimmable in the summer.
</span>. <i>She</i> has a mighty présence, often dark and moody if
not threatening.
</p>

<p>
A deep moodiness prevails. Here is nothing really spectacular in the
sense of the Great Outdoors overwhelming with one postcard vista after
another&#x2014;as we think of the American West and Alaska. Rather, here is
a more subtlety, more reserve, more mood.
</p>

<p>
Though I feel quite alone here in this assessment. My little
village, Grand Marais, the county seat, is only some thirteen hundred
souls. And yet as the years go by we are becoming evermore
suburban-like in mentality. Being a popular Northern Midwest resort
town, We have a steady stream of newcomers who increasingly are not
adapting to small-town life; instead, maintaining their aloof,
disengaged, blinkered urban-suburban ways. So often one encounters
another supposed fellow human&#x2014;only to receive the &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t exist&rdquo;
treatment common on a street in Manhattan.
</p>

<p>
Another social-psychology pitfall is how many people came up from a
Chicago or especially Twin Cities suburb ostensibly to reinvent
themselves. They&rsquo;ve made the leap out of the sterile, soulless
clone-bunny suburbia to now be some new version of themselves. They
typically use Hemingway and Jack London, i.e., a macho attitude about
wilderness and what. I call this <i>Neo-Klondikism</i>.
</p>

<p>
Steger etc. totally different from the real pioneers of late 19th-,
early 20th-century who brought Victorian civilization to the
wilderness.
</p>

<p>
Grand Marais is my &ldquo;sepulchre by the sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Quietude and contemplation in a place far from civilization.
