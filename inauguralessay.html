The purpose of this media effort will be to convey some of my thoughts
and impressions about all things dark, or what I call the <i>Dark
Muse</i>. Here is an example, a test of sorts from Emily Brontë <label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.6750642' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.6750642' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>

Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br>
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br>
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br>
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br>

Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>

This is a great litmus test for the Dark Muse: Either you &ldquo;get it&rdquo; or
you don&rsquo;t. Either it speaks to you, or you find it &#x2014; weird, morbid,
even sick or evil. Yes, many people associate an &ldquo;fixation&rdquo; on dark
with a disturbed mind &#x2014; depression, obsession with morbidity,
unwholesome, if not evil. This is certainly not my take on dark,
rather, I see dark from a purely aesthetic perspective, as key poets
from the early nineteenth century have informed me. Here is another
great example of &ldquo;you get nineteenth-century poet dark or you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
this time from Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s <label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.9891910' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.9891910' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>

<p>
That last line includes <i>Death</i>, capitalised. It is my contention that
these nineteenth-century creators had a completely different insight
to and understanding of death than we do today. And since this
capitalised, other-century view of Death has become so opaque, let us
talk a bit about what they really meant and what they really felt
about it.

<p>
➝ No &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; of nature, rather, nature uniform <br>
➝ Nature not a place, rather, nature universal <br>
➝ The increasingly extra-natural human
</p>

<p>
It is my contention that we today understand nature much differently
than did early-nineteenth-century poets such as the Haworth and
Amherst Emilies <label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.4963811' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.4963811' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson are based on
their towns of origin &#x2014; Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.
</span> and their contemporaries. If we just consider
shelter and dwelling spaces, a modern building is more like a sealed
spaceship landed on a hostile alien planet compared to indoor
environments of the not-so-distant past. Literally, the Brontës&rsquo;
Haworth parsonage, built between 1778 and 1779, had more in common
with human shelters from thousands of years previous than with our
houses only some two hundred years later. <i>In just these two to three
hundred years a very steep gradient has grown between indoors and
outdoors.</i> And this, in turn, has brought us to see nature more as a
<i>place</i> outside of our artificial, maximally sealed-off, high-tech
modern buildings. Which, in turn, leads to us rating the outdoors on
continua of relative wildness, as well as distance and remoteness from
our unnatural sealed-off indoor population centres.
</p>

<p>
No doubt humans have always made some sort of distinction between
indoors and outdoors, even before we began building permanent
city-states circa six thousand years ago. Down through the centuries
humans have spent more and more time in the <i>Great Indoors</i>, and these
indoor environments have been increasingly controlled and physically
removed from the natural world. In the West, architecture reached an
aesthetic crescendo in the nineteenth century as cities became
exponentially larger and increasingly &ldquo;indoorsy&rdquo; than even a century
or so before. And so the steepness and suddenness of our modern
indoor-versus-outdoor gradient has increased dramatically since
Western Victorian times, leading to the penultimate <i>extra-natural</i>
state in which humanity now find itself.
</p>

<p>
But then what could nature be if not that uncontrolled, unmanaged,
uncultivated, unregulated, unchecked, unruly landscape <i>outside</i>? <b>I
posit nature was once not a place, rather, <i>everything</i> &#x2014;
literally. In the past nature was the myriad cycles of birth, growth,
deterioration, and death going on everywhere, entirely without any
concept of in- or outdoors.</b> To be sure, the Brontës would have known
or at least sensed this more pre-modern meaning of <i>universal nature</i>
as countless life-and-death processes in concert than as a location
outside of inside.
</p>

<p>
With nature as cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and death, the
last component, death must be seen beyond our common modern take as
just mechanistic, physical malfunction. Instead, death becomes Death,
a quasi-spiritual <i>force majeure</i>. Death comes from old age, an
accident, or as the result of physical aggression or predation<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.5896210' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.5896210' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
For critters, predators are other critters. For humans,
predators are all but exclusively bacteria and viruses.
</span>. But
when death is an undeniable certainty, inevitable, and able to strike
at any time, then a completely different attitude dominates compared
to our modern experience of death as a negative outcome after modern
health care&rsquo;s labyrinth of diagnoses and repair attempts. Yes, of
course, life in our modern times can be precarious. But not half as
precarious as in the early nineteenth century. Death still may arrive
suddenly from an accident or violence. But
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<br>
&#x2014; Psalm 90:10<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its absolute
finalism, its resounding inevitability. Life is starkly contrasted by
death inescapable. Death is life&rsquo;s backstop against which any ball
thrown bounces back. Death is the walls of life&rsquo;s playpen or sandbox.
</p>

<p>
As opposed to the creeping attitude that death may be postponed, even
cheated. Psalm 90:10 by no means guarantees seventy years of life and
yet we have grown to expect some seventy, eighty, ninety, even longer,
as something due us by the modern world.
</p>

<p>
Let me relate a modern story to our new attitude towards death. My
father, who has since passed away, lost his <i>third</i> wife to lung
cancer caused inevitably by decades of smoking<label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.7312645' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.7312645' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.
</span>. But instead of
accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I finally theorised that he
had taken in all the explanations of all the various medical
interventions &#x2014; including their probabilities of success or failure
&#x2014; and built up hope that the death sentence of lung cancer could,
<i>should</i> be beaten by some technology in some corner of the modern
medical labyrinth.
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed death&rsquo;s arrival to
such an absurd degree. Today, however, the fourscore years spoken of
in Psalms almost seem like a guarantee of modern medicine &#x2014; even to
the extent that old age and death are &ldquo;diseases&rdquo; medical science can
and should be defeated. Hence, we feel cheated, as my father did, when
that three-, fourscore and more is not forthcoming. What is obviously
missing is a humility towards death.

<i>The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature&rsquo;s Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work</i> by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.
</span> the acclaimed author and
psychologist Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to
seek out the best conditions for <i>thriving</i>, that any life other than
one of maximised thriving is a waste. He uses the example of bats,
which according to research, seem to seek out human buildings,
preferring them over natural homes such as rock outcrops, hollow
trees, or caves. And in so doing this they enjoy benefits such as
better body temperature regulation, better infant mortality
statistics, less threat of predation. This may be true, but aren&rsquo;t
these bats now <i>outside</i> of the original constraints where they were
completely integrated with nature? They are now in a state of
<i>trans</i>-bat-ism, and can that be a good thing? Perhaps with bats this
is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis the rest of their
surrounding environment. However, what happens when a species
continues to expand this thriving, increases its success statistics,
evermore stepping over, past any of the natural restrictions that a
total integration with nature would have required? And aren&rsquo;t we
Exhibit A of just such a species? And so I ask, how can this end well?
How can a dominant species like ours always expand our thriving? How
can more and more people consuming more and more resources and energy
not result in an eventual disaster?

Today nature is something entirely outdoors, e.g., the <i>Great
Outdoors</i>.

<p>
After writing on my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> for the past seven years
I have made a rather bitter discovery, namely, that mankind is largely
wandering about clueless &#x2014; <i>seriously</i> clueless.
</p>

<p>
One key turning point was to finally understand what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats">John Keats</a> meant
in his <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability">Negative Capability</a></i> letter to his brother. In it he describes
what he means by Negative Capability, the ability to not rush to
philosophical conclusion, rather, to let a sort of cognitive
dissonance run its course. But then Keats also condemns Samuel
Coleridge&rsquo;s obsession with philosophical truth, repudiating his
<i>Biographia Litararia</i>, which was Coleridge&rsquo;s attempt to, among other
things, bring the bulk of German Romanticism to a British audience.
