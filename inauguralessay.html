The purpose of this media effort will be to convey some of my thoughts
and impressions about all things dark, or what I call the <i>Dark
Muse</i>. Here is an example, a test of sorts from Emily Brontë <label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.6422881' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.6422881' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>

Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br>
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br>
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br>
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br>

Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>

Unfortunately, many associate dark with depression, morbidity, if not
evil. This is certainly not my take on dark, rather, dark from a
purely aesthetic perspective. Here is another great example of &ldquo;you
either get dark or you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; this time from Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s <label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.5621129' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.5621129' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>

<i>There&rsquo;s a certain slant of light</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
There&rsquo;s a certain Slant of light,<br>
Winter Afternoons –<br>
That oppresses, like the Heft<br>
Of Cathedral Tunes –<br>
<br>
Heavenly Hurt, it gives us –<br>
We can find no scar,<br>
But internal difference –<br>
Where the Meanings, are –<br>
<br>
None may teach it – Any –<br>
&rsquo;Tis the seal Despair –<br>
An imperial affliction<br>
Sent us of the Air –<br>
<br>
When it comes, the Landscape listens –<br>
Shadows – hold their breath –<br>
When it goes, &rsquo;tis like the Distance<br>
On the look of Death –<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
The last line includes <i>Death</i>, capitalised. Why? I say they had a
completely different understanding and approach to death than we do
today. And since this capitalised, other-century Death has become so
opaque, thus, the main sticking point in today&rsquo;s understanding of
goth, gothic, the Dark Muse, let us talk a bit about their version of
Death.

➝ No &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; of nature, rather, nature uniform <br>
➝ Nature not a place, rather, nature universal <br>
➝ The increasingly extra-natural human
</p>

<p>
It is my contention that we today understand nature much differently
than early-nineteenth-century poets such as the Haworth and Amherst
Emilies <label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.7664790' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.7664790' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson are based on
their towns of origin &#x2014; Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.
</span> and their contemporaries. If we just consider shelter
and dwelling spaces, a modern building is more like a sealed spaceship
landed on a hostile alien planet compared to indoor environments of
the not-so-distant past. Literally, the Brontës&rsquo; Haworth parsonage,
built between 1778 and 1779, had more in common with human shelters
from thousands of years previous than with our houses only some two
hundred years later. <i>In just these two to three hundred years a very
steep gradient has grown between indoors and outdoors.</i> And this, in
turn, has brought us to see nature more as a place outside of our
artificial, maximally sealed-off, high-tech modern buildings. Which,
in turn, leads to us rating the outdoors on continua of relative
wildness, as well as distance and remoteness from our unnatural
sealed-off indoor population centres.
</p>

<p>
No doubt humans made some sort of distinction between indoors and
outdoors even before permanent-settlement civilization began as humans
built hamlets, towns, and permanent city-states circa six thousand
years ago. Down through the centuries more and more of humanity has
come into the <i>Great Indoors</i>, and controlled indoor environments have
been increasingly physically removed from the natural world. In the
West, architecture reached an aesthetic crescendo in the nineteenth
century as cities became exponentially larger and increasingly
&ldquo;indoorsy&rdquo; than even a century or so before. And so the steepness and
suddenness of our modern indoor-outdoor gradient has increased
dramatically since Western Victorian times, leading to the penultimate
<i>extra-natural</i> state in which humanity now find itself.
</p>

<p>
So what could nature be if not that uncontrolled, unmanaged,
uncultivated, unregulated, unchecked, unruly landscape outside? I
posit nature is not a place, rather, <i>everything</i> &#x2014; literally. <b>I
define nature as the myriad cycles of birth, growth, deterioration,
and death going on all around and everywhere, entirely without any
concept of in- or outdoors.</b> To be sure, the Brontës would have know
this more aboriginal meaning of nature as countless processes in
concert than a place outside of inside.
</p>

<p>
With this understanding of a more universal nature, i.e., cycles of
birth, growth, deterioration, and death, the last component,
deterioration and death go beyond mechanistic malfunction, i.e., a
negative outcome after modern health
care&rsquo;s labyrinth of diagnoses and repair attempts. Instead, death
becomes Death.   For other creatures death is either old age, or
</p>



<p>
Today nature is something entirely outdoors, e.g., the <i>Great
Outdoors</i>.

<p>
After writing on my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> for the past seven years
I have made a rather bitter discovery, namely, that mankind is largely
wandering about clueless &#x2014; <i>seriously</i> clueless.
</p>

<p>
One key turning point was to finally understand what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats">John Keats</a> meant
in his <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability">Negative Capability</a></i> letter to his brother. In it he describes
what he means by Negative Capability, the ability to not rush to
philosophical conclusion, rather, to let a sort of cognitive
dissonance run its course. But then Keats also condemns Samuel
Coleridge&rsquo;s obsession with philosophical truth, repudiating his
<i>Biographia Litararia</i>, which was Coleridge&rsquo;s attempt to, among other
things, bring the bulk of German Romanticism to a British audience.
