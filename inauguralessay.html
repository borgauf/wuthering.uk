Clouds hang low over the boreal forest, a light snow is falling,
ravens are dolefully croaking, and I&rsquo;m burning a daytime candle,
i.e., a great ambience to convey some of my thoughts and impressions
about things <i>dark</i>, or as I call it, the <i>Dark Muse</i><label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.612748' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.612748' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
<b>muse</b>: originally any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts, <i>or</i> a
state of deep thought or abstraction, <i>or</i> a source of
inspiration
</span>.
</p>

<p>
My Dark Muse would hopefully include, be a superset of what today is
called <i>goth</i><label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.1547790' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.1547790' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
The modern &ldquo;goth subculture&rdquo; as described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture">here</a> perhaps. In very
short, I believe they, like many, <i>sense</i> dark but only want to
express it, explore it through goth rock and goth fashion. Lots
more about why goth seems to be allergic to Dark Muse later&#x2026;
</span> and gothic &#x2026; meaning I hope to go deeper and
more elemental than most modern takes on dark. And so I ask, Do you
have an inexplicable affinity for things a tad gloomy? Do you find
dreamy what they find dreary &#x2026; as when a cloudy day like mine today
brings out a strangely sanguine melancholy &#x2026; or a stormy night is
frightening in a wonderfully thrilling sort of way? Does twilight
heighten your senses <i>and</i> calm your nerves? Perhaps you&rsquo;ve paused to
gaze transfixed<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.2080576' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.2080576' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
Tragic is how many people today have desensitised themselves
from becoming transfixed, no?
</span> upon an old, overgrown cemetery, or a lonely,
nondescript countryside scene. And of course you&rsquo;re quickly maxed-out
on happy-clappy, sunny-cheery<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.4534055' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.4534055' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
I call it <i>boosterism</i>, i.e., those people who always seem to
be positive &#x2026; and get miffed when you&rsquo;re not marching along in their
sunny-cheery everything&rsquo;s grand! parade.
</span>. You prefer candlelight over
artificial light, Victorian architecture over modernist Brutalism. And
wouldn&rsquo;t it be grand if every month (or every week!) we celebrated
Halloween? If yes to any of this, I&rsquo;m speaking to you.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s start with an example, a litmus test of sorts. I present here a
short, simple poem from my main darkness benefactress, the poet who
stands at the centre of everything I mean to say about dark&#x2014;one
Emily Jane Brontë! <label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.809251' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.809251' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
Oddly enough, I&rsquo;ve never read her <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and do
not intend to. However, her poetry I read continually, gleaning new
insights each time. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB">here</a> for a quick biography.
<br>
<img src="images/Emily_Brontë_by_Patrick_Branwell_Brontë_restored.jpg" alt="Emily_Brontë_by_Patrick_Branwell_Brontë_restored.jpg"> <br>
</span>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br>
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br>
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br>
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br>
I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br>
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Direct, blunt even. But there it is: <i>You either get it or you
don&rsquo;t</i>. Either she is speaking to something in you&#x2014;or you are
immediately put off and find it &#x2014; <i>weird</i> overwrought melodramatic
trite puerile morbid, even sick or evil.
</p>

<p>
Throughout well-lit society my penchant for dark things would be
considered morose, morbid, indicative of an unstable, labile mind,
that is to say, something needs curing, fixing, at the very least
avoided, not encouraged. But I must repudiate and stand my ground. I
hearken back to a time when dark was the currency, namely the early
nineteenth century, a time when key poets (e.g. the Brontës) showed us
how dark goes to the core of life.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s try another poem<label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.7697445' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.7697445' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
As I&rsquo;ve found, the Dark Muse finds its best, most concentrated
expression through poetry.
</span>. Here is Longfellow&rsquo;s <i>Snow-flakes</i> from a
collection published in 1863
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Out of the bosom of the Air,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,<br>

&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Silent, and soft, and slow<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Descends the snow.<br>
<br>
Even as our cloudy fancies take<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Suddenly shape in some divine expression,<br>
Even as the troubled heart doth make<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In the white countenance confession,<br>

</span>&#x2014;despair, grief, misery&#x2014;into more equanimous
states of sadness and melancholy through poetic expression, namely, by
reaching out to the natural world and <i>poetising</i><label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.7712675' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.7712675' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
The idea of poetising, the <i>poetisation</i> of nature and life was
central to the Romantic Movement. It parallels the long-standing
belief that we humans explain ourselves through, embed our lives in
narratives, in olden times with nature the stage.
</span>. This looking
to nature, so often in her darker, more mysterious garb, and poetising
was the modus operandi of my nineteenth-century poets. As if they
understood emotional pain, depression to be like a ravaging cancer or
virus that may eventually go into remission, but can never be entirely
eliminated while on Earth. In some inexplicable way nature and
darkness were healers in this remission process. And so I contend we
have lost the ability to move hardships and tragedy and the ensuing
emotional crises into a stasis remission melancholy, to find a modus
vivendi<label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.6571726' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.6571726' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
<i>modus vivendi</i>: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, <i>or</i> (literally) a way of living.
</span> with the trials and tribulations of life as they once
did.
</p>

<p>
To be sure humans suffer poorly, i.e., we can never <i>learn</i>, get used
to suffering. All we may do is accompany, usher the pain into the
backdrop of time. In this regard I would say my key nineteenth-century
poets had a better grasp of life than we do today. First and foremost,
they faced and accepted doom and fate, whereas we are facile
dismissive. They took the good and especially the bad of life and used
both to keep growing emotionally and spiritually. Depth was key. When
misfortune struck, they gave emotions free reign. They did not
<i>process</i> greif, greif <i>processed</i> them<label id='fnr.11' for='fnr-in.11.1922171' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.11.1922171' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup>
Consider Queen Victoria who wore mourning black from the time
of her husband, Prince Albert&rsquo;s death in 1861 to the end of her life
in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg upon losing her husband
Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. No one chivvied them along with their grief.
</span>. Pain management and
emotional support was humanised organic and natural.
</p>

<p>
Joy at best rumour. This condition was more prevalent in the past. And its
proper handling was paramount. Handling tragedy a sort of life-as-art
form. Life&rsquo;s slings and arrows found conjunction with nature,
darkness, and faith, thereby elevating the uniquely human experience
of suffering into an exquisite though ironic sublimity<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.2695846' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.2695846' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>
Lots and lots more on <i>sublimity</i> as we go. I promise.
</span>&#x2014;like
no other generation before or since. It was a deep exploration of our
humanness, the likes of which we&rsquo;ve not seen since, and, thus, I here
explore.
</p>

<p>
And still Dark<label id='fnr.13' for='fnr-in.13.9098208' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.13.9098208' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup>
Allow me the German noun capitalisation for poetic emphasis.
</span> remains a mystery. Often too the criticism of
how the Dark Muse glamourises, <i>wallows</i> in grief, in morosity. Again,
I disagree. Dark is something instinctual, cathartic, evocative,
centring. The fresh-cut rose elicits one response, but the faded rose
another&#x2014;deeper but for me never dysphoric. Here is something from my
novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Then the new cut rose: Initially beautiful, thereafter dried and
desiccated, lost forever its initial beauty and fragrance. Once
affording a glimpse of perfection, only reminiscent thereafter. Beauty
always some fleeting illusion or madness? Moreover its eclipse,
joining, leading the shadows of our relentless doom, our march to the
grave. And though I live in this momentary brilliance, I still search
my night shore; for until now I have known only of beauty’s haunting
rumour, of love’s promise, those slightest quickenings of things
necessarily rare and formerly peripheral. Yes, in this moment I may
have some of love’s bliss, but I know I will cherish with a larger,
more mature heart the memory thereof, an echo sent down life’s long,
clouded memory hall as the true and lasting blessing.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, there might have been a dinner invite back in the day. Let&rsquo;s see
another example of get-it-or-don&rsquo;t, this time from Emily Elizabeth
Dickinson<label id='fnr.14' for='fnr-in.14.5926638' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.14.5926638' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup>

In the third line, <i>Heft</i> means weight, heaviness; importance,
influence; <i>or</i> (archaic) the greater part or bulk of something.
</span>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">

<p>
Indeed. That last line includes <i>Death</i>, capitalised<label id='fnr.16' for='fnr-in.16.8324060' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.16.8324060' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup>
Again, Dickinson often employed the capitalising nouns for
poetic emphasis.
</span>. Let me
say again these nineteenth-century artists understood death much
differently than we do today. I believe this capitalised, past-century
view of Death has become opaque, lost, and in need of closer
investigation.

<p>
I hold that our modern, twenty-first-century understanding of nature
is in very essential ways different than that of
early-nineteenth-century poets such as the Haworth and Amherst
Emilies <label id='fnr.17' for='fnr-in.17.602338' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.17.602338' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup>
My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson is based on
their towns of origin &#x2014; Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.
</span> and their contemporaries. Just considering our indoor
living environments today, a typical modern building is more like a
sealed <i>space station</i> on a hostile alien planet compared to the
simpler, more primitive indoor environments of the not-so-distant
past. Literally, the Brontës&rsquo; Haworth parsonage, built in 1778 out of
local stone and wood and clay, had more in common with human shelters
from a thousand years previous than with our modern suburban homes
only some two hundred years later. Hence, <i>in just the past two to
three hundred years a very steep, vertical gradient has grown between
indoors and outdoors.</i> And this in turn has brought us to see nature
more as a <i>place</i> separate and outside of our artificial, high-tech,
controlled and regulated modern indoor spaces &#x2026; which, in turn, has
lead us to rate <i>outdoors nature</i> on continua of relative wildness and
remoteness from our sealed-off, self-contained, humans-only
environments<label id='fnr.18' for='fnr-in.18.3694950' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.18.3694950' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup>
By today&rsquo;s calculus my surrounding three-million-acre boreal
wilderness here on Lake Superior is seen by the modern recreational
tourist scene as the outdoors nature equivalent of a high-class,
luxury neighborhood like Beverley Hills or the Hamptons.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
As late as my own childhood I remember hearing the term <i>homespun</i> to
refer to a country bumkin, a hick from the sticks. It meant the person
in question wore clothing homemade from locally-sourced and spun
materials such as linen and wool rather than factory-made, retail
clothing. The Brontëan early-nineteenth century would have seen a
majority of the villagers wearing homespun, all but a few garments not
hand-tailored bespoke.<label id='fnr.19' for='fnr-in.19.6748046' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.19.6748046' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup>
Of course cotton was rapidly becoming a global commodity, both
cotton and wool fabrics being produced in steam-powered factories.
</span> And food of course was entirely
local. All in all, a person&rsquo;s daily resources were majority local, a
small bit coming from a nearby <i>market town</i>, while only the most
exotic items (e.g., a clock) would have come from farther
afield. Today, however, this supply pyramid is flipped: Nearly
everything comes from far, far away (e.g. China) while only a few
personal items would be from a local or even regional
source<label id='fnr.20' for='fnr-in.20.4463795' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.20.4463795' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup>
In any modern (non-organic Amazon Whole Foods-style)
supermarket I&rsquo;m sure less that 1% of the items come from a local
source. Nearly everything is shipped in from often <i>far</i> afar.
</span>. And so in Brontëan times a rural landscape was nature
as quasi-domesticated, a working partner. We, on the other hand,
hardly ever encounter a farmer or visit a farm. We rarely know where
our clothing came from. Nature as &ldquo;the land,&rdquo; as our provider is
completely abstracted away. And so the term <i>ecosystem</i> has arisen to
mean the human as a removed observer of scientifically tracked
interactions, nature analysed like the workings of a machine.
</p>

<p>
Surely humans have always made a distinction between being inside a
shelter and going outside into the so-called <i>elements</i>. But starting
some six thousand years ago we began to give up aboriginal nomadic
life with its direct daily contact with said elements to establish
permanent city-states supported by land-domineering monoculture
agriculture. And so indoor environments, embedded in ever-expanding
urban centres, became increasingly self-contained, self-referencing,
recursively derivative<label id='fnr.21' for='fnr-in.21.2281722' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.21.2281722' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., what is a garden but a derivative, a mock-up of an
original place out in the wilds, albeit with the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits left, weeded out?
</span>, evermore physically removed, walled off
from the wild natural world.
</p>

<p>
Along with this growing separation came mentalities, narratives
increasingly based indoors and <i>extra-natural</i> <label id='fnr.22' for='fnr-in.22.9319928' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.22.9319928' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup>
How often is a Shakespeare character out communing with
nature? Never&#x2026;?
</span>. Being indoors
meant we no longer were in direct contact with the nature spirits all
around; instead, praying to an extra-natural, off-world monotheistic
God in showcase churches<label id='fnr.23' for='fnr-in.23.4799897' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.23.4799897' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup>
&#x2026;typically built in the centre of a town or city on the
highest ground. I once heard that to this day no building in Vienna
may be constructed taller than the tower of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Cathedral.
</span>. Western architecture seemed to reach
a fantastical aesthetic crescendo in the Victorian nineteenth
century<label id='fnr.24' for='fnr-in.24.8880009' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.24.8880009' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup>
&#x2026;with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as a leading
style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
&ldquo;revivalist-nostalgic&rdquo; (Greek, Gothic, Italianate, Elizabethan, Queen
Anne, etc.), perhaps a hearkening back to times more integrated with
nature, with shallower gradients between indoors and outdoors?
</span>, coinciding with an exponential growth in urban
population which had passed an inflection point. Today the steepness
of our indoor-outdoor gradient has increased even more since Victorian
times &#x2026; resulting in a humanity more abstracted <i>extra-natural</i> than
ever. How then can we, a species seemingly capable of great
adaptability<label id='fnr.25' for='fnr-in.25.7683405' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.25.7683405' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup>
Adaptability leading to, A) a permanent alteration,
or B) a temporary allowance for less-that-optimal conditions,
supposing an eventual return to optimal conditions. We humans, I
contend, are B-adaptable. This means we are certainly no barometer
species or &ldquo;canary in the coal mine&rdquo; of our own well-being. We
routinely ignore our fellow canary-like humans, allowing them to
suffer and die, their warnings unheeded.
</span>, objectively measure our separation from nature?
What has domestic, urban, indoor living done to our brains, our sense
of belonging to the planet, to one another? How can we even begin to
trace back the many rabbit hole bifurcations, the chain of derivatives
we&rsquo;ve taken for all these centuries down, out, and away from <i>nature
pure</i>?  To be sure, we have a unique survivalism shown in our
collective will to make conditions better for us and us alone. We see
our dominion over, abstraction away, separation from nature as fate,
destiny. After all, our population doubling in less than fifty years
to eight billion<label id='fnr.26' for='fnr-in.26.4730221' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.26.4730221' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup>
Human population grew 60% between 1800 and 1900, and 260%
between 1900 and 2000.
</span> says something to our intention and ability to
dominate. And we seemed to have adapted our human narratives to this
separation<label id='fnr.27' for='fnr-in.27.7287627' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.27.7287627' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup>
Modern human narratives come at us as thousands upon thousands
of fictional novels, films, plays, while aboriginal peoples had myth
and legends timeless and unchanging. That alone&#x2026;
</span>. But is this sustainable?  Some of us have become
quite worried over the question of sustainability, this long arc of
estrangement from nature.<label id='fnr.28' for='fnr-in.28.6431519' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.28.6431519' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup>
Is our relatively gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling frog</a> metaphor?
</span> Let me suggest a different
understanding of nature, namely&#x2014;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Nature not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature as everything going on everywhere. Nature as the myriad cycles
of birth, growth, deterioration, and death roaring on everywhere.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, sensed
this pre-modern meaning of nature as <i>sans localisation</i> inside or
outside. Yes, one went outside, out into the elements. But once back
indoors, a Brontë was not so completely out of and above nature&rsquo;s
touch, influence, <i>doom</i> as we now fancy ourselves. Again, the cycles
of birth, growth, deterioration, and death were happening everywhere
<i>sans emplacement</i> <label id='fnr.29' for='fnr-in.29.8432432' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.29.8432432' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup>
Consider how the Industrial Revolution created urban
production landscapes vast and barren and completely outside of any
sort of nature, spatial or otherwise. Indeed, William Blake&rsquo;s &ldquo;satanic
mills.&rdquo;  This was a change never before seen, a huge step away from
the physical world being solely the purveyance of nature. Even when
the individual left his house he was still within a massive
concentration of extra-natural, human-exclusive activity.
</span>. Here again is Emily Brontë, her epic <i>The
night is darkening round me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The night is darkening round me,<br>
The wild winds coldly blow;<br>
But a tyrant spell has bound me,<br>
And I cannot, cannot go.<br>
<br>
The giant trees are bending<br>
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;<br>
The storm is fast descending,<br>
And yet I cannot go.<br>
<br>
Clouds beyond clouds above me,<br>
Wastes beyond wastes below;<br>
But nothing drear can move me;<br>
I will not, cannot go.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
She refers to the wilds as &ldquo;wastes&rdquo;<label id='fnr.30' for='fnr-in.30.513747' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>30</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.30.513747' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>30</sup>
In the day wilds were often referred to as wastelands.
</span> and as drear, and yet she
is transfixed, frozen to the spot&#x2014;and I cannot, cannot go, she
says. Subjective terms like wastes and drear remind of the age-old
attitude of nature as a terrible master, a sponsor of disaster and
death, something to get away from, hardly over which to wax
poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that, and to be sure,
sublimely. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared directly
into an enemy previously known as all-powerful and unforgiving, and in
so doing she sensed something deep and found sublimity<label id='fnr.31' for='fnr-in.31.3637241' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>31</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.31.3637241' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>31</sup>
More on Edmund Burke&rsquo;s (as well as Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s) false,
&ldquo;they don&rsquo;t get it at all&rdquo; tedium on sublimity later. In short,
<i>sublime</i> is what we may find beyond mere beauty, touching what
Dostoevsky is saying here: <i>There are seconds, they only come five or
six at a time, and you suddenly feel the <b>presence of eternal
harmony</b>, fully achieved. It is nothing earthly; not that it is
heavenly, but man cannot endure it in his earthly state. One must
change physically or die. The feeling is clear and indisputable. As if
you suddenly sense the whole of nature and suddenly say: yes, this is
true. This is not tenderheartedness, but simply joy.</i> Again, much more
later&#x2026;
</span> evoked,
then she brought to us in her lines of poetry a new way of being more
human.
</p>

<p>
With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around, the last two components, deterioration and
death, must be understood beyond our mechanistic modern take of just
terminal, physical breakage and malfunction<label id='fnr.32' for='fnr-in.32.234960' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>32</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.32.234960' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>32</sup>
&#x2026;as when a car is written off as &ldquo;totalled.&rdquo;
</span>. Especially death
become Death, a quasi-spiritual <i>force majeure</i>. But today
deterioration and death aren&rsquo;t what they used to be. It&rsquo;s almost as if
they were cordoned off&#x2014;at least under much greater human control
than ever before. <i>It&rsquo;s as if through modern medicine we have begun to
acquire a demi-godlike, proto-immortal veto power over physical
demise.</i> And with this control we have torn down, dismantled a great
component of spirituality, namely the reckoning of one&rsquo;s mortality
with a deity. Where once was supposed a mortal, physical plane below
an immortal, spiritual plane, we now would look only to the physical
plane as exclusive. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Though for the meantime death remains an undeniable certainty. Death
comes as it always has from old age, fatal accident, or from deadly
physical aggression or predation<label id='fnr.33' for='fnr-in.33.2751467' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>33</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.33.2751467' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>33</sup>
For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are&#x2014;outside of war and homicidal aggression&#x2014;all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.
</span>. But a completely different
attitude arises when modern healthcare&rsquo;s labyrinth of diagnoses,
drugs, procedures and surgeries routinely thwart what was once all but
unstoppable. And so we&rsquo;ve begun to lessen the mystery of Death,
overturn fate and doom.
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<br>
&#x2014; Psalm 90:10<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalistic,
absolute inevitability so resounding as to constantly shake and echo
through life. Death as life&rsquo;s backstop, container, timer, combinator,
reaper<label id='fnr.34' for='fnr-in.34.9466980' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.34.9466980' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup>
Consider <a href="https://youtu.be/SMNGhPgCKzw?si=L4HFHQuUTnP3j8I6">this goth version</a> of the classic rock song. Had this
been written in Brontëan times, it would have been no cheap,
sentimental gimmick.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
What then if we start to take command of death&rsquo;s agenda, rerouting
death&rsquo;s comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is making the point that by no
means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty years of life, and even if
we get them they might not be that great. And yet we have grown to
<i>expect</i> from the implicit promises of modern medical science a
healthy, quality seventy, eighty, ninety, or even more years. And so
modern medicine has disrupted the two last components of nature
ubiquitous cyclic, i.e., deterioration and death. Modern science has
lessened the wallop of tragedy, weakened overall the doominess of doom
by redefining life as the circuitry of organic machinery, a mechanism
that, in turn, is to be better and better repaired, maintained,
improved against entropic wear-and-tear<label id='fnr.35' for='fnr-in.35.7457306' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.35.7457306' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup>
Consider the commonplace heart pacemaker, a device that
literally commands the human heart with electronic pulses.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Let me relate a modern story to our new attitude towards death. My
father, who has since passed away, lost his <i>third</i> wife to lung
cancer caused inevitably by decades of smoking<label id='fnr.36' for='fnr-in.36.5135320' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.36.5135320' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup>
Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.
</span>. But instead of
accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I finally theorised that he
had explicated from all the buzz of the various possible medical
interventions &#x2014; including their probabilities of success or failure
&#x2014; a hope that the death sentence of lung cancer could, <i>should</i> be
beaten by some technology lurking in some corner of the modern medical
labyrinth. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed death&rsquo;s arrival to
such an absurd degree. Human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of death able to lap over at any time. But today
the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has all but become an
expectation of, a guaranteed minimum&#x2014;even to the extent that old age
and death are increasingly spoken of as &ldquo;diseases&rdquo; we can and should
defeat. Death a nuisance. My father felt cheated when that three-,
fourscore and more was not forthcoming. But as you may anticipate, I
contend life is life only with death&#x2014;death absolute and not
theorised away. God must be somewhere in all this.

silent. Anne was in a deep and personal death mindset of utter and
complete humility and reverence. Indeed, God was in her death<label id='fnr.38' for='fnr-in.38.1028746' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.38.1028746' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup>

discuss, I have a character saying yes, she would get in a time
machine and go back the Brontëan times. And if you faced a fifty-fifty
chance of dying from a now curable, fixable condition? her friend
asks. Yes, she replies, I would <i>trust</i> my life, and <i>trust</i> my death.

The world must be romanticised. In this way we will find again its
primal meaning. Romanticising is nothing but raising to a higher power
in a qualitative sense. In this process the lower Self becomes
identified with a better Self &#x2026; When I give a lofty meaning to the
commonplace, a mysterious prestige to the usual, the dignity of the
unknown to the known, an aura of infinity to the finite, then I am
romanticising. For the higher, the unknown, the mystical, the

<i>Freiherr</i> (Baron) von Hardenberg (1772&#x2014;1801), aka, <b>Novalis, who

<p>
Alas, but here is where I become quite the iconoclast, primarily by
insisting <i>nearly everyone has got Romanticism wrong!</i> I posit that
Novalis with his foundational HTTN took off in a straight line into
the Dark Muse like never before or since<label id='fnr.43' for='fnr-in.43.1536833' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>43</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.43.1536833' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>43</sup>

Try <a href="https://www.george-macdonald.com/etexts/hymns_to_night.html">this George MacDonald translation</a> as found in a
publication from 1897. Amazing how obscure unknown the keynote address
to the whole Romanticism convention has been. I&rsquo;ll try at a better,
annotated version soon.
</span>. Here&rsquo;s a small taste
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I feel the flow of<br>
Death&rsquo;s youth-giving flood;<br>
To balsam and æther, it<br>
Changes my blood!<br>
I live all the daytime<br>
In faith and in might:<br>
And in holy rapture<br>
I die every night.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
and just before
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
What delight, what pleasure offers <i>thy</i> life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night? Thy mother, it is she brings thee forth, and to her thou owest all thy glory.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Simply put, HTTN is the densest, purest testament to the Dark Muse
ever. As the legend tells, his inspiration came from was
grief-stricken after the death of his fifteen-year-old fiancée Sophie
von Kühn. Jena Set writer Ludwig Tieck described the teenage Sopie as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Even as a child, she gave an impression which&#x2013;because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely&#x2013;we must call superearthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.

<i>The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature&rsquo;s Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work</i> by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.
</span> author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to <i>thrive</i>, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, but wait,
haven&rsquo;t these bats jumped <i>outside</i> of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of <i>trans</i>-bat-ism. But is that a good thing?
For the bats maybe, but for nature as a whole?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps bats doing better is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis
the rest of their surrounding environment<label id='fnr.46' for='fnr-in.46.4602771' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>46</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.46.4602771' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>46</sup>
Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven&rsquo;t noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats&rsquo; primary food sources.
</span>. And yet what happens
when a species keeps thriving more and more, increasing its success
statistics, stepping over, beyond any of the natural restrictions that
real integration and harmony with nature would have required? <b>Aren&rsquo;t
we humans Exhibit A of just such an out-of-control species?</b> And so I
ask, how can this be good, end well?  How can a dominant species like
ours, which seems to be always &ldquo;gaming the system,&rdquo; evermore
extra-natural, not eventually have to pay some price? Simply put, How
can more and more people consuming more and more resources and energy,
each of us fantasising about reaching top-dog success and prosperity,
not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?
</p>

<p>
Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to its tightly integrated niche, then
exponential growth ensues&#x2014;which will eventually hit an inflexion
point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards an
inevitable overshoot and crash.
</p>

<p>
To my mind Emily Brontë was a sort of hard-pressed little bat out in
the wilds&#x2014;colony-less, huddled in a hollow tree, barely eking out a
marginal life. Here is her <i>Plead for me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Why I have persevered to shun<br>
The common paths that others run;<br>
And on a strange road journeyed on<br>
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—<br>
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.<br>
<br>
These once indeed seemed Beings divine,<br>
And they perchance heard vows of mine<br>
And saw my offerings on their shrine—<br>
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,<br>
And mine were worthily despised;<br>
<br>
My Darling Pain that wounds and sears<br>
And wrings a blessing out from tears<br>
By deadening me to real cares;<br>
And yet, a king—though prudence well<br>
Have taught thy subject to rebel.<br>
<br>
And am I wrong to worship where<br>
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,<br>
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?<br>
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me<br>
And tell why I have chosen thee!<br>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
I consider this her ode to skipping the trans-human thrive scene of
her day and striking out into some Beyond. Again, I must believe she
was a little bat driven across the semi-wilderness moorland, as true
an existential <i>underdog</i> as was still possible back

helicopter rescue on a satellite connection&#x2026; At some point we&rsquo;re

</span>. Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced malnutrition,
contaminated water, tuberculosis &#x2014; pick one, two, or all
three&#x2014;five months after her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the
greater world outside of her tiny Haworth village and its surrounding
hills for a few months<label id='fnr.48' for='fnr-in.48.8303622' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>48</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.48.8303622' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>48</sup>

as a governess.
</span>. Hers was a world with nothing modern as
we know it, e.g., a cut on a toe could lead to an infection requiring
amputation, or even worse.
</p>

<p>
Still, one might still ask if her existence in the early nineteen
century was really so very wild and rugged. Was she still not
observing nature from civilization&rsquo;s relative place of safety, thereby
rendering her observations just as relative as ours today? I say
no. Clearly our modern place of safety is maximal, as we of the
twenty-first century float above in unprecedented levels of modern
high-tech materialism<label id='fnr.49' for='fnr-in.49.4715933' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.49.4715933' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup>

When modern scoffers think of how the Romantic Era poets perceived and
reported nature, we might think of picnics where dandies and their
pampered ladies are attended by servants at garden-like country
estates like from the Hollywood film version of Jane Austen&rsquo;s <i>Emma</i>

or playful romps like Hollywood&rsquo;s latest anachronistic redo of Emily
Brontë depicting her rolling down a grassy slope in some domesticated
country setting

For modern tastes nature is nothing as seemingly tame as Hollywood&rsquo;s
England back then. Again, for us nature is a <i>place</i>, a <i>location</i> far
away from our modern interior spaces. Nature is the <i>Great
Outdoors</i>. Again, the farther afield from modern civilization we can
go, the truer and more authentic nature supposedly becomes. And so a
<i>nature continuum</i> whereby a trackless wilderness as far from
civilization as possible is the truest nature, while the least nature
would be, e.g., a ditch overgrown with weeds behind one of our
forced-air-HVAC, triple-paned windowed, vinyl-siding-clad suburban
houses. Nature can only be very wild, thus, very far away from the
safety of civilization. Writers like Ernest Hemingway and Jack London
exploit this fright memes of nature as a distant, hostile place. Which
is virtually identical to science fiction stories of hostile alien
planets &ldquo;conquered&rdquo; by brave, intrepid astronauts. To be sure, many
sci-fi depictions of alien worlds are simply off-Earth versions of
London&rsquo;s Klondike Yukon.

After writing on my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> for the past seven years
I have made a rather bitter discovery, namely, that mankind is largely
wandering about clueless &#x2014; <i>seriously</i> clueless.
</p>

<p>
One key turning point was to finally understand what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats">John Keats</a> meant
in his <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability">Negative Capability</a></i> letter to his brother. In it he describes
what he means by Negative Capability, the ability to not rush to
philosophical conclusion, rather, to let a sort of cognitive
dissonance run its course. But then Keats also condemns Samuel
Coleridge&rsquo;s obsession with philosophical truth, repudiating his
<i>Biographia Litararia</i>, which was Coleridge&rsquo;s attempt to, among other
things, bring the bulk of German Romanticism to a British audience.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga545836">
<p>
I live in the far-northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called North
Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, along the shore
before the Canadian border. This so-called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region">Arrowhead Region</a>&rdquo; holds
some three million-plus acres of wilderness on the shores of the
world&rsquo;s largest body (by surface area) of freshwater. And to my mind,
this is a very Dark Muse kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, I
cannot go. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but our dark vibe
here must be experienced to be really appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Though I&rsquo;m wont to call Lake Superior the <i>Inland Sea</i>, thus, North
Coast instead of North Shore. This is due to <i>her</i> being so much more
sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is something much
smaller and much friendlier. The Inland Sea is big and often violent
like any sea or ocean of saltwater. She&rsquo;s no simple lake for
beer-and-brats picnickers, windsurfers, speedboat and jet ski
riffraff<label id='fnr.50' for='fnr-in.50.1503' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>50</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.50.1503' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>50</sup>
Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her lasting more
than ten minutes can lead to hypothermia &#x2026; at least on the North
Coast. Wisconsin and Michigan beaches can be swimmable in the summer.
</span>. <i>She</i> has a mighty présence, often dark and moody if
not threatening.
</p>

<p>
A deep moodiness prevails. Here is nothing really spectacular in the
sense of the Great Outdoors overwhelming with one postcard vista after
another&#x2014;as we think of the American West and Alaska. Rather, here is
a more subtlety, more reserve, more mood.
</p>

<p>
Though I feel quite alone here in this assessment. My little
village, Grand Marais, the county seat, is only some thirteen hundred
souls. And yet as the years go by we are becoming evermore
suburban-like in mentality. Being a popular Northern Midwest resort
town, We have a steady stream of newcomers who increasingly are not
adapting to small-town life; instead, maintaining their aloof,
disengaged, blinkered urban-suburban ways. So often one encounters
another supposed fellow human&#x2014;only to receive the &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t exist&rdquo;
treatment common on a street in Manhattan.
</p>

<p>
Another social-psychology pitfall is how many people came up from a
Chicago or especially Twin Cities suburb ostensibly to reinvent
themselves. They&rsquo;ve made the leap out of the sterile, soulless
clone-bunny suburbia to now be some new version of themselves. They
typically use Hemingway and Jack London, i.e., a macho attitude about
wilderness and what. I call this <i>Neo-Klondikism</i>.
</p>

<p>
Steger etc. totally different from the real pioneers of late 19th-,
early 20th-century who brought Victorian civilization to the
wilderness.
</p>

<p>
Grand Marais is my &ldquo;sepulchre by the sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Quietude and contemplation in a place far from civilization.
