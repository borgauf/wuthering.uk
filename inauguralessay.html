Light snow drifts gently down from low clouds draped over a misty
boreal forest. Deer in their grey winter coats process through the fir
and spruce. Ravens and crows dolefully croak and caw back and
forth. And I burn a daytime candle. Such an ambience to convey my
thoughts about my <i>Dark Muse</i><label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.572549' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.572549' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
<i>muse</i>: Any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts, <i>or</i> a state of
deep thought or abstraction, e.g., to enter a <i>muse</i> over a poem, <i>or</i> a
source of inspiration, e.g., <i>She is my muse</i>.

Do you have an affinity for things on the gloomy side?  Do you find
dreamy what they find dreary &#x2026; like when an overcast day brings on a
strangely sanguine melancholy &#x2026; or a stormy night is magnificent in
a frightening and thrilling sort of way? Is twilight like a strange
reprieve freeing your senses <i>and</i> deepen your thoughts? Perhaps
you&rsquo;ve paused to gaze transfixed upon an old, abandoned cemetery, or a
lonely, nondescript landscape. And of course you are somewhere between
panic and nausea by attempts at happy-clappy, sunny-cheery. You prefer
candlelight over artificial light, old architecture over new, the
genial disorder of wild nature over predictably orderly gardens. If
you do live in a city, you gravitate to the &ldquo;old town.&rdquo; Spectacular
is ho-hum, but all things subtle and veiled are magnetic. And wouldn&rsquo;t
it be grand if every month (or week!) we celebrated Halloween? If yes
to any of this, you might understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say here.

The first elephant I should at least slightly shift from the very
centre of the room is the modern <i>goth subculture</i><label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.1716693' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.1716693' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
&#x2026;described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture">here</a> as well as anywhere. In very short, I believe
they, like many, surely <i>sense</i> dark, but for whatever reasons only
want to express it, explore it very narrowly through goth music and
fashion. Lots more about why goth seems to skip the Dark Muse later&#x2026;
</span>, along with
all the <i>gothic</i> horror fright memes&#x2014;vampires, witches, demons,
nasty mean this, campy evil that. Yes, my Dark Muse would hopefully
include, be akin to what is today called goth and gothic, but I hope
to go deeper and more elemental and speak to your &ldquo;inner goth.&rdquo; There
is <i>natural dark</i>, the darkness nature provides. Contrast with
human-made dark, the symbolisms with which we attempt to emulate,
decorate, magnify natural dark. Right up front: My version of dark is
not meant to shock or frighten. My Dark Muse contains nothing cruel
nor evil nor sinister nor satanic<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.9481302' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.9481302' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
As philosopher and psychologist John Vervaeke said in
describing the modern crisis of anxiety and dysphoria, &ldquo;Horror is the
<i>aesthetic</i> of when you feel like you&rsquo;re losing your grip on reality.&rdquo;
Nothing to gain with horror memes. Not going there&#x2026;
</span>. Not the <i>Star Wars</i> &ldquo;dark
side,&rdquo; not dark barbarism à la <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, and not the
psychic dark described by Freud or Jung. I&rsquo;m after something more
subtle, discriminating, and inward-personal. <b>To me dark is
sublime.</b> And so I hearken back to a golden era when dark
was the cultural currency, to be sure, the early nineteenth century, a
time when key poets (e.g. Poe, the Brontës) showed us how triste and
Stygian can lead to subtlety and sublimity<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.2232248' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.2232248' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
Indeed, <i>sublimity</i>. More on Edmund Burke&rsquo;s (as well as
Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s) false, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t get it at all&rdquo; tedium on
<i>sublimity</i> later. In short, <i>sublime</i> is what we may find beyond mere
beauty, touching what Dostoevsky is saying here: <i>There are seconds,
they only come five or six at a time, and you suddenly feel the
<b>presence of eternal harmony</b> fully achieved. It is nothing earthly;
not that it is heavenly, but man cannot endure it in his earthly
state. One must change physically or die. The feeling is clear and
indisputable. As if you suddenly sense the whole of nature and
suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not tenderheartedness, but
simply joy.</i> &#x2026; Perhaps awe instead of joy? Again, much more as we go
along&#x2026;
</span>. I mean a dark that
one will not outgrow, rather, that sustains. There should be no &ldquo;aging
out of the scene,&rdquo; rather, a continued deepening and widening and
transcendence for one&rsquo;s entire life.

Another ox gored is my rejection of modern dumbed-down American street
English, which has permeated modern society&#x2014;virtually
worldwide. Basically, I mean to sound more erudite, sophisticated,
intellectual with my sort of past-century British-feeling
English. Why?  Simply because the English of the early-nineteenth
century was like a thoroughbred race horse, sleek and powerful and
capable of amazingly deep and expressive things; whilst modern
American street English is beggared, destitute, impoverished and
requires a buy-in to a particularly base, ignorant, crude and
aggressive hipster Zeitgeist. Which I repudiate, not going
there&#x2014;although I&rsquo;m sure I will occasionally slip up. Back in the day
people were more genteel, thoughtful, fine-spoken. They could express
themselves with utter sublimity. They understood the human need for
holiness, grandeur, the eternal. Compare this with the modernists we
see everywhere today who believe being coarse, crass, base, and
irreverent is somehow progress&#x2026; But on the other hand, it might just
be that I&rsquo;ve finally succumbed to the influence of all those
schoolmarms back in my distant childhood who had us read Romantic Era
lit, holding up &ldquo;wordy,&rdquo; other-century English as superior. They were
right, you know. And yes, I&rsquo;ll occasionally drop foreign as well as
Latin words and phrases, my foreign language being German&#x2026; You have
been warned.

For me life seems empty, insipid, weak without a strong current of the
Dark Muse. It is as if life cannot be properly understood without the
dark perspective. But is this nature or nurture? A quick litmus
test. I present here a short, simple poem from my main darkness
benefactress, the poetess who stands at the centre of everything I
mean to say about dark, namely, Emily Jane Brontë. <label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.852288' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.852288' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
Oddly enough, I&rsquo;ve never read her <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and do
not intend to. However, her poetry I read continually, discovering new
things, gleaning deeper insights each time. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB">here</a> for a quick
biography.  <br>
<img src="images/Emily_Brontë_by_Patrick_Branwell_Brontë_restored.jpg" alt="Emily_Brontë_by_Patrick_Branwell_Brontë_restored.jpg"> <br>
</span>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br>
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br>
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br>
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br>
I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br>
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Here EB is direct, blunt even. But now we know. Either she speaks to
something in you, or you are part of the majority who finds it&#x2014;weird,
abnormal, morbid, overwrought, puerile, even sick or evil. To be sure,
my dark <i>penchant</i> gets mostly deer-in-headlights responses, if not
outright hostility. The openly hostile see my dark druthers as morose,
morbid, as &ldquo;wallowing in self-pity&rdquo; or &ldquo;dwelling on the negative.&rdquo; I
beg to differ&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Here is something a bit lighter but the same basic idea from
<i>Christina Rossetti</i> <label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.1471703' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.1471703' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Rossetti">here</a> for a bio. She is considered by many Britain&rsquo;s
most prolific poet. <br>
<img src="images/RossettiAge16.jpg" alt="RossettiAge16.jpg"> <br>
</span>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Fade tender lily,<br>
Fade O crimson rose,<br>
Fade every flower<br>
Sweetest flower that blows.<br>
<br>
Go chilly Autumn,<br>
Come O Winter cold;<br>
Let the green things die away<br>
Into common mould.<br>
<br>
Birth follows hard on death,<br>
Life on withering:<br>
Hasten, we shall come the sooner<br>
Back to pleasant Spring.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Rossetti would carefully exposit a dark fatalism, ending with hope
bound in humble expectancy. I like to think these two English
poetesses are expressing an informed, matured melancholy that bespeaks
a deeper understanding of life.
</p>

<p>
And another poem<label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.8101394' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.8101394' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
Yes, poems. as the Dark Muse seems to find its best, most
concentrated expression through poetry. Much more on why mainly poetry
delivers the ineffable of darkness later.
</span>, here Longfellow&rsquo;s <i>Snow-flakes</i> from a
collection published in 1863
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Out of the bosom of the Air,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,<br>
Over the woodlands brown and bare,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Over the harvest-fields forsaken,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Silent, and soft, and slow<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Descends the snow.<br>
<br>
Even as our cloudy fancies take<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Suddenly shape in some divine expression,<br>
Even as the troubled heart doth make<br>

&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The grief it feels.<br>
<br>
This is the poem of the air,<br>

Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow">here</a> for a quick biography. HWL was not typically dark,
rather, a popular &ldquo;uplifting&rdquo; poet with a big audience. That&rsquo;s what
makes this selection so unique for me.
</span> looking to the natural world and
<i>poetising</i><label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.7200933' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.7200933' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
The idea of poetising, the <i>poetisation</i> of nature and life was
central to the Romantic Movement. It parallels the long-standing
belief that we humans explain ourselves through, embed our lives in
narratives, and in olden times nature was the stage.
</span>, to be sure, <i>darkly</i>. As a result, agents of mental
affliction and depression&#x2014;despair, grief, misery&#x2014;are transformed
into more equanimous states of sadness and melancholy hopefully
resulting in a higher emotional maturity. In some paradoxical way,
nature and darkness as witnesses eventually transition into
healers. As if the initial agony and sorrow are a ravaging cancer or
virus that eventually fade into remission, but can never entirely be
eliminated whilst on Earth.
</p>

<p>
This <i>poetising</i> of nature dark and mystical was the modus operandi of
my select nineteenth-century poets<label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.711221' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.711221' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
Dark as a teacher. Novalis, who we&rsquo;ll meet later,
described in exceptionally moving poetic terms the night as a soother
and healer.
</span>. Rather than avoid, they
<i>embraced the dark</i>, something we today in our brightly-lit,
cordoned-off world might consider counter-intuitive, if not
wrong-headed. I contend we have lost this subtle art of moving
hardship, tragedy, emotional crises into a stasis remission
melancholy. Too often we are failures at finding a <i>modus
vivendi</i><label id='fnr.11' for='fnr-in.11.3252421' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.11.3252421' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup>
<i>modus vivendi</i>: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, <i>or</i> (literally) a way of living.
</span> with the trials and tribulations of life as our
ancestors once did.
</p>

<p>
Surely we suffer poorly. All we may ever do is usher the initially
searing, inescapable pain to a dull ache in the backdrop of
time. Though I would say this was better understood in the past than
today. They did not attempt to contain, disguise, systematise or
<i>process</i> greif, rather, greif was faced directly, pain was shared,
empathy a way of life. And so emotional space was allotted,
support communal, organic, and natural. Strikingly different from
today was their acceptance of doom and fate, two concepts antithetical
to our dynamic, positivist, self-determining, fix-everthing-quickly
modern attitudes.
</p>

<p>
Consider Queen Victoria<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.7408686' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.7408686' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>
Queen Victoria in mourning black ca. 1862. <br>
<img src="images/QueenVictoriaInMourningBlack.jpg" alt="QueenVictoriaInMourningBlack.jpg"> <br>
<br>
</span> who wore mourning black from the time
of her husband Prince Albert&rsquo;s death in 1861 till the end of her life
in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg who upon losing her husband
Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. In those days death was properly, officially mourned. No one
chivvied mourners along with their grief and sadness. Contrast this
with today&rsquo;s all-too-prevalent disassociation, the confused,
disorganised quasi-denial and suppression we moderns show towards
death<label id='fnr.13' for='fnr-in.13.9115149' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.13.9115149' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup>
Is there anything worse than the so-called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief">five stages of
grief</a></i> or the Kübler-Ross model? Grief as an emotional malfunction
to be systematically reduced, fixed, corrected? Alas.
</span>. For the early nineteenth century, poetising life&rsquo;s train
of tragedy was depression deconstruction as a life skill. The slings
and arrows of human existence found conjunction with <i>nature</i>,
<i>darkness</i>, and <i>faith</i> through poetry, thereby highlighting,
elevating our uniquely human experience on Earth, casting a gossamer
of sublimity over our natural existence like no other generation
before or since. Theirs was the deepest exploration of our true
humanness that I know, and, thus, something I must pursue.

Allow me German noun capitalisation for poetic emphasis.
</span>? Dark speaks to me, but, again, why? Lack
of a clear and simple answer begs a wordier one. Dark remains
mysterious&#x2014;no matter how I try to imbibe or express it. Dark is
something instinctual, cathartic, evocative, centring for me. Dark is
more than the lack of light. Dark can lead the imagination to
riot. The moss, lichens, and mushrooms in the secretive shadows of the
forest incite so much more than the spectacular sunny vista across the
forest valley. The fresh-cut rose elicits one response, but the faded
rose another&#x2014;deeper but for me never dysphoric. Here is something
from my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i><label id='fnr.15' for='fnr-in.15.1650310' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.15.1650310' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup>
Lots more about my novel as we go.
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The new cut rose: Initially beautiful, thereafter dried and
desiccated, lost forever its initial beauty and fragrance. Once
affording a glimpse of perfection, only reminiscent thereafter. Beauty
always some fleeting illusion or madness? Moreover its eclipse,
joining, leading the shadows of our relentless doom, our march to the
grave. And though I live in this momentary brilliance, I still search
my night shore; for until now I have known only of beauty’s haunting
rumour, of love’s promise, those slightest quickenings of things
necessarily rare and formerly peripheral. Yes, in this moment I may
have some of love’s bliss, but I know I will cherish with a larger,
more mature heart the memory thereof, an echo sent down life’s long,
clouded memory hall as the true and lasting blessing.

Yes, there might have been a dinner invite for me back in the day.

Let&rsquo;s see another example of get-it-or-don&rsquo;t, this time a poem from
Emily Elizabeth Dickinson<label id='fnr.16' for='fnr-in.16.1165058' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.16.1165058' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup>

In the third line, <i>Heft</i> means weight, heaviness; importance,
influence; <i>or</i> (archaic) the greater part or bulk of something.
</span>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
There&rsquo;s a certain Slant of light,<br>

Indeed. That last line includes <i>Death</i> capitalised<label id='fnr.18' for='fnr-in.18.5913226' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.18.5913226' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup>
Again, Dickinson often employed the capitalising of nouns for
poetic emphasis.
</span>. Now I must
emphasise these nineteenth-century artists understood death much
differently than we do today. Unfortunately, this capitalised,
past-century view of Death has become opaque, lost. I hope to
rediscover it. I&rsquo;ll start by stating their understanding of Death was
integral to their understanding of nature&#x2026;

I hold that our modern, twenty-first-century understanding of nature
is very different than that of early-nineteenth-century poets such as
the Haworth and Amherst Emilies<label id='fnr.19' for='fnr-in.19.3919073' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.19.3919073' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup>
My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson is based on
their towns of origin &#x2014; Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.
</span> and their contemporaries. Just
considering our indoor living environments today, a typical modern
building is more like a sealed <i>space station</i> plopped down on a
hostile alien planet compared to the simpler, more primitive
structures of the not-so-distant past. Quite literally, the Brontës&rsquo;
Haworth parsonage, built in 1778 out of local stone and wood and clay,
had more in common with human shelters from one, <i>two</i> thousand years
previous than with our modern suburban homes only some two hundred
years later<label id='fnr.20' for='fnr-in.20.7474389' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.20.7474389' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup>
Deep indoors deep in the forest&#x2026; <br>
<img src="images/MaxIndoorsOutdoorsGradient.png" alt="MaxIndoorsOutdoorsGradient.png"> <br>
<br>
</span>. Hence, <i>in just the past two to three hundred
years a very steep, vertical gradient or differential has grown
between indoors and outdoors</i>. This, in turn, has brought us to see
nature more as a <i>place</i> separate and outside, cut off, away from our
artificial, high-tech, controlled and regulated modern indoor
spaces<label id='fnr.21' for='fnr-in.21.8006679' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.21.8006679' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup>
Is it not ironic how nearly every lifeform that attempts to
share our human environments uninvited are considered invasive,
noxious vermin, pests to which we have developed almost hysterical
revulsion?
</span> &#x2026; which, in turn, has lead us to rate <i>outdoors
nature</i> on continua of relative wildness and remoteness from our
sealed-off, self-contained, humans-only environments.

<span class="cap">Homespun and one of its sources. Original art from Steve-Lease (DeviantArt.com)</span>

</p>

<p>
Even as late as my own childhood the term <i>homespun</i> was in use to
indicate a poor, unsophisticated person, a country bumkin, a hick from
the sticks. The term referred to a person&rsquo;s clothing being homemade
from locally-sourced, hand-spun and woven materials such as linen and
wool rather than factory-made retail clothing. The early-nineteenth
century Brontëan Yorkshire would have seen the majority of the
villagers in homespun, all but a few garments not hand-tailored
bespoke<label id='fnr.22' for='fnr-in.22.2219476' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.22.2219476' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup>
Cotton was rapidly becoming a global commodity, both cotton
and wool fabrics eventually being produced in steam-powered factories
as the Industrial Age reached its inflexion point of growth.
</span>. And of course food was entirely from local
production. Hence, a person&rsquo;s daily resources were overwhelmingly
local, a small bit perhaps coming from a nearby <i>market town</i>, while
only the most exotic items (e.g., a clock) would have come from
farther away. Today, however, this supply pyramid is completely
flipped, as nearly everything comes from far (far!) away (e.g. China)
while only a few personal items would be from a local or even regional
source<label id='fnr.23' for='fnr-in.23.3691904' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.23.3691904' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup>
In any modern (non-organic Amazon Whole Foods-style)
supermarket I&rsquo;m sure less that 1% of the food items come from a truly
local source. Nearly everything is shipped in from often far afar.
</span>. And so in Brontëan times the surrounding land was
agriculturally domesticated, a working partner. Contrast this with
today&rsquo;s urban-suburban populations hardly ever in contact with farmers
or their farms. Nor do we know anything about where our clothing came
from. Today, nature as &ldquo;the land,&rdquo; as our immediate provider, has been
completely abstracted into concepts such as <i>ecosystems</i>, which
implies we are now removed observers controlling nature as if it were
a mechanical object.
</p>

<p>
No doubt we have always made a distinction between being <i>inside</i> a
shelter and going <i>outside/Th into the so-called /elements</i>. But
starting some six to ten thousand years ago we began to give up
aboriginal nomadic life and its direct daily contact with said
elements in order to establish permanent city-states supported by mass
monoculture agriculture. And so indoor environments in ever-expanding
urban centres became evermore physically removed, walled off from the
wild natural world, became increasingly self-contained,
all-encompassing, self-referencing, thus, <i>recursively
derivative</i><label id='fnr.24' for='fnr-in.24.4693493' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.24.4693493' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., what is a flower garden but a derivative, a mock-up
of an original place out in the wilds, albeit with the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits left, weeded out?
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Along with this growing separation came mentalities, narratives
increasingly based indoors and <i>extra-natural</i> <label id='fnr.25' for='fnr-in.25.7288065' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.25.7288065' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup>
How often is a Shakespeare character out communing with
nature? Never?&#x2026;
</span>. Being indoors
meant we no longer were in direct contact with the nature spirits all
around; instead, praying to an extra-natural, off-world monotheistic
God in architectural showcase churches<label id='fnr.26' for='fnr-in.26.6487660' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.26.6487660' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup>
Churches were typically built in the centre of a town or city
on the highest ground. I once heard that to this day no building in
Vienna may be built taller than the tower of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Cathedral.
</span>. Western architecture
seemed to reach a fantastical aesthetic crescendo in the Victorian
nineteenth century<label id='fnr.27' for='fnr-in.27.4666375' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.27.4666375' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup>
&#x2026;with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as a leading
style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
&ldquo;revivalist-nostalgic&rdquo; (Greek, Gothic, Italianate, Elizabethan, Queen
Anne, etc.), perhaps a hearkening back to times more integrated with
nature, with shallower gradients between indoors and outdoors?
</span>, coinciding with an exponential growth in
urban population which had just passed an inflection point. Today the
steepness of our indoor-outdoor gradient has increased even more since
Victorian times &#x2026; resulting in a humanity more abstracted
<i>extra-natural</i> than ever. How then may we, a species seemingly
capable of great adaptability<label id='fnr.28' for='fnr-in.28.600043' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.28.600043' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup>
Adaptability leading to, A) a permanent (beneficial)
alteration, or B) a temporary adjustment, allowance for
less-that-optimal conditions, supposing an eventual return to optimal
conditions. We humans, I contend, are B-adaptable. This means we are
certainly no barometer species or &ldquo;canary in the coal mine&rdquo; of our own
well-being. We routinely ignore our fellow canary-like humans,
allowing them to suffer and die, their warnings unheeded.
</span>, objectively measure our
separation from nature?  What has domestic, urban, indoor living done
to our brains, our sense of belonging to the planet, to one another?
How can we even begin to trace back the many rabbit hole bifurcations,
the chain of derivatives we&rsquo;ve taken for all these centuries down,
out, and away from <i>nature pure</i>?  To be sure, we have demonstrated a
collective will to make conditions better for us and us alone. We see
our dominion over, abstraction away, separation from nature as fate,
as destiny. After all, our population doubling in less than fifty
years to eight billion<label id='fnr.29' for='fnr-in.29.2765996' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.29.2765996' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup>

</span> says something to our intention and
ability to dominate. And we seem to have adapted our collective human
psyche, our narratives to this separation<label id='fnr.30' for='fnr-in.30.1803119' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>30</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.30.1803119' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>30</sup>
Modern human narratives come at us as thousands upon thousands
of fictional novels, films, plays, while aboriginal peoples had myth
and legends timeless and unchanging. That alone&#x2026;
</span>. <i>But is this
sustainable?</i> All dark musings aside, many of us today have grown
concerned over the question of sustainability, concerned about our
long arc of estrangement from nature<label id='fnr.31' for='fnr-in.31.5679331' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>31</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.31.5679331' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>31</sup>
Is our relatively gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling frog</a> metaphor?
</span>. Let me suggest a
different understanding of nature, namely&#x2014;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Nature is not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature is everything going on everywhere. Nature as the myriad cycles
of <b>birth</b>, <b>growth</b>, <b>deterioration</b>, and <b>death</b> going on
everywhere.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era<label id='fnr.32' for='fnr-in.32.8478366' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>32</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.32.8478366' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>32</sup>
The term Romanticism originated is from the Latin <i>romant</i>,
or, &ldquo;in the Roman manner&rdquo;, thus, not at all our current use of the
word as a synonym of love.
</span> poets, sensed
this pre-modern meaning of nature as beyond inside or outside. Yes,
one went outside, out into the elements. But once back indoors, a
Brontë was not so completely out of and above nature&rsquo;s touch,
influence, <i>doom</i> as we now fancy ourselves. Again, the cycles of
birth, growth, deterioration, and death were happening everywhere
<i>sans emplacement</i> <label id='fnr.33' for='fnr-in.33.7457167' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>33</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.33.7457167' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>33</sup>
Consider how the Industrial Revolution created urban
production landscapes vast and barren and completely outside of any
sort of nature, spatial or otherwise&#x2014;indeed, William Blake&rsquo;s
&ldquo;satanic mills.&rdquo;  This was a change on a scale never before seen, a
huge and sudden step away from the physical world being solely the
purveyance of nature. Even when the individual left his house he was
still deep within a massive concentration of extra-natural,
human-exclusive activity.
</span>. Here again is Emily Brontë, her epic <i>The
night is darkening round me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The night is darkening round me,<br>
The wild winds coldly blow;<br>
But a tyrant spell has bound me,<br>
And I cannot, cannot go.<br>
<br>
The giant trees are bending<br>
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;<br>
The storm is fast descending,<br>
And yet I cannot go.<br>
<br>
Clouds beyond clouds above me,<br>
Wastes beyond wastes below;<br>
But nothing drear can move me;<br>
I will not, cannot go.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Yes, she refers to the outdoors. She even refers to the wilds as
&ldquo;wastes&rdquo;<label id='fnr.34' for='fnr-in.34.8147625' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.34.8147625' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup>
In those days wild, untouched places were often referred to as
wastelands.
</span> and as drear. And yet she is transfixed, frozen to the
spot&#x2014;and I cannot, cannot go, as she says. Subjective terms like
wastes and drear remind of the age-old attitude towards nature as a
terrible, grim, inescapable master, a sponsor of disaster and death,
hardly over which to wax poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that,
and to be sure, sublimely. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and
stared directly into an enemy previously known as all-powerful and
unforgiving, and in so doing she sensed something deep and found
sublimity evoked. Then she brought to us in her lines of poetry a new
way of being more human<label id='fnr.35' for='fnr-in.35.4122366' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.35.4122366' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup>
Contrast this inescapable nature back then with Hemingway&rsquo;s
twentieth-century nature. Sure, he went to relatively remote places to
play the macho man. But if anything serious happened he could always
have been airlifted out to receive modern medical care. The Romantic
Era poets&#x2014;whom he thought effete and sappy&#x2014;were in nature always
with no timeouts, no escape. Would Hemingway done all those macho-man
things if he had had no backdoor or exit if things went wrong?
</span>.
</p>

<p>
With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, with
death going on all around, the last two components, deterioration and
death, must be understood beyond our mechanistic reductionist modern
take of just physical breakage and malfunction<label id='fnr.36' for='fnr-in.36.6213328' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.36.6213328' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup>
Couple this &ldquo;death as malfunction&rdquo; with atheist nihilism for a
completely soulless mechanical universe realism dumpster fire.
</span>. Especially
death become Death, back in the day a quasi-spiritual <i>force
majeure</i>. But no, deterioration and death aren&rsquo;t what they used to
be. It&rsquo;s almost as if they were cordoned off&#x2014;or at least under much
greater human control than ever before. <i>It&rsquo;s as if through modern
medicine we have begun to acquire a demi-godlike, proto-immortal veto
power over physical demise.</i> And with this control we have torn down,
dismantled a great component of spirituality, namely the reckoning of
one&rsquo;s mortality with a deity. Where once was supposed a mortal,
physical plane inferior an immortal, spiritual plane, we now would look
only to the physical plane as exclusive. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Though for the meantime death remains an undeniable certainty. Death
comes as it always has&#x2014;from old age, fatal accident, or from deadly
physical aggression or predation<label id='fnr.37' for='fnr-in.37.4875638' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.37.4875638' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup>
For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are&#x2014;outside of war and homicidal aggression&#x2014;all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.
</span>. But a completely different
attitude arises when modern healthcare&rsquo;s labyrinth of diagnoses,
drugs, procedures and surgeries routinely thwart what was once all but
certain, eventual demise. And so we&rsquo;ve begun to lessen the mystery of
Death, overturn fate and doom.
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<br>
&#x2014; Psalm 90:10<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalistic,
absolute inevitability so resounding as to constantly shake and echo
through life. Death as life&rsquo;s backstop, container, timer, combinator,
reaper<label id='fnr.38' for='fnr-in.38.4030850' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.38.4030850' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup>
Consider <a href="https://youtu.be/SMNGhPgCKzw?si=L4HFHQuUTnP3j8I6">this goth version</a> of the classic rock song. Had this
been written in Brontëan times, it would have been no cheap,
sentimental gimmick.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
What then if we start to take command of death&rsquo;s agenda, rerouting
death&rsquo;s comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is making the point that by no
means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty years of life, and even if
we get them they might not be that great. And yet we have grown to
<i>expect</i> from the implicit promises of modern medical science a
healthy, quality seventy, eighty, ninety, or even more years. And so
modern medicine has disrupted the two last components of a nature
ubiquitous cyclic, i.e., deterioration and death. Modern science has
lessened the wallop of tragedy, weakened overall the doominess of doom
by redefining life as so much organic machine circuitry, a mechanism
that, in turn, is to be better and better repaired, maintained,
improved against entropic wear-and-tear<label id='fnr.39' for='fnr-in.39.5888636' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.39.5888636' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup>
Consider the commonplace heart pacemaker, a device that
literally commands the human heart with artificial electronic pulses.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Let me relate a modern story to our new attitude towards death. My
father, who has since passed away, lost his <i>third</i> wife to lung
cancer caused inevitably by decades of smoking<label id='fnr.40' for='fnr-in.40.893959' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>40</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.40.893959' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>40</sup>
Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.
</span>. But instead of
accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I finally theorised that he
had explicated from all the buzz of the various possible medical
interventions&#x2014;including their probabilities of success or
failure&#x2014;a hope that the death sentence of lung cancer could,
<i>should</i> be beaten by some technology lurking in some corner of the
modern medical labyrinth. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed death&rsquo;s arrival to
such an absurd degree. Human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of death able to lap over at any time. But today
the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has all but become an
expectation of, a guaranteed minimum&#x2014;even to the extent that old age
and death are increasingly spoken of as &ldquo;diseases&rdquo; we can and should
defeat. Death as a nuisance, indeed. My father felt cheated when that
three-, fourscore and more was not forthcoming. But as you may
anticipate, I contend life is life only with death&#x2014;death absolute
and not easily theorised away. God must be somewhere in all this.

<p>
Alas, but here is where I become quite the iconoclast, primarily by
insisting <i>nearly everyone has got Romanticism wrong!</i> Even the actual
contemporaries around Novalis. Perhaps even Novalis himself! I posit
that Novalis with his foundational HTTN took off in a straight line
into the Dark Muse<label id='fnr.47' for='fnr-in.47.768281' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>47</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.47.768281' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>47</sup>
Soon will be discussed things dark from the eighteenth
century.
</span>. Just reading HTTN, one cannot escape the
sheer intensity of Novalis&rsquo; swoon-fest over Night and
Death<label id='fnr.48' for='fnr-in.48.3259718' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>48</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.48.3259718' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>48</sup>
Try <a href="https://www.george-macdonald.com/etexts/hymns_to_night.html">this George MacDonald translation</a> as found in a
publication from 1897. Amazing how obscure unknown the keynote address
to the whole Romanticism convention has been. I&rsquo;ll try at a better,
annotated version soon.
</span>. Here&rsquo;s a small taste
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I feel the flow of<br>
Death&rsquo;s youth-giving flood;<br>
To balsam and æther, it<br>
Changes my blood!<br>
I live all the daytime<br>
In faith and in might:<br>
And in holy rapture<br>
I die every night.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
and just before
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
What delight, what pleasure offers <i>thy</i> life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night? Thy mother, it is she brings thee forth, and to her thou owest all thy glory.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
In my humble opinion, HTTN is one of the densest, purest attesting to
the Dark Muse ever. As the legend tells, his inspiration came from
being grief-stricken at the death of his fifteen-year-old fiancée
Sophie von Kühn, to whose grave he pilgrimed for one hundred
nights. The Jena Set writer Ludwig Tieck
described the teenage Sophie as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Even as a child, she gave an impression which&#x2014;because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely&#x2014;we must call super-earthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
HTTN is trance, vision, most certainly not just the gymnastics of
flipping the sacred to profane and profane to sacred as Novalis
himself once described Romanticism. He journeyed
into dark and came back with some of the purest dark ever.

<h3 id="org8258019">John Keats&rsquo; sense of Beauty</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8258019">
<p>
Samuel Taylor Coleridge is generally accepted as the leading
intellectualiser of Romanticism during its inception in
Britain. Following is a Coleridge quote as good as any
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each
other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the
accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as
the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible
directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces
should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike
indestructible&#x2026; this one power with its two inherent indestructible
yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which
their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and
the process of our own self-consciousness.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, wordy intellectualisations are the usual approach for academics
scrounging for copy. Then contrast this with what the English poet
John Keats said in a 1817 letter to his brothers George and Thomas
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being
in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching
after fact and reason&#x2014;Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine
isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from
being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued
through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with
a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration,
or rather obliterates all consideration.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Intellectualisations, great and lengthy, especially of the
&ldquo;Penetralium<label id='fnr.49' for='fnr-in.49.7314257' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.49.7314257' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup>
<b>penetralium</b>: (plural <i>penetralia</i>) the innermost (or most
secret) part of a building; an inner sanctum; a sanctum sanctorum.

<b>verisimilar</b>: having the appearance of truth.
</span>
ramblings that get us nowhere, Keats is saying. But with a simple ode
to Beauty the poet obviates, obliterates intellectualisations. Keats&rsquo;
<i>Negative Capability</i> is about <i>cognitive dissonance</i> as a great and
necessary burden the poet must carry, a process necessary for deeper
understanding beyond neat and tidy piles of logical-seeming
words. That is, to <i>not</i> immediately intellectualise, but to hold
oneself in a counter-intuitive state of unresolved&#x2014;just to see where
it might lead. Here is the famed beginning of his &ldquo;poetic romance&rdquo;
<i>Endymion</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:<br>
Its loveliness increases; it will never<br>
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep<br>
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep<br>
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.<br>
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing<br>
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,<br>
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth<br>
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,<br>
Of all the unhealthy and o&rsquo;er-darkened ways<br>
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,<br>
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall<br>
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,<br>
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon<br>
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils<br>
With the green world they live in; and clear rills<br>
That for themselves a cooling covert make<br>
&rsquo;Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,<br>
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:<br>
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms<br>
We have imagined for the mighty dead;<br>
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:<br>
An endless fountain of immortal drink,<br>
Pouring unto us from the heaven&rsquo;s brink.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Take that Coleridge, you brachial babbling braincase!
</p>

<p>
In the 2009 film <i>Bright Star</i>, a touching bio-drama about
Keats, there is a scene where, speaking with his love interest Fanny
Brawne, he says <i>A poet is not at all poetical. In fact, he the most
unpoetical thing in existence. He has no identity. He is continually
filling some other body&#x2014;the sun, the moon.</i> He then says, <i>Poetic
craft is a carcass, a sham. If poetry does not come as naturally as
leaves to a tree then it had better not come at all.</i> And then Fanny
says, <i>I still don&rsquo;t know how to work out a poem.</i> To which Keats
says,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving
in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the
lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not <i>work</i> the
lake out. It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and
emboldens the soul to accept mystery.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And thus, I would posit he, like I, did not see Romanticism as
something needs bundling and explaining and stuck with labels and
herded into categories. Time and time again I listen to or read a
description of Romanticism and come away with the feeling the author
understands nothing, rather, is simply stringing disparate bits and
bobs together for some logical consistency. And so I say the
intellectual prison yard in which academe has stuck Romanticism should
be opened up, the guards soundly switched and run off, the prisoners
let back out into the wide fields and deep woods.

<i>The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature&rsquo;s Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work</i> by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.
</span> author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to <i>thrive</i>, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, but wait,
haven&rsquo;t these bats jumped <i>outside</i> of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of <i>trans</i>-bat-ism. But is that a good thing?
In the meantime the bats profit. But for nature as a whole? In effect,
the bats have short-circuited their doom, their fate. And what are the
consequences?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps bats doing better is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis
the rest of their competitors and surrounding environment<label id='fnr.52' for='fnr-in.52.1262755' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>52</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.52.1262755' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>52</sup>
Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven&rsquo;t noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats&rsquo; primary food sources.
</span>. And
yet what happens when a species keeps thriving more and more,
increasing its success statistics, stepping over, beyond any of the
natural restrictions that real integration and harmony with nature
would have required? <b>Aren&rsquo;t we humans Exhibit A of just such an
out-of-control species?</b> And so I ask, how can all this so-called
thriving be good, end well?  How can a dominant species like ours,
which seems to be always &ldquo;gaming the system,&rdquo; evermore ingeniously and
aggressively extra-natural, not eventually have to pay some price?
Simply put, How can more and more people consuming more and more
resources and energy, each of us fantasising about success and
prosperity, not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?
</p>

<p>
Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to its tightly integrated niche, then
exponential growth ensues&#x2014;which will eventually hit an inflexion
point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards an
inevitable overshoot and crash.
</p>

<p>
To my mind, Emily Brontë was just this sort of hard-pressed little bat
out in the wilds&#x2014;colony-less, huddled in a hollow tree, barely eking
out a marginal life. Here is her <i>Plead for me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Why I have persevered to shun<br>
The common paths that others run;<br>
And on a strange road journeyed on<br>
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—<br>
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.<br>
<br>
These once indeed seemed Beings divine,<br>
And they perchance heard vows of mine<br>
And saw my offerings on their shrine—<br>
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,<br>
And mine were worthily despised;<br>
<br>
My Darling Pain that wounds and sears<br>
And wrings a blessing out from tears<br>
By deadening me to real cares;<br>
And yet, a king&#x2014;though prudence well<br>
Have taught thy subject to rebel.<br>
<br>
And am I wrong to worship where<br>
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,<br>
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?<br>
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me<br>
And tell why I have chosen thee!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I consider this her ode to skipping the trans-human thrive scene of
her day and striking out into some Beyond to commune with her God of
Visions. Again, I must believe she was a little bat fluttering across
the semi-wilderness moorland, as true an existential <i>underdog</i> as was
still possible back then<label id='fnr.53' for='fnr-in.53.5307921' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>53</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.53.5307921' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>53</sup>
Compare with today&rsquo;s outdoor adventurer with technical gear
from REI, Patagonia, North Face, driving to government set-aside wilds
in a four-wheel-drive Jeep Cherokee, consuming protein bars and
electrolyte drinks, listening to music with earbuds, taking smart
phone pictures and GoPro videos. Any mishaps? Call for immediate
helicopter rescue on a satellite connection&#x2026; At some point we&rsquo;re
just amateur Earth astronauts, no? When nature is in balance, all
participants are underdogs to some degree.
</span>. Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced
malnutrition, contaminated water, tuberculosis &#x2014; pick one, two, or
all three&#x2014;five months after her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the
greater world outside of her tiny Haworth village and its surrounding
hills for a few months<label id='fnr.54' for='fnr-in.54.2709316' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>54</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.54.2709316' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>54</sup>
A stay in Belgium to learn French and a short-lived gig in
nearby Halifax as a governess.
</span>. Hers was a world with nothing modern as
we know it, e.g., a cut on a toe could lead to an infection requiring
amputation, or even worse.
</p>

<p>
And yet one might ask if her existence in the early nineteen century
was really so very wild and rugged. Was she still not observing nature
from civilization&rsquo;s relative place of safety, thereby rendering her
observations just as tainted, just as relative as ours today? I say
no. Clearly our modern place of safety is maximal, as we of the
twenty-first century float above cruel Nature on unprecedented levels
of modern high-tech materialism<label id='fnr.55' for='fnr-in.55.9128117' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>55</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.55.9128117' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>55</sup>
We consume one hundred times the resources and energy per
capita as one of our European ancestors from 1800.
</span>. Nonetheless, I contend hers
was a unique vantage point, neither too exposed nor removed
from elemental nature.
</p>

<p>
So often I am confronted with modern scoffers who would have us
believe Romantic Era poets only knew nature from picnics held at
garden-like country estates where dandies and their pampered ladies
were attended by servants, as seen in the Hollywood film version of
Jane Austen&rsquo;s <i>Emma</i>
</p>

<img src="./images/EmmaPicnic2.png" width="770" alt="Emma picnic">
<span class="cap"><b>Emma</b> picnic in the harrowing wilds of England</span>

<p>
or playful romps like Hollywood&rsquo;s latest anachronistic redo of Emily
Brontë depicting her rolling down a grassy slope in some domesticated
country setting
</p>

<span class="cap">Fictional E.B. in a silly, carefree moment tumbling down a hill</b><br>(From the 2022 film <b>Emily</b>) </span>

<p>
Again, for us moderns nature is a <i>place</i>, a <i>location</i> away from and
diametrically opposite our modern interior spaces. Nature today is
seen as this vast other place, the <i>Great Outdoors</i>. Then the farther
afield from modern civilization we can go, the truer and more
authentic nature supposedly becomes. And so we create a <i>nature
continuum</i> whereby a trackless wilderness as far from civilization as
possible is the truest nature, while hardly nature at all would be a
ditch overgrown with weeds behind one of our triple-paned windowed,
vinyl-siding-clad, forced-air-HVAC suburban houses. Nature can only be
very wild, thus, very far away from the safety of space colony
civilization. Writers like Ernest Hemingway and Jack London exploit
these fright memes of nature as a distant, exotic, hostile
place. Which is virtually identical to science fiction stories of
hostile alien planets &ldquo;conquered&rdquo; by brave, intrepid astronauts. To be
sure, many sci-fi depictions of alien worlds are simply off-Earth
versions of the Klondike Yukon that London described.
</p>

<p>
No, my poets of the so-called Romantic Era were not pampered dandies
and fine ladies strolling for a few odd bored minutes on manicured
estate grounds. Nor were they any sort of beneficiaries of the &ldquo;Age of
Exploration&rdquo; colonialism. My poets were mainly short-lived little bats
in their crevasses and corners, as beaten and confused as any bats
have ever been.

spins out darkness and doom. To be sure, he is dark with a shudder,
full of fright memes meant to weigh down and ultimately defeat&#x2014;if

<p>
Of course every student of the Dark Muse should read Young&rsquo;s
<i>Night-thoughts</i>. And yet this over-the-top doom hyperbole eventually
delivers even the most indulgent reader to incredulity. At some point
it becomes farce, as when we might tell ghost stories at a social
gathering quite dramatic convincing, but then returning to
rationality, not take them seriously. Though Graveyard had a lighter
side. For example, Thomas Gray&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44299/elegy-written-in-a-country-churchyard">Elegy Written in a Country
Churchyard</a></i> (1751). To be sure, the eulogising of the dead is a much
older and well established genre, typically emphasising the qualities
of the deceased over the dark abyss his grave might represent. While
we&rsquo;re not meant to survive Young&rsquo;s world, Gray&rsquo;s elegy of a lost
friend is dark and fatalist and yet reverent faithful
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,<br>
Heav&rsquo;n did a recompense as largely send:<br>
He gave to Mis&rsquo;ry all he had, a tear,<br>

<p>
Here whatever negatives, sinister, morose, and doomy, may be swirling
about, God in his heavenly domain has our backs. We may obsess wallow
in the fatalism of mortal inevitabilities, but Gray doesn&rsquo;t try to
beat us down as much as did the hardcore Graveyard Schoolers. And yet
with Graveyard Britain had arrived at a public exhibition of dark. At
some point we must ask (setting aside the amateur historical
social-psychology of academe), <b>Is dark innate?</b> Again I ask, <b>Is dark
nature or nurture?</b> In my humble opinion, a great movement like
Graveyard arrives unexpected, completely out of the blue, a natural,
organic collective upwelling. Which begs the question, What rises to
cultural and intellectual prominence in an age?<label id='fnr.60' for='fnr-in.60.4047004' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>60</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.60.4047004' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>60</sup>
&#x2026;that is, in an past age not exposed to the science of
modern public relations. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">this</a> about Edward Bernays and the birth
of modern advertising and public relations. TL;DR: Since Bernays, no
&ldquo;movement&rdquo; can be considered natural and organic.
</span> Obviously,
there must be a foundation of social cohesion and integrity, a
predominance of high cultural standards for a trend to be more than
just what we see today, i.e., cultural hooliganism and opportunist,
lowest-common-denominator pablum. To be sure, many of that era
condemned gothic and Graveyard as subculture. But eventually came
refinement, which I might call the <i>Night School</i>. Though intervening
was the <i>gothic novel</i> .

Prose versus poetry. In the past poetry was seen in polite upper-class
circles as the higher, the preferred, acceptable form of
literature<label id='fnr.61' for='fnr-in.61.2682680' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>61</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.61.2682680' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>61</sup>
For example, Germany has long been referred to as the land of
<i>poets</i> and <i>thinkers</i> (<i>Das Land der Dichter und
Denker</i>). Intentionally absent is novelists. Although now novelists
count as part of <i>die Belletristik</i>, i.e., <i>schöngeistige Literatur</i>
or aesthetic literature.
</span>. Prose in the form of the novel<label id='fnr.62' for='fnr-in.62.474339' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>62</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.62.474339' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>62</sup>
Two terms, <i>novel</i> (English) and <i>roman</i> (French, German,
etc. from the adjectival <i>Roman</i>, <i>Roman-like</i>) came to describe any
long-form prose story-telling.
</span>, on the other
hand, was not acceptable, seen as too revealing invasive personal,
i.e., it is improper, unseemly, distasteful to expose even an
imaginary person&rsquo;s life details in such an open and revealing
fashion. According to this attitude, it was a crude thing to so freely
fantasise human goings-on in a fictitious way. Rather, literature must
ennoble the human as a being created in the likeness of God, and not
dwell on his mundanity and failings. After all, a novel was neither
factual (e.g. a saint&rsquo;s hagiography) nor high lyrical poetic (e.g.,
church hymn lyrics or <i>Heldenlieder</i>). A novel/roman was simply too
plain-spoken, i.e., the unavoidable clarity (<i>Klartext</i>) inherent in
non-poeticised descriptive writing invariably generated an undesirable
ordinariness. And so it was in this mise en scène that the prose novel
bumped along post-Medieval Age as a barely tolerated corruption of
writing, as a regrettable parallel to poetry, consumed mainly by
easily excited arriviste vulgarian middle-class women. And yet as the
middle class grew in power and numbers, the novel came to
the fore, especially in the eighteenth century.<label id='fnr.63' for='fnr-in.63.1106891' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>63</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.63.1106891' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>63</sup>
Ironically, the <i>Novella</i>, a long short-story format with no
chapter breaks, was seemingly better tolerated in Germany.

</p>

<p>
Modern academe considers the novel <i>The Castle of Otranto, A Gothic
Story</i>, appearing in its first edition in 1764, to be the official
start of British <i>gothic</i> literature.<label id='fnr.64' for='fnr-in.64.9636768' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>64</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.64.9636768' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>64</sup>
One giveaway is <i>gothic</i> in the title. Perhaps read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction">this
overview</a> of Gothic fiction.
</span> Written by the excentric,
iconoclastic English nobleman Horace Walpole (1717 – 1797), <i>Otranto</i>
is a melodrama set in sixteenth-century Naples offering the
impressionable middle-class women of the day a big dose of darkness,
doom, and woe. Walpole&rsquo;s penchant for medievalism rode the always
simmering nostalgic idealisation of the Medieval Age<label id='fnr.65' for='fnr-in.65.7900760' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>65</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.65.7900760' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>65</sup>
Walpole initially claimed <i>Otranto</i> to be a medieval
manuscript he had discovered and translated when it was completely his
own creation all along.
</span>, while the
adjective <i>gothic</i> referred to medieval Gothic architecture.<label id='fnr.66' for='fnr-in.66.9614924' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>66</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.66.9614924' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>66</sup>
&#x2026;although this is ironic since the actual label Gothic had
been used pejoratively in the Renaissance alluding to the
destructive barbarian Goths.
</span>
Gothic &ldquo;horror&rdquo; was an instant hit, and other writers and influencers
quickly joined in creating a full-on dark movement.<label id='fnr.67' for='fnr-in.67.7120933' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>67</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.67.7120933' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>67</sup>
The popularity of the gothic novel continued throughout the
nineteenth and into the twentieth century primarily in the Romance
genre. Among others, Frances Parkinson Keyes was a popular romance
author who often wrote from a gothic perspective. <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonwyck_(film)">Dragonwyck</a></i> (1946)
is a prime example of Hollywood does gothic romance. Once asked why
his horror films were so popular, Alfred Hitchcock said the man on the
street likes to dip his toe in the lake of horror occasionally.

<span class="cap">Wolf's Crag from Walter Scott's gothic <i>The Bride of Lammermore</i> </span>

<p>
Above is an etching from a publication of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_of_Lammermoor">The
Bride of Lammermore</a></i> (1819). Consider the sheer visual density and
heaviness of the scene (click on the image to be taken to a larger
version). Whence, wherefore this heaviness, this portent?  Predominant
is nature dark, inhospitable, and threatening, the human-built castle
primitive, isolated, and vulnerable, the riders miniscule, exposed. It
is as if every single living cell&#x2014;plant, animal, human&#x2014;is clinging
to life by a thread, and any dim green and blue hues of vegetation and
sea are wholly irrelevant. The scene evokes threat, danger, dysphoria,
something horrific just waiting to transpire. But again how, why? Why
such darkness and what was (and still is) the appeal? Hitchcock
tautologies aside, modern academe has offered theories about the
socio-political-psychological landscape of the times, and yet these
&ldquo;experts&rdquo; only wind up sounding supercilious and patronising from
their modern triumphalist perches, as if they are searching for a
disease to explain a malady, weakness to explain indulgence. No,
indeed, dark, even when crude and heavy, predominates, arrests,
mystifies, the appeal all the stronger for its recessive, ungraspable
spherical symmetry. To be sure, this &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; of gothic in the
eighteenth century was overwrought, overweight with its fright memes,
but undeniably popular and onto something real about the inner human
experience.

<h4 id="orgc7eb2b3">The night, the stars the moon&#x2026;</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc7eb2b3">
<p>
As assuredly personal and original as Novalis&rsquo; <i>Hymns to the Night</i>
was, Englishwoman Anna Laetitia Barbauld&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_(Barbauld)/A_Summer_Evening%27s_Meditation">A Summer Evening&rsquo;s
Meditation</a></i> had already appeared in 1773 praising the night in a
similarly cherished, solemn way. Without deeper investigation I have
no real idea if Barbauld&rsquo;s <i>Meditation</i> started what I&rsquo;m calling the
<i>Night School</i>, but as a working theory, yes, she offered a new
perspective to dark with an accessibility and maturity not seen in
Graveyard or gothic horror. After a nod to Young&rsquo;s <i>Night-thoughts</i>
with a quote therefrom, <i>One sun by day, by night ten thousand shine</i>,
Barbauld launches directly into her summer night and its canopy of
stars&#x2026;
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Tis past! The sultry tyrant of the south<br>
Has spent his short-liv&rsquo;d rage; more grateful hours<br>
Move silent on; the skies no more repel<br>
The dazzled sight, but with mild maiden beams<br>
Of temper&rsquo;d light, invite the cherish&rsquo;d eye<br>
To wander o&rsquo;er their sphere; where hung aloft<br>
Dian&rsquo;s bright crescent, like a silver bow<br>
New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns<br>
Impatient for the night, and seems to push<br>
Her brother down the sky. Fair Venus shines<br>
E&rsquo;en in the eye of day; with sweetest beam<br>
Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood<br>
Of soften&rsquo;d radiance from her dewy locks.<br>
The shadows spread apace; while meeken&rsquo;d Eve<br>
Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires<br>
Thro&rsquo; the Hesperian gardens of the west,<br>
And shuts the gates of day. &rsquo;Tis now the hour<br>
When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
No woe, no gloom-and-doom, rather, a relentless parade of visceral and
natural dark hyperconductivity. Barbauld hauls us outdoors to partake,
imbibe, behold. We are not obsessing on doom, rather, we are touched,
moved to reflect in reverence&#x2014;
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;But are they silent all? or is there not<br>
A tongue in every star that talks with man,<br>
And wooes him to be wife; nor wooes in vain:<br>
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,<br>
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.<br>
At this still hour the self-collected soul<br>
Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there<br>
Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;<br>
An embryo God; a spark of fire divine,<br>
Which must burn on for ages, when the sun,<br>
(Fair transitory creature of a day!)<br>
Has clos&rsquo;d his golden eye, and wrap&rsquo;d in shades<br>
Forgets his wonted journey thro&rsquo; the east.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Night over day.<label id='fnr.68' for='fnr-in.68.1907830' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>68</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.68.1907830' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>68</sup>
And here&rsquo;s some of my own doggerel, <i>From a Grandniece To Her
Great-aunt At Her Great-uncle’s Funeral</i>: <br>
  You see, dear Auntie, <br>
  Day is all supposes, <br>
  Night but only a few. <br>
  Night quietly closes <br>
  Day’s great to-do. <br>
  Lost on the Day, <br>
  I wait for deepest Night, <br>
  for Darkness and I must <br>
  Decline clamant Light. <br>
<br>
</span> Night a more expansive, passive, more nuanced
interim inviting deeper, more mature human introspection. Far distant,
cool and gentle are the myriad stars, unlike our single oversized and
often ruinous local star of day.
</p>

<p>
I mean to say this is my kind of dark, i.e., free of any campy fright
devices. Most assuredly every protégé of the Dark Muse must read
Barbauld&rsquo;s lengthy masterpiece. Hers is an exposition of natural
darkness, placing it far above the reproach of gothic horror
detractors. Though <i>Meditation</i> was no doubt a singleton, a unicorn
whose influence seemed to lay dormant for decades.<label id='fnr.69' for='fnr-in.69.4756222' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>69</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.69.4756222' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>69</sup>
&#x2026;although Wordsworth would later mention Barbauld and
<i>Meditation</i> as inspirational.
</span> One Barbauld
biographer mentioned a trend of that time of ladies studying
astronomy. But obviously Barbauld is waxing dark, not repeating facts
about celestial bodies. Perusing her other poems, yes, she dwells on
nature, sometimes in a dusky way, but addressing dark as she did with
<i>Meditation</i> never again appeared so directly during her times. Today
she is known as an influential social commentator, moralist, and
educator, not as proto-Romantic. And so I must jump ahead some fifty
years and bring in Brontëan poetry as a continuation of this Night
School thread. Haworth Emily&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Poems_of_Emily_Bront%C3%AB/Stars">Stars</a></i> is just one her many examples
of Night School from someone who probably had never read nor heard of
Barbauld&rsquo;s <i>Meditation</i>. Exactly like Barbauld, in <i>Stars</i> Haworth
Emily lauds the night and its starry sky
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Thought followed thought, star followed star<br>
Through boundless regions, on;<br>
While one sweet influence, near and far,<br>
Thrilled through, and proved us one!<br>
<br>
Why did the morning dawn to break<br>
So great, so pure, a spell;<br>
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,<br>
Where your cool radiance fell?<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
The night sky&rsquo;s depth and expanse over the trammels of life during
sunlight, indeed. And so the last two stanzas
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night;<br>
Oh, night and stars, return!<br>
And hide me from the hostile light<br>
That does not warm, but burn;<br>
<br>
That drains the blood of suffering men;<br>
Drinks tears, instead of dew;<br>
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,<br>
And only wake with you!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Night School redeems dark by pulling it out of the ostentatiousness,
the gimmickry of Graveyard and gothic. Started by Barbauld, it was
independently embraced by others. Let&rsquo;s look at sister Anne Brontë&rsquo;s
<i>Night</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I love the silent hour of night,<br>
For blissful dreams may then arise,<br>
Revealing to my charmed sight<br>
What may not bless my waking eyes.<br>
<br>
And then a voice may meet my ear,<br>
That death has silenced long ago;<br>
And hope and rapture may appear<br>
Instead of solitude and woe.<br>
<br>
Cold in the grave for years has lain<br>
The form it was my bliss to see;<br>
And only dreams can bring again,<br>
The darling of my heart to me.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Simpler, more measured was Anne&rsquo;s poetry than her sister&rsquo;s. And she
includes the grave by eulogising either of her older sisters Maria or
Elizabeth, or her mother, but again, sans drama.
</p>

<p>
This calmer, more introspective dark dominated the eighteenth
century. And let us not forget the many poems devoted to the
moon. Here is Anne&rsquo;s <i>Fluctuations</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
What though the Sun had left my sky;<br>
To save me from despair<br>
The blessed Moon arose on high,<br>
And shone serenely there.<br>
<br>
I watched her, with a tearful gaze,<br>
Rise slowly o&rsquo;er the hill,<br>
While through the dim horizon&rsquo;s haze<br>
Her light gleamed faint and chill.<br>
<br>
I thought such wan and lifeless beams<br>
Could ne&rsquo;er my heart repay<br>
For the bright sun&rsquo;s most transient gleams<br>
That cheered me through the day:<br>
<br>
But, as above that mist&rsquo;s control<br>
She rose, and brighter shone,<br>
I felt her light upon my soul;<br>
But now—that light is gone!<br>
<br>
Thick vapours snatched her from my sight,<br>
And I was darkling left,<br>
All in the cold and gloomy night,<br>
Of light and hope bereft:<br>
<br>
Until, methought, a little star<br>
Shone forth with trembling ray,<br>
To cheer me with its light afar—<br>
But that, too, passed away.<br>
<br>
Anon, an earthly meteor blazed<br>
The gloomy darkness through;<br>
I smiled, yet trembled while I gazed—<br>
But that soon vanished too!<br>
<br>
And darker, drearier fell the night<br>
Upon my spirit then;—<br>
But what is that faint struggling light?<br>
Is it the Moon again?<br>
<br>
Kind Heaven! increase that silvery gleam<br>
And bid these clouds depart,<br>
And let her soft celestial beam<br>
Restore my fainting heart!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Here we may imagine the youngest Brontë bowed if not weighed down by
her earthly afflictions, cares, deprivations, but then in this lean,
hungry, susceptible state caught in an emotional whirling, carried,
borne up by the natural nighttime procession of sun to moon and
stars. She speaks of her tearful gaze, her fainting heart, her
spirits, her emotional exposure. She is a vulnerable ward of nature,
but tenaciously pursuant of its subtleties. Indeed, back then it was
always subtleties, delicate qualities found in nature by the
vulnerable if not pathetic human, an exacting counting of seemingly
modest blessings which then gained sublime ascendency.
</p>

<p>
If I wasn&rsquo;t pledged to Emily, I might say Anne has an even finer take
on dark than her older sister. I might dare to say Anne&rsquo;s Christianity
is more conventional, whereas Emily with her obvious
thought-behind-thoughts mental state took a starker, more fatalist view of
God. Anne humble, Emily defiant perhaps; <b>nevertheless, the Dark Muse
absolutely owned by these Brontës!</b>
</p>

<p>
Just for some balance, let me mention another Night Schooler, namely,
the Swiss poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Keller">Gottfried Keller</a>. Again, he is even later by some
three or four decades than the Brontës. Here is his <i>Winternacht</i> or
<i>Winter Night</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Not a wingbeat went through the world;<br>
silent and brilliant lay the white snow.<br>
Not a puff of cloud hung in the starry canopy,<br>
no wave surged in the torpid lake.<br>
<br>
From the depths climbed a lake-tree,<br>
to its crown encased in ice;<br>
and upon its branches climbed the water nymph,<br>
gazing up through the green ice.<br>
<br>
There I stood upon the thin glass<br>
that separated me from the black depths;<br>
Close beneath my feet I saw<br>
her white beauty, limb for limb.<br>
<br>
With smothered sorrow she groped<br>
here and there on the hard barrier.<br>
Never will I will forget her dark expression;<br>
always, always, shall it remain in my mind!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
One of my favourites, I have always wondered what the man did with the
rest of his life. Did he return to the lake trying to find his water
nymph; or did he resign himself to his mortal and mundane life? In any
event, the mystery and allure of a forest in deep winter night is
undeniable. Such magic and mystery obviously could not have occurred
in daylight.
</p>

<p>
With Night School, first, nature is dark, then human reflection upon
that natural dark, i.e., no fake dark, no camp, no hyperbole. Just the
deepest possible descriptions of the world in darkness bringing forth
some of humanity&rsquo;s finest insights.

<h3 id="org84752f7">Romanticism</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org84752f7">
<p>
Another great hulking elephant in the middle of the room is
Romanticism. As I have not so subtly been hinting, what came to be
known as Romanticism is, to a large degree, the labeling work of the
herders, not the actual animals who never stopped to promote, package,
or label themselves. I&rsquo;m about the animals, not their herdsmen. And
yet it is difficult to separate the two. Pull up an artist, musician,
poet of that era (late eighteenth and throughout the nineteenth
centuries?)&#x2014;and along comes handlers, interpreters&#x2014;management,
&ldquo;suits.&rdquo; The self-awareness, the stewardship, in general, the
intentionality of Romanticism throughout the supposed Romantic period
is hard to ascertain. Was the Romantic Movement fully aware of itself
and acknowledged during its main fifty year duration (1800-1850)? Yes
and no: Yes the shepherds, the explainers talked it up (e.g., the Jena
Set, Coleridge, Emerson et al.), but no, the actual producers were
mostly self-absorbed unicorns.<label id='fnr.70' for='fnr-in.70.7279737' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>70</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.70.7279737' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>70</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., the Brontës were pastor&rsquo;s daughters in rural West
Yorkshire with little exposure to (taint from?) the cultural and
literary buzz of the cities.
</span> In any event, academe today has
all the facts and figures, all the categories and pigeonholes ready
for our consumption. Caveat emptor.<label id='fnr.71' for='fnr-in.71.2332334' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>71</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.71.2332334' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>71</sup>
One left-brain pedantic hot mess is the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0144q90/episodes/guide">BBC&rsquo;s series on
Romanticism</a>. (Catch it on YouTube under <i>The Romantics: <a href="https://youtu.be/oLwRXlSgiSQ?si=y4a1MQek8Ac0pkyJ">Liberty</a>,
<a href="https://youtu.be/liVQ21KZfOI?si=GpsPOUfS_l6w6r8_">Nature</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/R6mefXs5h9o?si=c-cJk0fKTneunPZH">Eternity</a>)</i>. And then Bertrand Russell in his <i>The History of
Western Philosophy</i> mangles away at it in his consummate left-brain
way.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And yet how could we not have the non-talented running up ahead to
claim they are explaining, if not leading the cat herd? Two men who
wore both hats, i.e., creator and explainer, were Samuel Taylor
Coleridge and Edgar Allan Poe. And it is exactly with them that we see
their creations take us into the ephemeral mists of Romanticism&rsquo;s
subtleties and sublimities, while their intellectualizations and
pontifications thereof sounded windy, if not shrill. No wonder the
concept of left-brain, right-brain arose, as nothing else can describe
this split-personality confusion. But the urban salons demanded
rational, left-brain talk and copy. I, however, must separate out the
chatter and focus on the subtle and sublime.

<h4 id="org0e5a331">English and German Romanticism</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0e5a331">
<p>
The first identifiable wave started just before and after the turn of
the nineteenth century. Coleridge and Wordsworth&rsquo;s collaboration
<i>Lyrical Ballads</i> appeared in 1798, in the final years of the
eighteenth century, free of any of the intentionality implied by
academe. Today a artistic or cultural trend becomes global in less
than a day.  But in the closing years of the eighteenth and the
beginning of the nineteenth century there seemed to be something in
the air. AndAnd yet around every creative principal a group of
advocates, analysts, and explainers seemed to spring up&#x2014;with many
&ldquo;verisimilitudes caught from the Penetralium of mystery,&rdquo; as Keats
chided Coleridge. If beauty is best not intellectualised, then that
further station, sublimity and its Penetralia, was not to be jawed
about and chewed upon either. Fazit: Romanticism as it has come down
to us is a list of producers with far less in common with one another
than their contemporary and later describers would have<label id='fnr.72' for='fnr-in.72.4627558' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>72</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.72.4627558' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>72</sup>
Again, my principle principal, Emily Brontë, arguably knew
very little to absolutely nothing about Jena, Novalis, or even much of
Coleridge and Wordsworth other than perhaps a reading of their
<i>Lyrical Ballads</i> (from 1798). Poe supposedly had encountered
translations of Ludwig Tieck&rsquo;s short stories. That is to say, the
principals were rarely that well studied of their like-minds.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Academe wants what is called <i>Early German Romanticism</i> to have begun
when Novalis&rsquo; HTTN burst upon the scene in the very first year of the
nineteenth century. Clear to me, however, is that HTTN was a unicorn
one-off that came out of the blue, thus, certainly not intentional,
positioned for, or tailored to any specific agenda<label id='fnr.73' for='fnr-in.73.6177271' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>73</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.73.6177271' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>73</sup>
Contrast this with Goethe&rsquo;s play <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Tauris_(Goethe)">Iphigenia in Tauris</a></i>, a
version of the Euripedes&rsquo; original which was specifically meant to be
a showcase example of Goethe&rsquo;s ideal of modern classicism, i.e., his
and Friedrich Schiller&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Classicism">Weimar Classicism</a>.
</span>. But the
so-called <i>Jena Set</i>, an intellectual salon centred around the
Schlegel brothers, August Wilhelm and Friedrich, along with August&rsquo;s
wife and &ldquo;den mother&rdquo; Caroline, seized upon the mostly absentee
Novalis as their boy wonder <i>Liebling</i> mascot&#x2014;and the conflation of
producers and describers began in earnest. joined later by Friedrich
Schelling An intense as the inner circle of the Jena Set in Jena,
Germany, arose right before the beginning of the eighteenth century to
promote . And just a year after HTTN appreared Novalis dies on
them. Novalis and HTTN then left the radar as the Schlegel brothers,
August Wilhelm and Friedrich, along with August&rsquo;s wife and &ldquo;den
mother&rdquo; Caroline, joined later by Friedrich Schelling sally forth to
create an entire mountain range of much brighter descriptions of what

<i>Magnificent Rebels</i> as Exhibit A of how the describers and explainers
just did not get it. Wulf&rsquo;s detailed description of the &ldquo;Jena Set&rdquo;
sounds similar to accounts of Andy Warhol&rsquo;s <i>Factory</i> and its bipolar
crowd.

Coleridge (sometimes as literal translation as in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographia_Literaria">Biographia
Literaria</a> - 1817) and eventually by Emerson and the
Transcendentalists in the Colonies. Any brightening of the ominous
tremendous HTTN is irksome, but if we stay loyal to dark, we may reach
further back to the English <i><a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/graveyard-school">Graveyard School</a></i> of the mid- and
late-eighteenth century.

</span> Unfortunately The Wikipedia description of
Dark Romantic trots out all the negative stereotypes of dark. But as
one biographer noted, Poe struggled all his short adult life to make a
living as a writer and poet. One supposed quote of his said “&#x2026; your
writer of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big pen,
with a very blunt nib.” However the American publishing world was
rarely supportive, as one historian said, eager to move on from dark
and gothic. And yet Poe always seemed to find audiences.

of age, Edgar Allen Poe was

wandering about clueless &#x2014; <i>seriously</i> clueless.

One of my earliest brushes with Dostoevski&rsquo;s <i>presence of eternal
harmoy</i> came to me on a Halloween night back when I was a little boy
in a small Southern Illinois town. We were trick-or-treating on our
street, the oldest neighborhood in town with Victorians, cobblestone,
and gas streetlights. At some point I felt like I had left the present
and entered another dimension, a nighttime fairy forest of bare
trees. Everything was magical, and yet as a child not yet disabused of
magic, I didn&rsquo;t think anything was too out of the ordinary. I
distinctly remember looking up into the dense, bare branches of a huge
old oak and seeing the moon looking in and out of crossing clouds and
feeling like I was a spirit entered another world. Tonight, I can see
this other world of shadow and magic as I look out at my
waning-moonlit <i>Inland Sea</i> over the treetops of dark spruce and
gnarled, bare aspen.
</p>

<p>
I live in the far-northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called North
Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, along the shore
before the Canadian border. This so-called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region">Arrowhead Region</a>&rdquo; holds
some three million-plus acres of wilderness on the shores of the
world&rsquo;s largest body (by surface area) of freshwater. And to my mind,
this is a very Dark Muse kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, I
cannot go. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but our dark vibe
here must be experienced to be really appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Though I&rsquo;m wont to call Lake Superior the <i>Inland Sea</i>, thus, North
Coast instead of North Shore. This is due to <i>her</i> being so much more
sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is something much
smaller and much friendlier. The Inland Sea is big and often violent
like any sea or ocean of saltwater. She&rsquo;s no simple lake for
beer-and-brats picnickers, windsurfers, speedboat and jet ski
riffraff<label id='fnr.76' for='fnr-in.76.3904119' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>76</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.76.3904119' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>76</sup>
Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her lasting more
than ten minutes can lead to hypothermia &#x2026; at least on the North
Coast. Wisconsin and Michigan beaches can be swimmable in the height
of summer.
</span>. <i>She</i> has a mighty présence, often dark and moody if
not threatening.
</p>

<p>
A deep moodiness prevails. Here is nothing really spectacular in the
sense of the Great Outdoors overwhelming with one postcard vista after
another&#x2014;as we think of the American West and Alaska. Rather, here is
a more subtlety, more reserve, more mood.
</p>

<p>
Though I feel quite alone here in this assessment. My little
village, Grand Marais, the county seat, is only some thirteen hundred
souls. And yet as the years go by we are becoming evermore
suburban-like in mentality. Being a popular Northern Midwest resort
town, We have a steady stream of newcomers who increasingly are not
adapting to small-town life; instead, maintaining their aloof,
disengaged, blinkered urban-suburban ways. So often one encounters
another supposed fellow human&#x2014;only to receive the &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t exist&rdquo;
treatment common on a street in Manhattan.
</p>

<p>
Another social-psychology pitfall is how many people came up from a
Chicago or especially Twin Cities suburb ostensibly to reinvent
themselves. They&rsquo;ve made the leap out of the sterile, soulless
clone-bunny suburbia to now be some new version of themselves. They
typically use Hemingway and Jack London, i.e., a macho attitude about
wilderness and what. I call this <i>Neo-Klondikism</i>.
</p>

<p>
Steger etc. totally different from the real pioneers of late 19th-,
early 20th-century who brought Victorian civilization to the
wilderness.
</p>

<p>
Grand Marais is my &ldquo;sepulchre by the sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Quietude and contemplation in a place far from civilization.
