<p>
The purpose of this media effort will be to convey some of my thoughts
and impressions about things <i>dark</i>, or as I call it, the <i>Dark
Muse</i><label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.6159227' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.6159227' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
<b>muse</b>: originally any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts, <i>or</i> a
state of deep thought or abstraction, <i>or</i> a source of
inspiration
</span>. This would hopefully include, be a superset of what is
known today as goth<label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.8234081' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.8234081' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
The modern &ldquo;goth subculture&rdquo; as perhaps described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture">here</a>. It&rsquo;s as
good as any&#x2026; Lots more about why goth seems to be allergic to Dark
Muse later.
</span> and gothic &#x2026; meaning I hope to go deeper
and more elemental than most modern takes on dark. And so I ask, Do
you have an inexplicable affinity for things a tad gloomy? Do you find
dreamy what they find dreary &#x2026; as when a cloudy day brings out a
strangely sanguine melancholy &#x2026; or a stormy night is frightening in
a wonderfully thrilling sort of way? Does twilight heighten your
senses <i>and</i> calm your nerves? Perhaps you&rsquo;ve paused to gaze
transfixed<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.5490130' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.5490130' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
Tragic is how many people today have desensitised themselves
from becoming transfixed, no?
</span> upon an old, overgrown cemetery, or a lonely,
nondescript countryside scene? And of course you&rsquo;re quickly maxed-out
on happy-clappy, sunny-cheery<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.5142223' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.5142223' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
I call it <i>boosterism</i>, i.e., those people who always seem to
be positive &#x2026; and get miffed when you&rsquo;re not going along with their
sunny-cheery everything&rsquo;s grand campaign!
</span>. You prefer candlelight over
artificial light, old architecture over new. And wouldn&rsquo;t it be great
if every month (or every week!) celebrated Halloween? If yes to any of
this, I&rsquo;m speaking to you.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s start with an example, a litmus test of sorts. I present here a
short, simple poem from my main darkness benefactress, the poet who
stands at the centre of everything I mean to say about dark&#x2014;one
Emily Jane Brontë! <label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.5754865' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.5754865' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
Oddly enough, I&rsquo;ve never read her <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and do
not intend to. However, her poetry I read continually, gleaning new
insights each time. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB">here</a> for a quick biography.
<br>
<img src="images/Emily_Brontë_by_Patrick_Branwell_Brontë_restored.jpg" alt="Emily_Brontë_by_Patrick_Branwell_Brontë_restored.jpg"> <br>
</span>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br>
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br>
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br>
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br>
I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br>
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Direct, blunt perhaps? But there it is: <i>You either get it or
you don&rsquo;t</i>. Either she is speaking to something in you&#x2014;or you are
immediately put off and find it &#x2014; <i>weird</i>, overwrought, reaching,
melodramatic, puerile, morbid, or even sick or evil.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m continually confronted by people who consider my penchant for dark
things morose, morbid, indicative of an unstable, labile mind, that is
to say, something that needs curing, fixing, at the very least
suppressing. But I must repudiate and stand my ground. I hearken back
to a time when everyone was a bit dark, namely the early nineteenth
century, a time when key poets (e.g. the Brontës) showed us how dark
goes to the core of life.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s try another poem. Here is Longfellow&rsquo;s <i>Snow-flakes</i> from a
collection published in 1863
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Out of the bosom of the Air,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,<br>
Over the woodlands brown and bare,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Over the harvest-fields forsaken,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Silent, and soft, and slow<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Descends the snow.<br>
<br>
Even as our cloudy fancies take<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Suddenly shape in some divine expression,<br>
Even as the troubled heart doth make<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In the white countenance confession,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The troubled sky reveals<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The grief it feels.<br>
<br>
This is the poem of the air,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Slowly in silent syllables recorded;<br>
This is the secret of despair,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Now whispered and revealed<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;To wood and field.<br>

</span>&#x2014;despair, grief, misery&#x2014;into more equanimous
states of sadness and melancholy by reaching out to the natural world
and <i>poetising</i><label id='fnr.8' for='fnr-in.8.2926799' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.8.2926799' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup>
The idea of poetising, the <i>poetisation</i> of nature and life was
central to the Romantic Movement. It parallels the long-standing
belief that we humans explain ourselves through, embed our lives in
narratives.
</span>. This looking to nature, so often in her darker
garb, and poetising was the modus operandi of my nineteenth-century
poet. As if they understood depression to be like a ravaging cancer or
virus that may eventually go into remission but can never be entirely
eliminated while on Earth. And yes, in some inexplicable way nature
and darkness are catalysts of this remission process. I contend we
have lost the ability to transform hardship and tragedy and the
ensuing depression into a stasis remission melancholy, to find a modus
vivendi<label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.1833281' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.1833281' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
<b>modus vivendi</b>: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, <i>or</i> (literally) a way of living.
</span> with the trials and tribulations of life. Surely the
human can never <i>learn</i> to suffer; humans must suffer poorly. And so
the viruses of a life too often calamitous can never go away, only
fade into the backdrop of time. In this regard I would say the
Romantic Era poets had a better grasp of life. First and foremost,
they faced and accepted doom and fate. They took the good and
especially the bad of life and used both to keep growing emotionally
and spiritually. When misfortune struck, they gave emotions free
reign. They did not <i>process</i> greif, greif <i>processed</i>
them<label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.9556618' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.9556618' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
Consider Queen Victoria who wore mourning black from the time
of her husband, Prince Albert&rsquo;s death in 1861 to the end of her life
in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg upon losing her husband
Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. No one chivvied them along with their grief.
</span>. The long, painful recovery from tragedy became a sort of
life-as-art form. They took life&rsquo;s slings and arrows, and with nature and
darkness and faith bound them, thereby transforming the inevitable
scarring into an exquisite though ironic sublimity<label id='fnr.11' for='fnr-in.11.7157837' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.11.7157837' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup>
Lots and lots more on <i>sublimity</i> as we go. I promise.
</span>&#x2014;like no
other generation before or since.
</p>

<p>
And yet the penchant for the Dark Muse remains a mystery. I cannot
deny I&rsquo;m often defenceless against the charge of <i>wallowing</i>&#x2014;in
grief, in dark morosity. Again, let&rsquo;s call it instinctual. The
fresh-cut rose elicits one response, but the dry, dessicated rose
another&#x2014;perhaps deeper. Let&rsquo;s see another example of &ldquo;you get the
Dark Muse or you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; this time from Emily Elizabeth
Dickinson<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.5268423' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.5268423' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>

<p>
Indeed. That last line includes <i>Death</i>, capitalised<label id='fnr.14' for='fnr-in.14.3189985' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.14.3189985' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup>
Dickinson often employed the German practice of capitalising
nouns for poetic emphasis.
</span>. Let me
again say these nineteenth-century artists understood death much
differently than we do today. I believe this capitalised, past century
view of Death has become opaque, lost, and in need of closer
investigation.

<i>The main points being:</i>
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No &ldquo;degrees&rdquo; of nature, rather, nature is ubiquitous</li>

<li>The increasingly extra-natural human</li>
</ul>

<p>
I hold that our modern, twenty-first-century understanding of nature
is very different than that of early-nineteenth-century poets such as
the Haworth and Amherst Emilies <label id='fnr.15' for='fnr-in.15.8304502' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.15.8304502' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup>
My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson is based on
their towns of origin &#x2014; Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.
</span> and their contemporaries. Just
considering our indoor living environments today, a typical modern
building is more like a sealed spaceship landed on a hostile alien
planet compared to the simpler, more primitive indoor environments of
the not-so-distant past. Literally, the Brontës&rsquo; Haworth parsonage,
built in 1778 out of local stone and wood and clay, had more in common
with human shelters from a thousand years previous than with our
modern suburban homes only two hundred some years later. Hence, <i>in
just the past two to three hundred years a very steep, vertical
gradient has grown between indoors and outdoors.</i> And this in turn has
brought us to see nature more as a <i>place</i> separate and outside of our
artificial, high-tech, controlled and regulated modern indoor spaces
&#x2026; which, in turn, has lead us to rate outdoors nature on continua of
relative wildness and remoteness from our sealed-off, self-contained,
humans-only environments<label id='fnr.16' for='fnr-in.16.431768' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.16.431768' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup>
By this calculus our three-million-acre boreal wilderness here
on Lake Superior is the nature equivalent of a high-class, luxury
neighborhood like Beverley Hills or the Hamptons.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
We humans must have always made a distinction between being inside a
shelter and outside exposed to the so-called <i>elements</i>. But starting
some six thousand years ago we began to give up aboriginal nomadic
life to establish permanent city-states supported by land-domineering
agriculture. And so indoor environments, embedded in ever-expanding
urban centres, became increasingly self-contained, self-referencing,
recursively derivative<label id='fnr.17' for='fnr-in.17.788014' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.17.788014' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., what is a garden but a derivative, a mock-up of an
original place out in the wilds, albeit with the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits left, weeded out?
</span>, physically removed, walled off from the
wild natural world.
</p>

<p>
Along with this growing separation grew narratives increasingly based
indoors and <i>extra-natural</i>. No longer were we in the West communing
with nature spirits all around; instead, praying to an abstracted
monotheistic God in churches<label id='fnr.18' for='fnr-in.18.9199407' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.18.9199407' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup>
&#x2026;typically built in the centre of a town or city on the
highest ground. When I was in Europe, I heard that to this day no
building in Vienna may be constructed taller than the tower of
St. Stephen&rsquo;s Cathedral.
</span>. Western architecture seemed to reach a
fantastical aesthetic crescendo in the Victorian nineteenth
century<label id='fnr.19' for='fnr-in.19.7189483' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.19.7189483' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup>
&#x2026;with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as a leading
style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
&ldquo;revivalist-nostalgic&rdquo; (Greek, Gothic, Italianate, Elizabethan, Queen
Anne, etc.), perhaps a hearkening back to times more integrated with
nature, with shallower gradients between indoors and outdoors?
</span>, coinciding with an exponential growth in urban
population which had passed an inflection point. Today the steepness
of our indoor-outdoor gradient has increased even more since Victorian
times &#x2026; resulting in a humanity more <i>extra-natural</i> than ever. How
then can we objectively measure our separation from nature?  What has
domestic, urban, indoor living done to our brains, our sense of
belonging—to life, to one another? How can we even begin to trace back
the many rabbit hole bifurcations, the chain of derivatives we&rsquo;ve
taken for all these centuries down, out, and away from <i>nature pure</i>?
To be sure, we seem to have a collective will to make nature better
for us. We may see our dominion over, abstraction away, separation
from nature as fate, destiny. After all, our population doubling in
less than fifty years to eight billion says something to our intention
and ability to dominate. And we seemed to have adapted our human
narratives to this separation<label id='fnr.20' for='fnr-in.20.8492160' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.20.8492160' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>20</sup>
Modern human narratives come at us as thousands upon thousands
of fictional novels, films, plays, while aboriginal peoples had myth
and legends timeless and unchanging. That alone&#x2026;
</span>. But is this sustainable? Some of
us have become quite worried over the question of sustainability, this
long arc of estrangement from nature.<label id='fnr.21' for='fnr-in.21.4981913' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.21.4981913' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup>
Is our slow and gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling frog</a> metaphor?
</span> Let me suggest a
different understanding of nature, namely&#x2014;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Nature not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature as everything going on everywhere. Nature as the myriad cycles
of birth, growth, deterioration, and death roaring on everywhere.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, sensed
this pre-modern meaning of nature as <i>sans localisation</i> inside or
outside. Yes, one went outside, out into the elements. But once back
indoors, a Brontë was not so completely out of and above nature&rsquo;s
touch, influence, <i>doom</i> as we now fancy ourselves. Again, the cycles
of birth, growth, deterioration, and death were happening everywhere
<i>sans emplacement</i> <label id='fnr.22' for='fnr-in.22.7398702' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.22.7398702' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup>
Consider how the Industrial Revolution created urban
production landscapes vast and barren and completely outside of any
sort of nature, spatial or otherwise. Indeed, William Blake&rsquo;s &ldquo;satanic
mills.&rdquo;  This was a change never before seen, a huge step away from
the physical world being solely the purveyance of nature. Even when
the individual left his house he was still within a massive
concentration of extra-natural activity.
</span>. Here again is Emily Brontë, her epic <i>The
night is darkening round me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The night is darkening round me,<br>
The wild winds coldly blow;<br>
But a tyrant spell has bound me,<br>
And I cannot, cannot go.<br>
<br>
The giant trees are bending<br>
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;<br>
The storm is fast descending,<br>
And yet I cannot go.<br>
<br>
Clouds beyond clouds above me,<br>
Wastes beyond wastes below;<br>
But nothing drear can move me;<br>
I will not, cannot go.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
She refers to the wilds as &ldquo;wastes&rdquo;<label id='fnr.23' for='fnr-in.23.3002341' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.23.3002341' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup>
Wilds were often referred to as wastelands.
</span> and as drear, and yet she is
transfixed, frozen to the spot&#x2014;and I cannot, cannot go, she
says. Subjective terms like wastes and drear remind of the age-old
attitude of nature as a terrible master, a sponsor of disaster and
death, something to get away from, hardly over which to wax
poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that, and to be sure,
sublimely. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared directly
into an enemy previously known as all-powerful and unforgiving, and in
so doing she found sublimity<label id='fnr.24' for='fnr-in.24.8429374' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.24.8429374' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup>
More on Edmund Burke&rsquo;s (as well as Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s) false,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t get it&rdquo; tedium on sublimity later. In short, <i>sublime</i> is what
we may find beyond mere beauty, touching what Dostoevsky is saying
here: <i>There are seconds, they only come five or six at a time, and
you suddenly feel the <b>presence of eternal harmony</b>, fully
achieved. It is nothing earthly; not that it is heavenly, but man
cannot endure it in his earthly state. One must change physically or
die. The feeling is clear and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense
the whole of nature and suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not
tenderheartedness, but simply joy.</i> Again, much more later&#x2026;
</span> evoked, and she brought to us in
her lines of poetry a new way of being human.
</p>

<p>
With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around, the last two components, deterioration and
death, must be understood beyond our mechanistic modern take of just
terminal, physical breakage and malfunction<label id='fnr.25' for='fnr-in.25.1469933' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.25.1469933' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup>
&#x2026;as when a car is written off as &ldquo;totalled.&rdquo;
</span>. Especially death
become Death, a quasi-spiritual <i>force majeure</i>. But today
deterioration and death aren&rsquo;t what they used to be. It&rsquo;s almost as if
they were cordoned off&#x2014;at least under much greater human control
than ever before. <i>It&rsquo;s as if through modern medicine we have begun to
acquire demi-godlike veto power over physical demise.</i> And with this
control we have torn down, dismantled a great component of
spirituality.
</p>

<p>
Though death remains an undeniable certainty. Death comes as it always
has from old age, fatal accident, or from deadly physical aggression
or predation<label id='fnr.26' for='fnr-in.26.9303497' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.26.9303497' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup>
For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are&#x2014;outside of war and homicidal aggression&#x2014;all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.
</span>. But a completely different attitude arises when
modern healthcare&rsquo;s labyrinth of diagnoses, drugs, procedures and
surgeries routinely thwart what was once all but unstoppable. And so
we&rsquo;ve begun to lessen the mystery of Death, overturn fate and doom.
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<br>
&#x2014; Psalm 90:10<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalistic,
absolute inevitability so resounding as to constantly shake and echo
through life. Death as life&rsquo;s backstop, container, timer, combinator,
reaper<label id='fnr.27' for='fnr-in.27.5129788' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.27.5129788' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup>
Consider <a href="https://youtu.be/SMNGhPgCKzw?si=L4HFHQuUTnP3j8I6">this goth version</a> of the classic rock song. Had this
been written in Brontëan times, it would have been no cheap,
sentimental gimmick.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
What then if we start to take command of death&rsquo;s agenda, rerouting
death&rsquo;s comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is making the point that by no
means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty years of life, and even if
we get them they might not be that great. And yet we have grown to
<i>expect</i> from the implicit promises of modern medical science a
healthy, quality seventy, eighty, ninety, or even more years. And so
modern medicine has disrupted the two last components of nature
ubiquitous cyclic, i.e., deterioration and death. Modern science has
lessened the wallop of tragedy, weakened overall the doominess of doom
by redefining life as the circuitry of organic machinery, a mechanism
that, in turn, is to be better and better repaired, maintained,
improved against entropic wear-and-tear<label id='fnr.28' for='fnr-in.28.682038' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.28.682038' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup>
Consider the commonplace heart pacemaker, a device that
literally commands the human heart with electronic pulses.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Let me relate a modern story to our new attitude towards death. My
father, who has since passed away, lost his <i>third</i> wife to lung
cancer caused inevitably by decades of smoking<label id='fnr.29' for='fnr-in.29.6278365' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.29.6278365' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup>
Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.
</span>. But instead of
accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I finally theorised that he
had explicated from all the buzz of the various possible medical
interventions &#x2014; including their probabilities of success or failure
&#x2014; a hope that the death sentence of lung cancer could, <i>should</i> be
beaten by some technology lurking in some corner of the modern medical
labyrinth. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed death&rsquo;s arrival to
such an absurd degree. Human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of death able to lap over at any time. But today
the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has all but become an
expectation of, a guaranteed minimum&#x2014;even to the extent that old age
and death are increasingly spoken of as &ldquo;diseases&rdquo; we can and should
defeat. Death a nuisance. My father felt cheated when that three-,
fourscore and more was not forthcoming. But as you may anticipate, I
contend life is life only with death&#x2014;death absolute and not
theorised away. God must be somewhere in all this.

<p>
The world must be romanticised. In this way we will find again its
primal meaning. Romanticising is nothing but raising to a higher power
in a qualitative sense. In this process the lower Self becomes
identified with a better Self &#x2026; When I give a lofty meaning to the
commonplace, a mysterious prestige to the usual, the dignity of the
unknown to the known, an aura of infinity to the finite, then I am
romanticising. For the higher, the unknown, the mystical, the
infinite, the process is reversed&#x2014;these are&#x2014;expressed in terms of

<i>Freiherr</i> (Baron) von Hardenberg (1772&#x2014;1801), aka, <b>Novalis, who
is considered to be the founder of the Romantic Movement.</b> Yes, your
read correctly. Most people don&rsquo;t know that Novalis started it
all. Specifically, it was his prose-poem entitled <i>Hymns to the

</span> eventually spread to eager, fertile grounds in
Britain and the United States.
</p>

<p>
Alas, but here is where I become quite the iconoclast, primarily by
insisting <i>nearly everyone has got Romanticism wrong!</i> I posit that
Novalis with his foundational HTTN took off in a straight line into
the Dark Muse like never before or since<label id='fnr.36' for='fnr-in.36.9720525' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.36.9720525' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup>

century.
</span>. Just reading HTTN, one
cannot escape the sheer intensity of Novalis&rsquo; swoon-fest over Night
and Death<label id='fnr.37' for='fnr-in.37.1271174' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.37.1271174' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup>
Try <a href="https://www.george-macdonald.com/etexts/hymns_to_night.html">this George MacDonald translation</a> as found in a
publication from 1897. Amazing how obscure unknown the keynote address
to the whole Romanticism convention has been. I&rsquo;ll try at a better,
annotated version soon.
</span>. Here&rsquo;s a small taste
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I feel the flow of<br>
Death&rsquo;s youth-giving flood;<br>
To balsam and æther, it<br>
Changes my blood!<br>
I live all the daytime<br>
In faith and in might:<br>
And in holy rapture<br>
I die every night.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
and just before
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
What delight, what pleasure offers <i>thy</i> life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night? Thy mother, it is she brings thee forth, and to her thou owest all thy glory.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Simply put, HTTN is the densest, purest testament to the Dark Muse
ever. As the legend tells, his inspiration came from was
grief-stricken after the death of his fifteen-year-old fiancée Sophie
von Kühn. Jena Set writer Ludwig Tieck described the teenage Sopie as
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Even as a child, she gave an impression which&#x2013;because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely&#x2013;we must call superearthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.
</p>

<i>The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature&rsquo;s Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work</i> by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.
</span> author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to <i>thrive</i>, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, but wait,
haven&rsquo;t these bats jumped <i>outside</i> of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of <i>trans</i>-bat-ism. But is that a good thing?
For the bats maybe, but for nature as a whole?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps bats doing better is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis
the rest of their surrounding environment<label id='fnr.39' for='fnr-in.39.7949735' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.39.7949735' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup>
Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven&rsquo;t noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats&rsquo; primary food sources.
</span>. And yet what happens
when a species keeps thriving more and more, increasing its success
statistics, stepping over, beyond any of the natural restrictions that
real integration and harmony with nature would have required? <b>Aren&rsquo;t
we humans Exhibit A of just such an out-of-control species?</b> And so I
ask, how can this be good, end well?  How can a dominant species like
ours, which seems to be always &ldquo;gaming the system,&rdquo; evermore
extra-natural, not eventually have to pay some price? Simply put, How
can more and more people consuming more and more resources and energy,
each of us fantasising about reaching top-dog success and prosperity,
not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?
</p>

<p>
Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to its tightly integrated niche, then
exponential growth ensues&#x2014;which will eventually hit an inflexion
point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards an
inevitable overshoot and crash.
</p>

<p>
To my mind Emily Brontë was a sort of hard-pressed little bat out in
the wilds&#x2014;colony-less, huddled in a hollow tree, barely eking out a
marginal life. Here is her <i>Plead for me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Why I have persevered to shun<br>
The common paths that others run;<br>
And on a strange road journeyed on<br>
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—<br>
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.<br>
<br>
These once indeed seemed Beings divine,<br>
And they perchance heard vows of mine<br>
And saw my offerings on their shrine—<br>
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,<br>
And mine were worthily despised;<br>
<br>
My Darling Pain that wounds and sears<br>
And wrings a blessing out from tears<br>
By deadening me to real cares;<br>
And yet, a king—though prudence well<br>
Have taught thy subject to rebel.<br>
<br>
And am I wrong to worship where<br>
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,<br>
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?<br>
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me<br>
And tell why I have chosen thee!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I consider this her ode to skipping the trans-human thrive scene of
her day and striking out into some Beyond. Again, I must believe she
was a little bat driven across the semi-wilderness moorland, as true
an existential <i>underdog</i> as was still possible back
then<label id='fnr.40' for='fnr-in.40.1453166' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>40</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.40.1453166' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>40</sup>
Compare with today&rsquo;s outdoor adventurer with technical gear
from REI, Patagonia, North Face, driving to government set-aside wilds
in a four-wheel-drive Jeep Cherokee, consuming protein bars and
electrolyte drinks, listening to music with earbuds, taking smart
phone pictures and GoPro videos. Any mishaps? Call for immediate
helicopter rescue on a satellite connection&#x2026; At some point we&rsquo;re
just amateur Earth astronauts, no?
</span>. Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced malnutrition,
contaminated water, tuberculosis &#x2014; pick one, two, or all
three&#x2014;five months after her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the
greater world outside of her tiny Haworth village and its surrounding
hills for a few months<label id='fnr.41' for='fnr-in.41.2548321' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>41</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.41.2548321' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>41</sup>
A stay in Belgium to learn French and a gig in nearby Halifax
as a governess.
</span>. Hers was a world with nothing modern as
we know it, e.g., a cut on a toe could lead to an infection requiring
amputation, or even worse.
</p>

<p>
But then one might ask if her existence in the early nineteen century
was really so very wild and rugged. Today we are swimming in
unprecedented levels of moder, high-tech materialism, i.e., one
hundred times the resources and energy per capita as one of our
European ancestors from 1800. But how close to nature was the
early-nineteenth-century citizen of Yorkshire?
</p>

<p>
When we imagine how the Romantic Era poets perceived and reported
nature, we think of picnics like from the Hollywood filming of Jane
Austen&rsquo;s <i>Emma</i> where dandies and their pampered ladies are attended
by servants at garden-like country estates
</p>

<img src="./images/EmmaPicnic2.png" width="770" alt="Emma picnic">
<span class="cap"><b>Emma</b> picnic in the harrowing wilds of England</span>

<p>
or playful romps like Hollywood&rsquo;s latest imagining of Emily Brontë
rolling down a grassy slope in some domesticated country setting

<span class="cap">Fictional E.B. in a silly, carefree moment tumbling down a hill</b><br>(From the 2022 film <b>Emily</b>) </span>

<p>
For modern tastes nature is nothing as tame as England back
then. Again, for us nature is a <i>place</i>, a <i>location</i> far away from
our modern interior spaces. Nature is the <i>Great Outdoors</i>.  The
farther afield from modern civilization we can go, the truer and more
authentic nature becomes. And so a <i>nature continuum</i> whereby a
trackless wilderness as far from civilization as possible is the
truest nature, while the least nature would be, e.g., a ditch
overgrown with weeds behind one of our forced-air-HVAC, triple-paned
windowed, vinyl-siding-clad suburban houses.

<p>
One key turning point was to finally understand what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats">John Keats</a> meant
in his <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability">Negative Capability</a></i> letter to his brother. In it he describes
what he means by Negative Capability, the ability to not rush to
philosophical conclusion, rather, to let a sort of cognitive
dissonance run its course. But then Keats also condemns Samuel
Coleridge&rsquo;s obsession with philosophical truth, repudiating his

things, bring the bulk of German Romanticism to a British audience.

<h3 id="orgcf642a2">Grand Marais, my sepulchre by the sea?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcf642a2">
<p>
I live in the far-northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called North
Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, along the shore
before the Canadian border. This so-called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region">Arrowhead Region</a>&rdquo; holds
some three million-plus acres of wilderness on the shores of the
world&rsquo;s largest body (by surface area) of freshwater. And to my mind,
this is a very Dark Muse kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, I
cannot go. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but our dark vibe
here must be experienced to be really appreciated.
</p>

<p>
Though I&rsquo;m wont to call Lake Superior the <i>Inland Sea</i>, thus, North
Coast instead of North Shore. This is due to <i>her</i> being so much more
sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is something much
smaller and much friendlier. The Inland Sea is big and often violent
like any sea or ocean of saltwater. She&rsquo;s no simple lake for
beer-and-brats picnickers, windsurfers, speedboat and jet ski
riffraff<label id='fnr.42' for='fnr-in.42.2570936' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>42</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.42.2570936' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>42</sup>
Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her lasting more
than ten minutes can lead to hypothermia &#x2026; at least on the North
Coast. Wisconsin and Michigan beaches can be swimmable in the summer.
</span>. <i>She</i> has a mighty présence, often dark and moody if
not threatening.
</p>

<p>
A deep moodiness prevails. Here is nothing really spectacular in the
sense of the Great Outdoors overwhelming with one postcard vista after
another&#x2014;as we think of the American West and Alaska. Rather, here is
a more subtlety, more reserve, more mood.
</p>

<p>
Though I feel quite alone here in this assessment. My little
village, Grand Marais, the county seat, is only some thirteen hundred
souls. And yet as the years go by we are becoming evermore
suburban-like in mentality. Being a popular Northern Midwest resort
town, We have a steady stream of newcomers who increasingly are not
adapting to small-town life; instead, maintaining their aloof,
disengaged, blinkered urban-suburban ways. So often one encounters
another supposed fellow human&#x2014;only to receive the &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t exist&rdquo;
treatment common on a street in Manhattan.
</p>

<p>
Another social-psychology pitfall is how many people came up from a
Chicago or especially Twin Cities suburb ostensibly to reinvent
themselves. They&rsquo;ve made the leap out of the sterile, soulless
clone-bunny suburbia to now be some new version of themselves. They
typically use Hemingway and Jack London, i.e., a macho attitude about
wilderness and what. I call this <i>Neo-Klondikism</i>.
</p>

<p>
Steger etc. totally different from the real pioneers of late 19th-,
early 20th-century who brought Victorian civilization to the
wilderness.
</p>

<p>
Grand Marais is my &ldquo;sepulchre by the sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Quietude and contemplation in a place far from civilization.
