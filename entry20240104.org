** To begin

(/Note: I began writing this in the Winter of 2024 and it is now High
Summer; hence, my external references might shift as we go.../)

Light snow drifts gently down from the low clouds draped over a misty
boreal forest. Deer in their grey winter coats process along invisible
boulevards through the fir and spruce. Ravens and crows dolefully
croak and caw back and forth. And I burn a daytime candle. Such an
ambience to convey my thoughts, my impressions and /feelings/ about my
/Dark Muse/.[fn:1]

Do you have an inexplicable fascination with things on the gloomy
side? You often find /dreamy/ what others find /dreary/ ... as when an
overcast day brings on a strangely sanguine melancholy ... or a stormy
night is magnificent in a frightening and thrilling sort of
way. Twilight is a welcome reprieve from the hectic, incessant day,
freeing your senses, calming, deepening your thoughts. You've paused
to gaze transfixed upon a lonely, nondescript landscape, a wild,
deserted shore, an old, abandoned cemetery. Just like a decaying,
overgrown, other-century structure makes you envious of the bats
living there. Unnatural is having to get out of heat into air
conditioning and suffer through smalltalk while drinking iced
beverages; truer it seems to come inside out of the cold and sit by a
fire in a deep, shared silence drinking hot tea. Time and again what
they find uplifting is piteously trite out to ruefully disappointing
for you. Panic and nausea well up when attempts are made at
sunny-cheery; then being alone is a relief, not always lonely. What is
spectacular to them is suspect and eventually disappointing to you
... whereas things subtle, veiled, shadowy tenuous, and understated
are intriguing. Stirrings, please, but not shaking or slamming. Their
heroes grasp desperately at happy endings. Yours learn and grow from
facing the grim and harsh---and if it means succumbing to the
thrashing, amen, RIP,[fn:2] c'est la vie, time for mourning
black. Candlelight over artificial light, linen over nylon, old
architecture over new, the genial disorder of wild nature over the
forced containment of gardens. If in a city, you can't stand anywhere
but the oldest quarter and oldest park. And yes, it might seem a bit
to ask, but wouldn't it be grand if every month we celebrated
Halloween?...  If yes to any or all of this, you might understand what
I'm trying to say here.

*** Natural Dark, Brontëan style

I provide here a quote from Charlotte Brontë's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre][Jane Eyre: An
Autobiography]]/. Main protagonist Jane describes the house, called
simply Moor House, and environs of her adoptive family, the Rivers, on
the edge of the wild, presumably Yorkshire moors back during George
III[fn:3]

#+begin_quote
They loved their sequestered home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique
structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering
walls, its avenue of aged firs---all grown aslant under the stress of
mountain winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly---and where no
flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom---found a charm both
potent and permanent. They clung to the purple moors behind and around
their dwelling---to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path
leading from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks
first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields
that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a
flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced
lambs---they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of
attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
and sweep---on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by
moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,
and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were
to them---so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast
and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of
sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for
me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them---wound round my
faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.
#+end_quote

... /the consecration of its loneliness/ indeed.[fn:4] I often read
this passage just to muse upon the wistful, moody, delicately
melancholic intentionally anti-spectacular subtleties she
describes---and how this and other choice moments set the whole tone
and mood of the book. Charlotte Brontë establishes light and dark as
equals, then to work expertly with the gradient there between. The
dim, the shadows, the dark, the harsh, even at times merciless
inclemencies are features not bugs. She does not suppress dark,
perhaps knowing that if it were seen an equal to light it would
eventually prove itself the older, wiser sibling capable of rich,
complimentary contributions.

One notable gradient boon is how she has the Moor House environs so
very abandoned, lonely, thus ultra-wild exactly because they are so
unpresuming and overlooked, so bereft of anything nature-spectacular
... as opposed to some breathtaking primordial wilderness millions of
miles away visited only by intrepid explorers. Indeed, subtle and
unassuming become the older, wiser siblings of grand and
spectacular. Notable too how Jane arrived at Moor House---half dead
from exposure on her hands and knees, thus, adding complete
vulnerability to this sublime mix. And once recovered, she is still
every bit the underdog---relative to us today in our modern
nature-dominating developed world. This point is key to what I'll say
later...

*** Nature staged...

The second half of my childhood was in Tennessee, and my favourite
place was the Great Smoky Mountains National Park high on the
Appalachian Mountains border of Tennessee and North Carolina. The
/Smokies/ are a federally protected, quasi-pristine wilderness of
522,419 acres, surrounded by lesser-protected though still completely
wilderness USDA National Forest lands adding another million or so
acres. Statistics say the national park itself is the most-visited of
all U.S. national parks with nearly fourteen million tourists per
year,[fn:5] with additional tourist attractions and accommodations all
around the park boundaries. And what are these visitors doing? Only a
small fraction are actually out on the park's extensive wilderness
trails hiking and camping. Most are either driving the main dissecting
highway connecting Tennessee to North Carolina or simply crowding into
the visitor centres per automobile. I once visited on the Fourth of
July, stopping in the main tourist town Gatlinburg, Tennessee, where
the sidewalks were standing-room-only; but later that same day I hiked
for hours deep in the park on the main Appalachian Trail and saw not
another human. Indeed. Strange as this may seem, I say Jane's
Yorkshire moorlands are real nature, while the Smokies are something
else, simply because of the sheer abstraction, the artificiality of
their purpose, not to mention their recognition, their publicity
throughout the entire world.

The Smokies are fussed and ruled over by armies of scientists and
bureaucrats at the behest of the U.S. Department of Interior National
Park Service, UNESCO's World Heritage Convention, the International
Biosphere Programme, etc., like a great research terrarium under an
invisible glass dome. Even in the remotest, genuinely wild spots many
miles from any human disturbance, the weight of humanity's lurking
dominance, our collective mental presence is inescapably
massive... And so we have the dichotomy of discovered and
undiscovered, exotic versus vernacular, integrated versus detached,
grounded versus transient, many versus no matches to googling. As the
Rivers' guest, Jane describes a natural and organic connection to her
moorland, while no modern tourist can ever expect to be truly
integrated with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park complex.[fn:6]
Lots more on what nature really means to us later...

*** My Dark /penchant/

Continuing, I am at a loss to explain my dark /penchant/ to those who
do not, cannot, will not get it. Dark as I mean it is strictly a
take-it-or-leave-it proposition; one gets Dark[fn:7] or one does
not. Dark as I mean it was best presented and developed by certain
*poets* of the early nineteenth-century /Romantic/ Era,[fn:8] an
/emergent/ property and a very special private corner of this
ultimately maligned and misunderstood time. I do believe /the Dark
Muse is best expressed in poetry/, and not so well in prose. I, as
well as many others of yore, believe that lyrical poetry captures far
more and drives far deeper than whatever can be lined up in
book-length chains of prose sentences. For example, it is almost as if
the poetess Emily Dickinson used words to mercilessly expose just how
tenuous words really are. She routinely made words give up their
ghosts just to swap in even more mysterious ghosts---again, something
best done with poetry. We'll explore some of her wicked flights into
/thoughts behind thoughts/ as we go. And so when we read Dickinson's
haiku-like lines, think of Zen koans for the Dark Muse.

My Dark Muse often comes on as a /feeling behind feeling/, subtle,
profound, yet fleeting, not hanging around for much analysis or
description. One very important principal, the German poet [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novalis][Novalis]]
(penname for Baron Friedrich von Hardenberg), often used his unique
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_fragment][fragment]]/ style to describe his Dark Muse. And so he abandoned even
lyrical poetry to get even more bursty, more spontaneous to capture
the subtleties of his dark impressions. Lots more about Novalis, the
presumed founder of German Romanticism, as we go along. Dark stirrings
arrive mostly unannounced, a veritable surprise. *Dark is a
gift*. Thus, my exploration of Dark will rely heavily on the poetry of
the preeminent Romantic Era champions of Dark Muse.

** Adding an extra wagon to the modern goth train

Of course I have an affinity with and feel a kinship to the modern
goth subculture.[fn:9] And yet it is one of the elephants I must shift
a few inches from the centre of the room. In very short, I believe
modern goths surely /sense/ Dark,[fn:10] but for whatever reasons so
many of them only want to express it, explore it very narrowly through
goth music and fashion. My Dark Muse would hopefully include, be akin
to what is today called goth and gothic, /but I must go deeper and
more elemental/. If you are goth I hope you allow me to speak to your
"inner goth."

I'll start by saying there is a /natural darkness/ provided by Nature,
a basis upon which we may create symbols, artefacts, icons, trappings
to emulate, decorate, magnify, socialise, humanise, if nothing else,
/bring indoors/ natural Dark. Yes to aesthetics as far as they may
resonate, do honour to Dark. But too often our human take on Dark
winds up overstated, overwrought---all the way out to grimy, ignoble,
silly, scummy, stupid. We imbibe then express what we see, experience,
feel; but I say it must be done carefully, if not respectfully. And so
I must set aside so many of the overdone /gothic/ horror fright memes,
e.g., vampires, witches, demons; mean nasty menacing this, threatening
evil that. Right up front: My Dark is not meant to shock or frighten,
rather, invite, deepen, and enrich. My Dark Muse contains nothing
cruel nor evil nor sinister nor satanic. As philosopher and
psychologist John Vervaeke said in describing the modern crisis of
anxiety and dysphoria, "Horror is the /aesthetic/ of when you feel
like you're losing your grip on reality." Thus, I might dip my toe in
the lake of horror, as Alfred Hitchcock once said, but I needn't dwell
there too long. Mine is not the /Star Wars/ "dark side," not dark
barbarism à la /Heart of Darkness/, and not the psychic dark described
by Freud or Jung. I cringe when someone says, "...and then things took
a /dark/ turn." In general

\begin{align*}
\large{\text{Dark} \ne \text{negative}}
\end{align*}

Again, campy, over-the-top gothic can be interesting, fun, but I'd
rather not lose sight of the source, however obscure and rare it may
be.[fn:11] I'm after something more subtle, discriminating,
inward-personal ... perhaps like the small natural sweet of a wild
strawberry or raspberry versus the chemical sweet blast of saccharine
... natural rather than manufactured. Reemphasizing: *My Dark is about
the sublime*, indeed, /sublimity/. I will eventually deal with Edmund
Burke's (as well as Bertrand Russell's) false, "they don't get it at
all" tedium on /sublimity/ later. In the meantime, /sublime/ is
basically what we may find beyond mere beauty, touching what
Dostoevsky is saying here

#+begin_quote
There are seconds, they only come five or six at a time, and you
suddenly feel the *presence of eternal harmony* (POEH) fully
achieved. It is nothing earthly; not that it is heavenly, but man
cannot endure it in his earthly state. One must change physically or
die. The feeling is clear and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense
the whole of nature and suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not
tenderheartedness, but simply joy.
#+end_quote

Awe instead of joy? Again, much more fleshing out as we go along...

And so I hearken back to a golden era when Dark was the cultural
currency, to be sure, the early nineteenth century, a time when my key
poets, my /principals/ (e.g. Poe, Novalis, the Brontës) showed us how
triste and Stygian can be so very subtle and sublime. And most
important to goths, I'm after something /I will not outgrow/, rather,
continue as my raison d'être sustaining me to my grave. I say there
must be no "aging out of the scene" as I fear often happens with
modern goth.[fn:12] Rather, the Dark Muse should be a deepening and
widening and transcendence for one's entire life.

** No English retrenchment, please

Another ox gored is my rejection of modern dumbed-down American street
English, which has permeated modern society virtually
worldwide. Basically, I mean to sound more erudite, sophisticated,
intellectual with my use of past-century British-tinged English. Why?
Simply because the English used in the early-nineteenth century was
like a thoroughbred race horse, sleek and powerful, capable of
amazingly deep and magical expression. Contrast this with beggared,
destitute, impoverished, needlessly retrenched modern American street
English, which requires a buy-in to a particularly base, ignorant,
crude and aggressive hipster Zeitgeist. Which I repudiate, not going
there. Although I'm sure I'll occasionally slip up.[fn:13]

Back in the day, people could be more genteel, thoughtful,
fine-spoken. Indeed, back when having character and honour, when
showing decorum and graciousness was a way of life. As a result, their
poetry could express the depths and heights of human thought and
sensitivities so much better. Yes, their poetry ... while so much of
our modern poetry is screed doggerel. For example, Allen Ginsberg
acclaimed /Howl/ is really social-political pamphleteering in verse,
not true poetry as it has been known for centuries. And from there
things go downhill fast---into the most ridiculous absurdist nihilist
nonsense. In past centuries they understood the human need for
holiness, grandeur, the epic and eternal. I say all of this is
necessary to fully grasp their exquisite take on the Dark
Muse. Compare this with the crypto-rebel posers we see everywhere
today who believe being coarse, crass, base, irreverent---and
arrogantly in-your-face about it---is somehow progressive and
desirable...

But then I might have finally succumbed to the influence of all those
schoolmarms back in my distant 1950s-60s childhood who made us read
all those old things such as Tennyson, Hawthorn, and Shakespeare. In
my memories they were all nearing retirement Neo-Victorians who spoke
exactly enunciated [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Atlantic_accent][Transatlantic]] and held up "wordy," other-century
English as superior. Mrs Mugwortlawny was right, you know. And yes,
I'll occasionally drop in foreign things---Latin words and phrases, as
well as my foreign language, it being German. You have been warned...

** Dark like me?

Life would be empty, insipid, weak for me, every moment rudderless,
misspent, crushingly mundane without a strong and constant current of
the Dark Muse. It is as if nothing can be properly understood without
the dark perspective. And then I wonder, *is this nature or nurture*?
That is to say, are we innately so, or is this something
acculturated?[fn:14] I /feel/ it is the former. One simply /feels/ the
tug of Dark---regardless of any sort of prepping or grooming. But
let's do another quick litmus test. I present here a short, simple
poem from my main darkness benefactress, the poetess who stands at the
centre of everything I mean to say about dark, namely, Emily Jane
Brontë[fn:15]

#+begin_verse
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse

Here EB is direct, blunt even. But now we know how she feels. And she
either speaks to something in you, or you are part of the majority who
finds it---weird, abnormal, morbid, overwrought, puerile, even sick or
evil. To be sure, my dark /penchant/ gets mostly deer-in-headlights
responses, if not outright hostility. The openly peeved see my dark
druthers as morose, morbid, as wallowing in self-pity, seeking
attention, dwelling on the negative---followed by a quick DSM–5
look-up.[fn:16] I beg to differ...

Here is something a bit lighter but the same basic idea from
/Christina Rossetti/ [fn:17]

#+begin_verse
Fade tender lily,
Fade O crimson rose,
Fade every flower
Sweetest flower that blows.

Go chilly Autumn,
Come O Winter cold;
Let the green things die away
Into common mould.

Birth follows hard on death,
Life on withering:
Hasten, we shall come the sooner
Back to pleasant Spring.
#+end_verse

Rossetti is darkly fatalistic, though ending with hope bound in humble
expectancy. I like to think these two English poetesses are expressing
an informed, matured melancholy that bespeaks a deeper understanding
of life---all because of their grasp of Dark.

And another poem, here Longfellow's /Snow-flakes/ from a
collection published in 1863

#+begin_verse
Out of the bosom of the Air,
      Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,
Over the woodlands brown and bare,
      Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
            Silent, and soft, and slow
            Descends the snow.

Even as our cloudy fancies take
      Suddenly shape in some divine expression,
Even as the troubled heart doth make
      In the white countenance confession,
            The troubled sky reveals
            The grief it feels.

This is the poem of the air,
      Slowly in silent syllables recorded;
This is the secret of despair,
      Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,
            Now whispered and revealed
            To wood and field.
#+end_verse

Here I see Longfellow[fn:18] looking to the natural world and
/poetising/, to be sure, /darkly/. The idea of poetising, the
/poetisation/ of nature and life was central to the Romantic
Movement.[fn:19] It parallels the long-standing belief that we humans
explain ourselves through, embed our lives in narratives.[fn:20] And so
agents, triggers of mental affliction and depression---despair, grief,
misery---are transformed into more equanimous states of sadness and
melancholy, hopefully bringing us to a higher emotional
maturity. In some paradoxical way, nature and darkness
eventually become healers ... as if the initial agony and sorrow are a
ravaging cancer or virus that may eventually fade into remission, but
we can never entirely conquer, eliminate whilst on Earth, hence, a
strange symbiosis must be struck... As I will endeavour to explain,
being /mortal/ was wholly different experience back then.

This /poetising/ of Nature dark and mystical was the modus operandi of
my select nineteenth-century poets. Rather than avoid, they sought
out, /embraced/ their Dark Muse, something we today in our
brightly-lit, cordoned-off world usually think of as bad, wrong, even
deranged. I contend we have lost this subtle art of moving hardship,
tragedy, emotional crises into a stasis remission melancholy. Today,
we vilify and wage a full-scale war against any and all melancholia
with psychoanalysis and prescription psychopharmacology drugs. Thus,
all too often we are failures at finding a /modus vivendi/[fn:21]
vis-à-vis the trials and tribulations of life as our ancestors once
did. /Fazit/[fn:22]: When Dark is suppressed, we suffer a myriad of
psychic maladies.

*** Suffering

Let's hear from my other principal, Emily Elizabeth Dickinson[fn:23]

#+begin_verse
After great pain, a formal feeling comes ---
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs ---
The stiff Heart questions ‘was it He, that bore,’
And ‘Yesterday, or Centuries before’?

The Feet, mechanical, go round ---
A Wooden way
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought ---
Regardless grown,
A Quartz contentment, like a stone ---

This is the Hour of Lead ---
Remembered, if outlived,
As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow ---
First --- Chill --- then Stupor --- then the letting go ---
#+end_verse

Emily Dickinson of mid-1800s Amherst, Massachusetts, relates human
suffering in a severe and yet fatalistic grounded way. Again, all we
may ever do is disperse the initially searing, inescapable pain to a
dull, hopefully diluted ache in the ever-growing backdrop of time. As
she said in a letter /...but to all except anguish the mind soon
adjusts/. Though again I would say the subject of pain, suffering, and
loss was better conducted in the past than today. How, why? Because
they did not attempt to contain, disguise, systematise, or /process/
greif; rather, greif was faced directly, /pain was shared/, empathy a
way of communal life. And so emotional space was allotted, support was
shared, organic, and natural. Strikingly different from today was
their acceptance of /doom/[fn:24] and fate, two concepts antithetical
to our dynamic, positivist, self-determining,
fix/paper-over-everything-quickly modern ways ... which inevitably led
to faith in God and acceptance of His will.

Consider Queen Victoria[fn:25] who wore mourning black from the time
of her husband Prince Albert's death in 1861 till the end of her life
in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg who upon losing her husband
Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. In those days death was properly, officially mourned. No one
chivvied mourners along with their grief and sadness. Contrast this
with today's all-too-prevalent disassociation, the confused emotional
shutdown, the disorganised quasi-denial and suppression we moderns too
often show towards death[fn:26]. For the early nineteenth century,
poetising life's train of tragedy was /depression deconstruction/ as a
life skill. The slings and arrows of human existence found conjunction
with /Nature/, /Dark/, and /Faith/ through poetry, thereby
highlighting, elevating, /ennobling/ our uniquely human experience on
Earth, *casting a gossamer of sublimity over our natural existence
like no other generation before or since*. Theirs was the deepest
exploration of our true humanness that I know, and, thus, something I
must pursue and showcase here.

** But why Dark?

But still, why Dark? Because Dark speaks to me. But again, how, why?
Lack of a clear and simple answer forces me into a regrettably wordier
one? I might say Dark remains mysterious---no matter how many
different angles from which I try to express it. Dark is something
instinctual, cathartic, evocative, centring for me. Dark is more than
the lack of light. Dark can lead the imagination to riot. The moss,
lichens, and mushrooms in the secretive shadows of the forest incite
so much more than the spectacular sunny vista across the forest
valley. Let's give spectacular a rest...

The fresh-cut rose elicits a simple response, but the faded rose
another---deeper, but for me never "depressing". Here is something
from my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ [fn:27]

#+begin_quote
The new cut rose: Initially beautiful, thereafter dried and
desiccated, lost forever its initial delicate beauty and
fragrance. Once affording a glimpse of perfection, only reminiscent
thereafter. Beauty always some fleeting illusion or madness? Moreover
its eclipse, joining, leading the shadows of our relentless doom, our
march to the grave. And though I live in this momentary brilliance, I
still search my night shore; for until now I have known only of
beauty’s haunting rumour, of love’s promise, those slightest
quickenings of things necessarily rare and formerly peripheral. Yes,
in this moment I may have some of love’s bliss, of roses' beauty, but
I know I shall cherish with a larger, more mature heart the memories
thereof, echoes sent down life’s long, clouded memory hall as true and
lasting blessings.
#+end_quote

Yes, there might have been a nod of approval back in the day...

Let's see another example of Dark get-it-or-don't, this time another
poem from Emily Dickinson, her /There's a certain slant of
light/[fn:28]

#+begin_verse
There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons — 
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes --- 

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us --- 
We can find no scar,

#+end_verse

Let that sink in for a while... The last line includes /Death/
capitalised.[fn:29] Again, I must emphasise how these
nineteenth-century artists approached human mortality much differently
than we do today. Unfortunately, this past-century view of Death has
become opaque, lost. I hope to rediscover it. I'll start by positing
their understanding of Death was integral to their understanding of
Nature...

** Pre-modern Nature and Death

/The main points being:/
+ True nature is the myriad cycles /birth, growth, deterioration, and
  death/ happening constantly everywhere, full
  stop, nothing else...
+ ...ergo, /nature is not a place/, no indoors versus outdoors,
  rather, a state of being, existence itself...
+ ...ergo, no /degrees/ of nature, rather, nature constant
  ubiquitous...
+ ...ergo, death is an integral part of true nature.
+ The increasingly extra-natural, quasi-immortal modern human
+ Romantic Era poets' direct exposure to real Nature versus our
  aloofness, estrangement from nature as separate and spatial.

I hold that our modern, twenty-first-century understanding of nature
is very different than Nature of early-nineteenth-century poets such
as William and Dorothy Wordsworth, or the Haworth and Amherst
Emilies.[fn:30] Alone the fact that our typical indoor living
environments today are more like modular, sealed /space stations/
plopped down on a hostile alien planet compared to the simpler, more
primitive structures of the not-so-distant past... Quite literally, the
Brontës' Haworth parsonage, built in 1778 out of local stone and wood
and clay, had more in common with human shelters from one, /two/
thousand years previous than with our modern suburban homes only some
two hundred years later.

Hence,

#+begin_quote
in just the past two to three hundred years a very steep, vertical
gradient or differential has grown between indoors and outdoors.
#+end_quote

This, in turn, has brought us to see nature more as a /place/ separate
and outside, cut off, away from our artificial, high-tech, controlled
and regulated modern indoor spaces[fn:31] ... which, in turn, has lead
us to rate /outdoors nature/ on continua of relative wildness and
remoteness from our sealed-off, self-contained, humans-only
environments. Indeed...

<span class="cap">Homespun and one of its sources. Original art from Steve-Lease (DeviantArt.com)</span>@@
@@html:</span>@@

Even as late as my own childhood the term /homespun/ was in use to
indicate a poor, unsophisticated person, a country bumkin, a hick from
the sticks. The term referred to a person's clothing being homemade
from locally-sourced, hand-spun and woven materials such as linen and
wool rather than factory-made retail clothing. The early-nineteenth
century Brontëan West Yorkshire would have seen the majority of the
villagers in homespun, all but a few garments not hand-tailored
bespoke.[fn:32] And of course food was entirely from local
production. Hence, a person's daily resources were overwhelmingly
local, a small bit perhaps coming from a nearby /market town/, while
only the most exotic items (e.g., a clock, a fine musical instrument)
would have come from farther away. Today, however, this supply pyramid
is completely flipped, as nearly everything comes from far (far!) away
(e.g. China), while only a few personal items would be from a local or
even regional source.[fn:33] And so in Brontëan times (first half of
the 1800s) the surrounding land was agriculturally domesticated, a
working partner, so to say. Contrast this with today's urban-suburban
populations hardly ever in contact with farmers or their farms. Nor do
we know anything about where our clothing came from. Today, "the
land," as our immediate provider, has been completely abstracted into
concepts such as /ecosystem/ and /biosphere/, which imply we are now
removed observers controlling nature as if it were just another of our
mechanical objects.

No doubt we have always made a distinction between being /inside/ a
shelter and going /outside/ into the so-called /elements/. But
starting some six to ten thousand years ago we began to give up
aboriginal nomadic life and its direct daily contact with said
untamed, uncontrolled elements in order to establish permanent
city-states supported by mass monoculture agriculture. And so indoor
environments in ever-expanding urban centres became increasingly
physically removed, walled off from the wild natural world, becoming
evermore self-contained, all-encompassing, self-referencing, thus,
/recursively derivative/.[fn:34]

Along with this growing separation came mentalities, narratives,
collective mental worlds or "mindspaces" increasingly urban-based thus
uniquely /extra-natural/.[fn:35] Being so completely indoors meant we
no longer were in direct contact with the aboriginal animist nature
spirits all around; instead, praying to an extra-natural, off-world
monotheistic God in architecturally showcase churches.[fn:36] Western
architecture seemed to reach a fantastical aesthetic crescendo in the
Victorian nineteenth century with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as
a leading style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
some manner of nostalgic revivalist (Greek, Gothic, Italianate,
Elizabethan, Queen Anne, etc.), perhaps hearkening back to times more
integrated with nature, i.e., shallower gradients between indoors and
outdoors. This coincided with an exponential growth in urban
population having just passed an inflection point. Today the steepness
of our indoor-outdoor gradient has accelerated even more resulting in
a humanity more /extra-natural/ than ever, billions of people in a
permanently abstract social-psychological space. How then may we, a
species seemingly capable of great adaptability, objectively measure
our separation from nature?

But then what exactly is human adaptability? I posit there are two
sorts of adaptability

 a) permanent thus beneficial alteration, or
 b) temporary adjustment, i.e., an allowance for less-that-optimal
    conditions, supposing an eventual return to optimal conditions.

We humans, I contend, are the second type of adaptable. And this means
we are not truly adaptable at all, rather, only capable of making
temporary adjustments to bad conditions. We are certainly no barometer
species or "canary in the coal mine" of our own well-being. In fact
/we routinely ignore our fellow canary-like humans/, allowing them to
suffer and die, their life examples unheeded. What has domestic,
urban, indoor living done to our brains, our sense of belonging to the
planet, to one another?  How can we even begin to trace back up the
many rabbit hole bifurcations, the chain of derivatives we've taken
for all these centuries down and out and away from /nature pure/? To
be sure, we have demonstrated a collective will to make conditions
better for ourselves /and for us alone/. We even accept our dominion
over, abstraction away, separation from nature as fate, as
destiny. After all, our population doubling in less than fifty years
to eight billion[fn:37] says something to our intention, our ability
to dominate. And we seem to have adapted our collective human psyche,
our narratives to this separation.[fn:38] /But is this sustainable?/
All doomsday spinnings aside, many of us today have grown concerned
over the question of sustainability, concerned about our long arc of
estrangement from nature.[fn:39] Let me start by suggesting a
completely different understanding of nature, namely

#+begin_quote
Nature is not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature is everything going on everywhere. Nature is the myriad cycles
of *birth*, *growth*, *deterioration*, and *death* happening
everywhere all the time.
#+end_quote

I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, knew, or
at least /sensed/ this pre-modern meaning of nature as beyond inside
or outside. Yes, one went outside, out into the elements. But once
back indoors, a Brontë sister was not so completely out of and above
nature's touch, influence, /doom/ as we now fancy ourselves. Again,
the cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and especially death were
happening everywhere /sans emplacement/. Consider how the Industrial
Revolution created urban production landscapes vast and barren and so
completely devoid of any sort of nature, spatial or
otherwise---indeed, William Blake's "satanic mills." Here is what
German philosopher Ludwig Klages in the late-1800s said

#+begin_quote
The face of the land has become a landscape of coerced
"Chicago-ifications" as humanity has fallen into an orgy of
destruction without precedence. So-called civilization wears the face
of an unleashed murderer, while the fullness, the bounty of the earth
has withered from his poisonous breath.
#+end_quote

And an equally hard-hitter from Günter Grass

#+begin_quote
We already have the statistics for the future: the growth percentages
of pollution, overpopulation, desertification. The future is already
in place.
#+end_quote

This was a change on a scale never before seen, a huge and relatively
sudden step away from the physical world being solely the purveyance
of nature. And so even when the individual left the confines of an
indoor space he was still deep within a massive concentration of
extra-natural, human-exclusive structures and activity. Peasant life
in the pre-industrial rural landscape was all but idyllic compared the
grueling, grinding poverty of the industrial cityscapes.[fn:40]

Here is an excerpt from Emily Brontë's /Shall earth no more inspire
thee/ where Mother Nature speaks directly to the wayward human

#+begin_verse
...
Thy mind is ever moving
In regions dark to thee;
Recall its useless roving—
Come back and dwell with me.
...
#+end_verse

I can't read this poem without having a very emotional
response. Indeed, the house of mirrors echo chamber that modern life
has become precludes any reality. And so the choice is simple: We can
go back to nature /or/ continue our useless roving, which can only
lead to evermore alienation---from real Nature, as well as from each
other.

To be sure, so much ominous and doomsdayish has been said about mass
society in this modern industrialised world---all pointing to the
increasingly obvious fact that our vaunted adaptation skills are being
stretched to the breaking point, dysphoria increasing as a total
ecological collapse approaches.

And again Emily Brontë, her epic /The night is darkening round me/[fn:41]

#+begin_verse
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow;
But a tyrant spell has bound me,
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;
The storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below;
But nothing drear can move me;
I will not, cannot go.
#+end_verse

This the heart of my Dark. Yes, she is outdoors "facing the elements,"
as we say. She even refers to the wilds as "wastes" and as
"drear."[fn:42] And yet she is transfixed, frozen to the spot---and I
cannot, cannot go, as she says. Subjective terms like wastes and drear
refer to the age-old attitudes towards nature as a terrible, grim,
inescapable master, a sponsor of disaster and death, hardly over which
to linger, let alone wax poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that,
and to be sure, grandeur and sublimity expressed in lines of verse was
the surprising result. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and
stared directly at an enemy previously known as all-powerful and
unforgiving, and in so doing she sensed something deep and personally
transformative. She was stirred to write lines that, for me at least,
are the very centre of the mystery of Life, Death, and the Dark Muse.

Now, contrast Brontëan Nature with Ernest Hemingway's
twentieth-century nature. Hemingway and his contemporaries rambled
hither and yon, all over the globe trying to find the ultimate nature
experience. He shut down his emotions and senses and attempted to
dominate, forcing his will upon nature to prove his worthiness as a
man.

Sadly, this was all just theatre. If anything serious had happened to
him he could have been airlifted out to receive modern medical
care. Not the Romantic Era poets, however, who were in harm's way with
no timeouts, no escape. Would Hemingway have done all those macho-man
things if there had been no modern world with modern medical aid just
a plane ride away? Haworth Emily lived in a time when /nothing/ was
modern, i.e., her West Yorkshire moorlands were semi-wilderness, and
early eighteenth-century medicine had no understanding of
germs.[fn:43] Literally, a cut on a toe could become infected,
resulting in death in those times. Thus, nature for a Brontë sister
was not a contest, a show, nor a game.

With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around us, the last two components, deterioration
and death, must be understood beyond our mechanistic reductionist
modern take of just physical malfunction.[fn:44] Back in the day,
death was a /force majeure/---but no longer thanks to modern medicine!
It's almost as if deterioration and death, two of nature's supposedly
inescapable realities, have been cordoned off---or at least placed
under much greater human control than ever before. /It's as if through
modern medicine we have begun to acquire a demi-godlike,
proto-immortal veto power over physical demise./ And with this control
we have torn down, dismantled a great component of spirituality,
namely the reckoning of one's mortality with a deity, with an
afterlife. Where once was supposed a /mortal/, physical plane inferior
an /immortal/ spiritual plane, we now would believe only the physical
plane to be relevant. And with this comes a great psychic and
spiritual impoverishment, the extent of which we cannot fully
know.[fn:45]

#+begin_verse
Life is Death we're lengthy at
Death the hinge to Life
---Emily Dickinson
#+end_verse

Though for the meantime death remains an undeniable certainty. Death
comes as it always has---from old age, fatal accident, or deadly
physical aggression or predation.[fn:46] But a completely different
attitude arises when modern healthcare's labyrinth of diagnoses,
drugs, procedures and surgeries routinely thwart what was once all but
certain, if not swift demise. And so we've begun to lessen the mystery
of Death, overturn fate, consequence, and doom. We've become lengthier
at life, oiled and oiled the hinge...

#+begin_verse
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
--- Psalm 90:10
#+end_verse

This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalistic,
absolute inevitability so resounding as to constantly shake and echo
through life. Death as life's backstop, container, timer, combinator,
shaper, /reaper/.[fn:47] And so I say, as Death is interrupted, so are
the greater human cycles of emotion and spirituality interrupted
... meaning if Death is also adjustable, as Emily Dickinson said it
/wasn't/, then we've slashed at the very fabric of reality.

Indeed, what if we start to take command of Death's appointment book,
rerouting, rescheduling Death's comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is
making the point that by no means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty
years of life, and even if we get them they might not be that
great. And yet we have grown to /expect/ from the implicit promises of
modern medical science a healthy, high-quality seventy, eighty,
ninety, or even more years. Again, modern medicine has disrupted the
two last components of a nature ubiquitously cyclic, i.e.,
deterioration and death, thereby further collapsing our understanding
of what true Nature is. Modern science has lessened the wallop of
tragedy, weakened overall the doominess of doom by redefining life as
just so much carbon-based machine circuitry, a mechanism that, in
turn, is to be better and better repaired, maintained, improved
against entropic wear-and-tear.[fn:48]

Allow me to relate a modern story touching on our new attitude towards
death. My father, who has since passed away, lost his /third/ wife to
lung cancer caused inevitably by decades of her smoking.[fn:49] But
instead of accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I eventually theorised that
from all the buzz surrounding the various possible medical
interventions---including their probabilities of success or
failure---he began to expect the death sentence of lung cancer could,
/should/ be beaten by some technology lurking in some corner of the
modern medical labyrinth. Death was not the long-anticipated reunion
with the Creator, rather, enmity and recriminations over the failure
of scientific procedures and medications. Alas...

Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed Death's arrival to
such an absurd degree. Human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of Death /expected/ to lap over at any time. But
today the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has become an implicitly
guaranteed minimum. Old age and death are increasingly spoken of as
"diseases" we can and should defeat. Death as a nuisance, indeed. My
father felt cheated when that three-, fourscore and more was not
forthcoming for his wife. But as you may anticipate, I contend life is
truly life only with Death---Death absolute and not easily pushed
back, much less obviated.

A sickly Anne Brontë[fn:50] on her final dying trip to Scarborough in
1849 made a stop in York where she insisted on seeing the York
Minster. Upon gazing up at the great cathedral she said, "If finite
power can do this..."  But then she was overcome with emotion and fell
silent. Anne was in a deep and personal death mindset of utter and
complete humility and reverence. Perhaps watch [[https://youtu.be/_yzBEP3Qyvc?si=QBkrGikYxWP7C9eN][this]] on Anne's last
days in Scarborough.

#+end_export

In my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/, which I will eventually discuss, one
character says yes to the question of whether she would go back to
Brontëan times in a time machine. Her friend then asks, But what if
you faced a fifty-fifty chance of dying from a now curable, fixable
condition? She replies, I would /trust/ my life, and /trust/ my
death. Indeed, my father did not trust his wife's death.

*** Teenaged(!) Dickinson's cemetery visit

Allow me to insert a passage from a letter Emily Dickinson wrote to
her friend Abiah Root in 1846 when she was only sixteen years of
age. She describes a visit to Boston and the first true American
cemetery, Mount Auburn.[fn:51]

#+begin_quote
Have you ever been to Mount Auburn? If not, you can form but slight
conception of this "City of the Dead." It seems as if nature had
formed this spot with a distinct idea in view of its being a
resting-place for her children, where, wearied and disappointed, they
might stretch themselves beneath the spreading cypress, and close
their eyes "calmly as to a night's repose, or flower's at set of sun."
#+end_quote

...teenager Amherst Emily feeling the Dark Muse. Here is one of her
many poems about Death

#+begin_verse
The distance that the dead have gone
Does not at first appear ---
Their coming back seems possible
For many an ardent year.

And then, that we have followed them,
We more than half suspect,
So intimate have we become
With their dear retrospect.
#+end_verse

...and probably Haworth Emily's most moving elegiac lines about (one
of) her deceased sister(s), her /Song/

#+begin_verse
The linnet in the rocky dells,
     The moor-lark in the air
The bee among the heather bells
     That hide my lady fair:

The wild deer browse above her breast;
     The wild birds raise their brood;
And they her smiles of love caressed
     Have left her solitude!

I ween that, when the grave's dark wall
     Did first her form retain,                
They thought their hearts could ne'er recall
     The light of joy again.

They thought the tide of grief would flow
     Unchecked through future years;
But where is all their anguish now,
     And where are all their tears?

Well, let them fight for honor's breath,
     Or pleasure's shade pursue---
The dweller in the land of death
     Is changed and careless too.               

And, if their eyes should watch and weep
     Till sorrow's source were dry,
She would not, in her tranquil sleep,
     Return a single sigh!

Blow, west-wind, by the lonely mound,
     And murmur, summer-streams---
There is no need of other sound
     To soothe my lady's dreams.
#+end_verse

Indeed...

** Night and Death according to Novalis

#+begin_quote
The world must be romanticised. In this way we will find again its
primal meaning. Romanticising is nothing but raising to a higher power
in a qualitative sense. In this process the lower Self becomes
identified with a better Self ... When I give a lofty meaning to the
commonplace, a mysterious prestige to the usual, the dignity of the
unknown to the known, an aura of infinity to the finite, then I am
romanticising. For the higher, the unknown, the mystical, the
infinite, the process is reversed---these are---expressed in terms of
their logarithms by such a connection---they are--reduced to familiar
terms.
#+end_quote

This is an oft-cited quote from[fn:52] the German nobleman George
Philipp Friedrich /Freiherr/ (Baron) von Hardenberg (1772---1801), pen
name *Novalis*, who is considered to be the original muse of the
German Romantic Movement ... paralleling similar ideals and sentiments
in Britain,[fn:53] which quickly spread throughout the
English-speaking diaspora and the West in general. Specifically, his
prose-poem cycle /Hymns to the Night/ [fn:54] electrified people
around him, initially a gathering of German salon intellectuals in
Jena, Thuringia, Germany.[fn:55] These thinkers rallied around
Novalis, whom they adopted as a sort of naïf mascot, building on
/HttN/ and Novalis' /poetising/, another term he used for the
romanticising of life. Indeed, what came to be known as Jena
Romanticism[fn:56] spread to eager circles and fertile grounds
throughout the West. They raised Novalis' idealisations of
/Poesie/ [fn:57] as an all-embracing paradigm to counter the cold,
dehumanising, thus /desensitising/ implications of Enlightenment Age
rationalism and determinism, as well as the stultifying formalisms of
Classicism. *Novalis sounded the charge to /re-sensitise/ the human
being*. More on this later...

Alas, but here is where I become quite the iconoclast, primarily by
insisting /academe has Romanticism wrong!/ [fn:58] Even Novalis'
supporters, his Jena contemporaries, yes, even Novalis himself seemed
to lose the thread and march about spouting dessicated
intellectualisations.[fn:59] I posit that Novalis with his
foundational /HttN/ took off like a sleepwalker towards the Dark
Muse. However, Romanticism, as subsequently cooked up by "experts"
during and after, became a bloated, overanalysed, theory-bound,
cart-before-the-horse disaster. Or I will simply say German
Romanticism began true but veered off into the ditch---all while
Wordsworthian English Romanticism never really emphasised Dark with
much intention, except for Coleridge's gothic borrowings from the
eighteenth century.[fn:60]

I contend my principal poets were a spiritual and cultural /force
majeure/, like a huge river broken into multiple braided channels
across a broad landscape with little to say about it other than it was
wet. And so my whole point with WutheriingUK is to urge you to simply
*read, sigh, reflect---repeat* and not follow any of the scholarly
technocrats down their musty rabbit holes where the spirit of it all
suffocates. Of course this may seem naive context-free amateurish of
me, but the alternative is winding up lost and clueless as I believe
the vast majority of Romanticism scholars are. Academe Romanticism is
truly the blind leading the blind. Duly warned, let's get into
/HttN/...

Reading /HttN/ one cannot escape the sheer intensity of Novalis'
swoon-fest over Night and Death. Here is a small taste

#+begin_verse
I feel the flow of
Death's youth-giving flood;
To balsam and æther, it
Changes my blood!
I live all the daytime
In faith and in might:
And in holy rapture
I die every night.
#+end_verse

and just before came

#+begin_verse
What delight, what pleasure offers /thy/ life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night? Thy mother, it is she brings thee forth, and to her thou owest all thy glory.
#+end_verse

It my opinion /HttN/ is one of the densest, purest, most direct
attesting to the Dark Muse ever.[fn:61] As the legend tells, his
inspiration came from being grief-stricken at the death of his
fifteen-year-old fiancée Sophie von Kühn,[fn:62] to whose grave he
made a pilgrimage for one hundred nights. The Jena Set writer Ludwig
Tieck described the teenage Sophie

#+begin_quote
Even as a child, she gave an impression which---because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely---we must call super-earthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.
#+end_quote

Indeed, Sophie was the mascot of the mascot, an angelic being of
singular feminine mystique inspiring great feelings and words.[fn:63]
And it was her death that threw Novalis into a state of mind which in
turn produced the catalyst for so many others. But as I contend /HttN/
was not just the gymnastics of flipping the sacred to profane and
profane to sacred as Novalis himself described romanticising
poetising. He journeyed into Night and came back with some of the most
compelling Dark ever. But immediately thereafter yawned open a great
abyss between producers and describer-promoters, i.e., Novalis'
friends who became Jena Romanticists. We'll explore why so many of
Novalis' contemporaries and nearly all of his researchers did not get
his Dark.

** John Keats' sense of Beauty

Samuel Taylor Coleridge is generally accepted as the leading
intellectualiser of British Romanticism, its inception roughly
parallel to the Jena Romantic liftoff. Following is a Coleridge quote
as good as any

#+begin_quote
...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each
other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the
accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as
the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible
directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces
should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike
indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible
yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which
their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and
the process of our own self-consciousness.
#+end_quote

Indeed, such wordy intellectualisations are the usual fodder seized
upon by latter-day academes whipping up copy. Yes, Coleridge and
Wordsworth's /Lyrical Ballads/ is considered the cornerstone of
English Romanticism with its extensive poetising of Nature. But as I
say, these men do not seem to know the Dark Muse.

Now, let us consider what English poet John Keats said years
later in a 1817 letter to his brothers George and Thomas

#+begin_quote
...I mean *Negative Capability*, that is, when a man is capable of
being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
reaching after fact and reason---Coleridge, for instance, would let go
by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of
mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with
half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no
further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty
overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all
consideration.
#+end_quote

Keats repudiates hard and fast ideas, neatly and logically
circumscribed, battling it out for supremacy. Intellectualisations,
great and lengthy, especially of the "Penetralium[fn:64] of mystery,"
are just so much verisimilar[fn:65] ramblings to him. Indeed, to /not/
immediately intellectualise, but to hold oneself in that maddeningly
counter-intuitive state of unresolved---just to see where it might
lead---is Keats' great insight. Feelings and impressions and what-ifs
must be gently, carefully raised up out of the mental ruckus. To be
sure, /Negative Capability/ is about /cognitive dissonance/ as a great
and necessary burden the poet must carry, a mental control technique
key towards deeper insights and understanding. And so the poet must
fly beyond the neat and tidy piles of logical-seeming words to reach a
deeper place. Keats went on to to obviate the sterility of academic
intellectualisms with his simple ode to Beauty. Here is the famed
beginning of his "poetic romance" /Endymion/

#+begin_verse
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
#+end_verse

Take that Coleridge, you babbling, brachial braincase! Again, *read,
sigh, reflect---repeat.* Let this sink in, dear reader.

In the 2009 film /Bright Star/, a touching verisimilar bio-drama about
Keats, there is a scene where, speaking to his love interest Fanny
Brawne, he says

#+begin_quote
A poet is not at all poetical. In fact, he the most unpoetical thing
in existence. He has no identity. He is continually filling some other
body---the sun, the moon... Poetic craft is a carcass, a
sham. If poetry does not come as naturally as leaves to a tree then
it had better not come at all.
#+end_quote

And then Fanny says, /I still don't know how to work out a poem./ To
which Keats says[fn:66]

#+begin_quote
A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving
in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the
lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not /work/ the
lake out. It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and
emboldens the soul to accept mystery.
#+end_quote

And thus, I would posit he, like I two centuries later, did not see
Romanticism as something needs bundling and explaining and stuck with
labels and herded into categories. The point of hearing birdsong is
not to think about male birds warding off other males while trying to
appeal to females, but to luxuriate in the wonderful chorus of
nature. Time and time again I listen to or read a description of
Romanticism and come away feeling the scholar, the author understood
nothing, rather, is simply stringing disparate bits and bobs together
towards some verisimilitude of a penetralia they don't really get or
understand. And so I say the intellectual prison in which academe has
stuck Romanticism should be opened up, the guards soundly switched and
run off, the prisoners let back out into the wide fields and deep
woods. And so I'll soon be thrashing the guards more thoroughly below...

** Thriving versus surviving; top dog versus underdog

In his book /The Genius of Instinct/ [fn:67] author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to /thrive/, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, /but wait/,
haven't these bats jumped /outside/ of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of /trans/-bat-ism. But is this good for nature as a
whole? In effect, the bats have short-circuited their doom, their
fate. Again, what are the real long-term consequences?

Perhaps bats doing better is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis
the rest of their competitors and surrounding environment.[fn:68] But
what happens when a species keeps thriving more and more, increasing
its success statistics, stepping over, beyond any of the natural
restrictions that /total/ integration and harmony with nature would
have required? *Aren't we humans Exhibit A of just such an
out-of-control species?* And so I ask, how can all this so-called
thriving be good, end well?  How can a dominant species like
ours---which always seems to be "gaming the system," evermore
ingeniously and aggressively extra-natural---not eventually have to
pay some price? Simply put, How can more and more people consuming
more and more resources and energy, each of us fantasising about
success and prosperity, not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?

Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to its tightly integrated niche, then
exponential growth ensues---which eventually must hit an inflexion
point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards an
inevitable overshoot and crash.

I bring this up because, to my mind, Emily Brontë was just this sort
of hard-pressed little bat out in the wilds---colony-less, huddled in
a hollow tree, barely eking out a marginal life. Here is her /Plead
for me/

#+begin_verse
Why I have persevered to shun
The common paths that others run;
And on a strange road journeyed on
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.

These once indeed seemed Beings divine,
And they perchance heard vows of mine
And saw my offerings on their shrine—
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,
And mine were worthily despised;

My Darling Pain that wounds and sears
And wrings a blessing out from tears
By deadening me to real cares;
And yet, a king---though prudence well
Have taught thy subject to rebel.

And am I wrong to worship where
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me
And tell why I have chosen thee!
#+end_verse

No, Emily was not "living her best life." I consider this her ode to
skipping the unnatural trans-human thrive scene of her day and
striking out into some Beyond to commune with her God of
Visions. Again, I must believe she was a little bat fluttering across
the semi-wilderness moorland, a true existential /underdog/ definitely
/not/ living her best life, a quasi-equal of all the other underdog
wild critters, as was still possible back then.

Compare this with today's outdoor adventurer who, clad in his
technical gear from REI, Patagonia, North Face, drives to government
set-aside wilds such as the Smokies mentioned above in a
four-wheel-drive Jeep Cherokee, consumes protein bars and electrolyte
drinks, listens to appropriate New Age music with earbuds, takes smart
phone pictures and GoPro videos. Any mishaps? Call for immediate
helicopter rescue on the iPhone satellite connection... At some point
we're just amateur Earth astronauts, no?  When nature is truly in
balance, all participants are underdogs to some degree. But we modern
humans have demanded and gained all but total dominance over nature.

Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced malnutrition, contaminated
water, tuberculosis---pick one, two, or all three---five months after
her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the greater world outside of her
tiny Haworth village and its surrounding hills for a few
months.[fn:69] As I said above, hers was a world containing nothing
modern as we know it, e.g., a simple cut could lead to an infection
requiring amputation, or even worse.

And yet somehow it may seem counterintuitive to say her existence in
early nineteen century West Yorkshire was as wild and rugged as, say,
remote wilderness in today's Canada, the Rockies, or the Amazon
Basin. Was she still not observing nature from civilization's relative
place of safety, thereby rendering her observations just as tainted,
just as removed and relative as ours today? I say no. Clearly our
modern place of distance and safety is so many orders of magnitude
greater than hers, as we of the twenty-first century float above cruel
nature on unprecedented levels of high technology
materialism. Consider how we consume upwards of /one hundred times/
the resources and energy per capita as did one of our European
ancestors from 1800.[fn:70] I contend hers was a unique vantage point,
neither too exposed nor removed from elemental nature.

Still, I'm often confronted with modern scoffers who believe Romantic
Era poets only knew nature from picnics held at country estates where
dandies and their pampered ladies were attended by servants, as seen,
e.g., in Hollywood film versions of Jane Austen[fn:71]

#+begin_export html
<img src="./images/EmmaPicnic2.png" width="770" alt="Emma picnic">
<span class="cap"><b>Emma</b> picnic in the harrowing, savage wilds of Surrey, England</span>
#+end_export

Again, for us moderns nature is a /place/, a /location/ away from and
diametrically opposite our modern space-station-like interior
spaces. Nature picks up somewhere "outdoors," past our suburbs and out
behind our ag-factory farmlands, eventually becoming the /Great
Outdoors/. Basically, the farther afield from modern civilization we
can go, the truer and more authentic nature supposedly becomes. And so
we create a /nature continuum/ whereby a trackless wilderness as far
from civilization as possible is the truest nature, while hardly
nature at all would be that weedy ditch behind a triple-paned
windowed, vinyl-siding-clad, forced-air-HVAC suburban house. Nature
can only be very wild, thus, very far away from the safety of our
space-colony civilization. But let me again be blunt: We do not get
more nature simply because we have gone like explorer astronauts way
farther out from our sterile, artificial exclusively human home
base. /Nature is not something close or remote/.

It is precisely because we have spoiled so much of our immediate
places that we elevate far-afield wilderness to a practically sacred,
quasi-off-planet status. Writers like Ernest Hemingway and Jack London
exploit fright memes in describing distant, exotic, hostile places
like the Yukon and Africa ... again, virtually identical to science
fiction stories of strange, hostile, dangerous, alien planets
conquered by brave, intrepid astronauts.

And so I insist my poets of the so-called Romantic Era were not
pampered dandies with their fine ladies strolling for a few bored
minutes on manicured estate grounds. Nor were they "white privilege"
beneficiaries of the "Age of Exploration" colonialism. My poets were
mainly short-lived little bats in their crevasses and corners, as
hard-pressed as any bats have ever been.

** Eighteenth-century British Dark

As alluded above, the world was seeing Dark decades before Novalis and
German Romanticism, specifically eighteenth-century Britain and what
might be called its /gothic movement/ starting off with the
doom-and-gloom /Graveyard School/ of poetry. After Graveyard, just
past mid-century, came the /gothic novel/ with an obviously formulaic
doom-and-gloom. But then came what might be called the /Night School/,
which became the basis of my dark corner of Romanticism.

*** The Graveyard School

It was only a few decades into the eighteenth century when there
emerged in Britain a style of poetry which has since been named the
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_poets][Graveyard School]]/. As I do with Novalis and his /HttN/, I can't help
but believe these English Graveyarders were more sleepwalkers than any
sort of intentional movement leaders. My Exhibit A of Graveyard is
Edward Young's epic-length /[[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33156/33156-h/33156-h.htm][The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts on Life,
Death, & Immortality]]/ (or simply /Night-Thoughts/,
ca. 1742-1745).[fn:72] Bursting with a grandiosity only poetry can
reach, Young relentlessly spins out darkness and doom. To be sure, he
is Dark with a shudder, full of fright memes meant to weigh down and
ultimately defeat---if taken seriously. A quick taste

#+begin_verse
"When the cock crew, he wept”---smote by that eye
Which looks on me, on all: that Power, who bids
This midnight sentinel, with clarion shrill
(Emblem of that which shall awake the dead),
Rouse souls from slumber, into thoughts of heaven.
Shall I too weep? Where then is fortitude?
And, fortitude abandon’d, where is man?
I know the terms on which he sees the light;
He that is born, is listed; life is war;
Eternal war with woe. Who bears it best,
Deserves it least...
#+end_verse

...indeed, unrelenting doom and woe. Typical of Graveyard School,
there is no hope, no escape, just the weight of an assumed curse
(ultimately original sin?), then processions of lamentation to cliff
edges and fated tumbling thereoff. Reading further

#+begin_verse
Art, brainless Art! our furious charioteer...
...Drives headlong towards the precipice of death;
Death, most our dread; death thus more dreadful made:
Oh, what a riddle of absurdity!
#+end_verse

or

#+begin_verse
From short (as usual) and disturb’d repose,
I wake: how happy they, who wake no more!
Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave.
I wake, emerging from a sea of dreams
Tumultuous; where my wreck’d desponding thought
From wave to wave of fancied misery
At random drove...
#+end_verse

Of course every student of the Dark Muse should read Young's
/Night-thoughts/. And yet this over-the-top doom hyperbole will
eventually deliver even the most indulgent reader to incredulity. Dare
I say at some point it becomes farce.[fn:73]

Though Graveyard had a more contemplative, measured side. For example,
Thomas Gray's /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44299/elegy-written-in-a-country-churchyard][Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]/ (1751) treats us
more respectfully. To be sure, eulogising the dead is a much older and
well established genre, typically emphasising the qualities of the
deceased over the dark, eternal abyss his grave might represent. If we
are not meant to survive Young's pounding, Gray's elegy of a lost
friend is Dark and fatalist and yet reverent and faithful

#+begin_verse
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.
#+end_verse

With Gray whatever woefulness, doom may be swirling about, God in his
heavenly domain still has our backs. In short, Gray will not beat us
down as much as did the hardcore Graveyard Schoolers.

Whence this proto-Dark? Was it simply in the air? As I insist about
the Dark Muse in general, Graveyard arrived unexpectedly, a natural,
organic upwelling---however heavy and oppressive its expression. Which
begs the question, What rises to cultural and intellectual prominence
in an age?[fn:74] To be sure, many of that era condemned gothic and
Graveyard as unworthy subculture. But eventually came a refinement,
which I might call the /Night School/. Though intervening was the
/gothic novel/, which we will now investigate.[fn:75]

*** The arrival of the /gothic novel/

Prose versus poetry. In the past poetry was seen by members of polite
society as the higher, the acceptable form of literature. For example,
Germany has long been referred to as the land of /poets/ and
/thinkers/.[fn:76] Prose in the form of the novel,[fn:77] on the other
hand, was not acceptable, seen as too revealing invasive personal,
i.e., it is improper, unseemly, distasteful to expose even an
imaginary person's life details in such an open and revealing
fashion. Thus, according to this attitude, it was a crude thing to so
freely fantasise human goings-on in a fictitious way. Rather,
literature must ennoble the human as a being created in the likeness
of God, and so let us not dwell on his mundanity and failings. After
all, a novel was neither factual (e.g. a saint's hagiography) nor high
lyrical poetic (e.g., church hymn lyrics or /Heldenlieder/). A
novel/roman was simply too plain-spoken, i.e., the unavoidable clarity
of straight descriptive writing invariably generated an undesirable
ordinariness. And so it was in this mise en scène that the prose novel
bumped along post-Medieval Age as a tolerated, sometimes useful
corruption of writing, a regrettable parallel to poetry, consumed
mainly as was said by easily excited arriviste vulgarian middle-class
women. But then as the middle class grew in power and numbers, the
novel came to the fore, especially in the eighteenth century.[fn:78]

Modern academe considers the novel /The Castle of Otranto, A Gothic
Story/, appearing in its first edition in 1764, to be the official
start of British /gothic/ literature.[fn:79] Written by the excentric,
iconoclastic English nobleman Horace Walpole (1717 – 1797), /Otranto/
is a melodrama set in sixteenth-century Naples offering slumming
readers of the day a big dose of darkness, doom, and woe. Walpole's
penchant for medievalism rode the long-simmering nostalgic
idealisation of the Medieval Age[fn:80], while the adjective /gothic/
referred to medieval Gothic architecture ... although this is ironic
since the actual label Gothic had been used pejoratively in the
Renaissance alluding to the destructive barbarian Goths, i.e., Gothic
architecture was crude and barbaric. Gothic "horror" was an instant
hit, and other writers and influencers quickly joined in creating a
full-on gothic literature movement.[fn:81]

<span class="cap">Wolf's Crag from Walter Scott's gothic <i>The Bride of Lammermore</i> </span>
#+end_export

Above is an etching from a publication of Sir Walter Scott's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_of_Lammermoor][The
Bride of Lammermore]]/ (1819). Consider the sheer visual density and
heaviness of the scene (click on the image to be taken to a larger
version). /Whence, wherefore/ this heaviness, this portent?
Predominant is Nature being Dark in an inhospitable, threatening
way. The human-built castle is primitive, isolated, and vulnerable,
the riders miniscule, exposed ... as though every single living
cell---plant, animal, human---is clinging to life by a thread, and any
dim green and blue hues of vegetation and sea are wholly
irrelevant. The scene evokes danger, dysphoria, as if surely something
horrific is just waiting to transpire. But again how, why? Why such
darkness and what was (and still is) the appeal? Hitchcock tautologies
aside, modern academe has offered theories about the
socio-political-psychological landscape of the times, and yet these
experts only sound supercilious and patronising from their modern
triumphalist perches, as if they are searching for a disease to
explain a malady, weakness to explain indulgence. No, indeed, Dark,
even when crude and heavy, predominates, arrests, mystifies, the
appeal all the stronger for its recessive, ungraspable spherical
symmetry. To be sure, this "coming out" of gothic in the eighteenth
century was overwrought, indulgent with its fright memes, but
undeniably popular and onto something real about the inner human
experience---at least to the Western world of those times.

The popularity of the gothic novel continued throughout the nineteenth
and into the twentieth century primarily in the romance genre---after
the term romance had evolved to mean love.[fn:82] Among others,
Frances Parkinson Keyes (1885 – 1970) was a popular romance author who
often wrote from a gothic perspective. /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonwyck_(film)][Dragonwyck]]/ (1946) is a prime
example of Hollywood[fn:83] does gothic romance.

**** Received gothic

Novelist Ann Radcliffe (1764 - 1823) could be said to be the first to
gain respectability for gothic fiction. Upper-middle-class and
spanning the proto-Romantic late-eighteenth century and the full-on
Romantic Era, she forged a broad readership in the risen middle class
for her moral and otherwise high-brow treatment of gothic
gloom-and-doom. Again, a certain shade of Dark beyond cheap fright
devices was evolving and Radcliffe was a part of it.

The three most popular novels written by the Brontë sisters---/Jane
Eyre/ by Charlotte, /Wuthering Heights/ by Emily, and /The Tenant of
Wildfell Hall/ by Anne---would be considered gothic, and therefore, at
least according to my logic, flawed vis-à-vis Dark. Though by the time
of their publication and subsequent fame, gothic prose had shaken off
its lightweight and déclassé image. Hence, class and taste were no
longer the problem, rather, expression. But as I insist, prose
attempting Dark cannot help but land hard and miss the subtleties and
power of poetry.[fn:84]

*** The night, the stars, the moon...

As personal and original as I want Novalis' /Hymns to the Night/ to
have been, I must present Englishwoman Anna Lætitia Barbauld's /[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_(Barbauld)/A_Summer_Evening%27s_Meditation][A
Summer Evening's Meditation]]/ (/ASEM/) as the same sort of solemn
praising of the Night, but already having appeared in 1773.

Without more investigation I have no real idea if Barbauld's /ASEM/,
weighing in at one hundred and twenty-four lines, started what I'm
calling the /Night School/, but as a working theory, yes, she offered
eighteenth-century Britain a new perspective on Dark with an
accessibility and maturity not really seen in Graveyard and certainly
not gothic horror. As a sort of prompt she nods to Young's
/Night-thoughts/ with the quote, /One sun by day, by night ten
thousand shine/, then launches directly into her summer night and its
canopy of stars

#+begin_verse
Tis past! The sultry tyrant of the south
Has spent his short-liv'd rage; more grateful hours
Move silent on; the skies no more repel
The dazzled sight, but with mild maiden beams
Of temper'd light, invite the cherish'd eye
To wander o'er their sphere; where hung aloft
Dian's bright crescent, like a silver bow
New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns
Impatient for the night, and seems to push
Her brother down the sky. Fair Venus shines
E'en in the eye of day; with sweetest beam
Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood
Of soften'd radiance from her dewy locks.
The shadows spread apace; while meeken'd Eve
Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires
Thro' the Hesperian gardens of the west,
And shuts the gates of day. 'Tis now the hour
When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,
#+end_verse

No woe, no doom-and-gloom; instead, a relentless parade of visceral
and natural Dark hyperconductivity. Barbauld hauls us outdoors to
partake, imbibe, behold the Night like never before. We are not
swimming in doom, rather, we are touched, moved to reflect in
reverence...

#+begin_verse
...But are they silent all? or is there not
A tongue in every star that talks with man,
And wooes him to be wife; nor wooes in vain:
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.
At this still hour the self-collected soul
Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there
Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;
An embryo God; a spark of fire divine,
Which must burn on for ages, when the sun,
(Fair transitory creature of a day!)
Has clos'd his golden eye, and wrap'd in shades
Forgets his wonted journey thro' the east.
#+end_verse

Night over day. Night a more expansive, passive, more nuanced interim
inviting deeper, more mature human introspection. Far distant, cool
and gentle are the myriad stars of a summer's eve, unlike our single
oversized and often ruinous local star of day. And here is some of my
own doggerel called /From a Grandniece To Her Great-aunt At Her
Great-uncle’s Funeral/

#+begin_verse
You see, dear Auntie, 
Day is all supposes, 
Night but only a few.
Night quietly closes 
Day’s great to-do.
Lost on the Day,
I wait for deepest Night,
for Darkness and I must
Decline clamant Light. 
#+end_verse
  
I should say this is my kind of Dark, i.e., free of any campy scare
tactics---fun as they may be. Most assuredly every protégé of the Dark
Muse must read Barbauld's masterpiece. Hers is an exposition of
natural darkness, placing it far above the reproach of gothic horror
detractors. Though /ASEM/ was as far as I can tell a singleton, a
unicorn whose influence seemed to lay dormant for decades.[fn:85] One
Barbauld biographer mentioned a trend of that time of ladies studying
astronomy. But obviously Barbauld is waxing Dark, not just idealising
celestial bodies. Perusing her other poems, yes, she often dwells on
nature, sometimes in a dusky way, but addressing Dark as she did with
/ASEM/ doesn't come forth again, nor from others during her
times. Today she is known as an influential social commentator,
moralist, and educator, but not as proto-Romanticism. And so I must
jump ahead some /fifty/ years and bring in Brontëan poetry as a
continuation of this Night School thread. Haworth Emily's /[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Poems_of_Emily_Bront%C3%AB/Stars][Stars]]/ is
just one her many examples of Night School from someone who probably
had never read nor heard of Barbauld's /ASEM/. Exactly like Barbauld,
in /Stars/ Haworth Emily lauds the night and its starry sky

#+begin_verse
Thought followed thought, star followed star
Through boundless regions, on;
While one sweet influence, near and far,
Thrilled through, and proved us one!

Why did the morning dawn to break
So great, so pure, a spell;
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,
Where your cool radiance fell?
#+end_verse

The untrammelled night sky's depth and expanse over the trammels of
life during supposedly freeing and everything bursting forth sunlight,
indeed. And so the last two stanzas

#+begin_verse
Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night;
Oh, night and stars, return!
And hide me from the hostile light
That does not warm, but burn;

That drains the blood of suffering men;
Drinks tears, instead of dew;
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,
And only wake with you!
#+end_verse

Night School redeems Dark by pulling it out of the ostentatiousness,
the gimmickry of Graveyard and gothic. Probably started by Barbauld
(until I may find evidence to the contrary), it was independently
embraced by others. Let's look at sister Anne Brontë's /Night/

#+begin_verse
I love the silent hour of night,
For blissful dreams may then arise,
Revealing to my charmed sight
What may not bless my waking eyes.

And then a voice may meet my ear,
That death has silenced long ago;
And hope and rapture may appear
Instead of solitude and woe.

Cold in the grave for years has lain
The form it was my bliss to see;
And only dreams can bring again,
The darling of my heart to me.
#+end_verse

Simpler, more measured was Anne's poetry than her sister's. And she
includes the grave by eulogising either of her older sisters Maria or
Elizabeth, or her mother, but again, sans drama. And this calmer, more
introspective Dark kept quietly maturing throughout the nineteenth
century.

But let us not forget the many poems devoted to the moon. Here is Anne
Brontë's /Fluctuations/

#+begin_verse
What though the Sun had left my sky;
To save me from despair
The blessed Moon arose on high,
And shone serenely there.

I watched her, with a tearful gaze,
Rise slowly o'er the hill,
While through the dim horizon's haze
Her light gleamed faint and chill.

I thought such wan and lifeless beams
Could ne'er my heart repay
For the bright sun's most transient gleams
That cheered me through the day:

But, as above that mist's control
She rose, and brighter shone,
I felt her light upon my soul;
But now—that light is gone!

Thick vapours snatched her from my sight,
And I was darkling left,
All in the cold and gloomy night,
Of light and hope bereft:

Until, methought, a little star
Shone forth with trembling ray,
To cheer me with its light afar—
But that, too, passed away.

Anon, an earthly meteor blazed
The gloomy darkness through;
I smiled, yet trembled while I gazed—
But that soon vanished too!

And darker, drearier fell the night
Upon my spirit then;—
But what is that faint struggling light?
Is it the Moon again?

Kind Heaven! increase that silvery gleam
And bid these clouds depart,
And let her soft celestial beam
Restore my fainting heart!
#+end_verse

Here we may imagine the youngest Brontë bowed if not weighed down by
her earthly afflictions, cares, deprivations; but then in this lean,
hungry, susceptible state she is caught in an emotional whirling,
carried, borne up by the natural nighttime procession of sun to moon
and stars. She speaks of her tearful gaze, her fainting heart, her
spirits, her emotional exposure. She is a vulnerable ward of nature,
but tenaciously pursuant of its subtleties. Indeed, back then it was
always subtleties, delicate qualities found in Nature by the
vulnerable if not pathetic human, an exacting counting of seemingly
modest blessings which then gained them a sublime ascendency.

If I wasn't pledged to Emily, I might say Anne has an even finer take
on Dark than her older sister. I might dare to say Anne's Christianity
is more conventional, whereas Emily with her obvious
thought-behind-thoughts mental state took a starker, more fatalist view of
God. Anne humble, Emily defiant perhaps; *nevertheless, the Dark Muse
absolutely owned by these Brontës!*

William Wordsworth was nearly always about Nature, as were his
foundational Romanticist ideals. In his /A Night Thought/
(published 1837) he clearly intersects with Night School

#+begin_verse
Lo! where the Moon along the sky
Sails with her happy destiny;
Oft is she hid from mortal eye
Or dimly seen,
But when the clouds asunder fly
How bright her mien!

Far different we---a froward race,
Thousands though rich in Fortune's grace
With cherished sullenness of pace
Their way pursue,
Ingrates who wear a smileless face
The whole year through.

If kindred humours e'er would make
My spirit droop for drooping's sake,
From Fancy following in thy wake,
Bright ship of heaven!
A counter impulse let me take
And be forgiven.
#+end_verse

Moon and Night would simply be another aspect of didactic Nature,
though he does allude to the more mature subtlety brought by the
darkness. He has wandered into Night School in his /To the Moon/, here
the second stanza

#+begin_verse
The aspiring Mountains and the winding Streams,
Empress of Night! are gladdened by thy beams;
A look of thine the wilderness pervades,
And penetrates the forest's inmost shades;
Thou, chequering peaceably the minster's gloom,
Guid'st the pale Mourner to the lost one's tomb;
Canst reach the Prisoner---to his grated cell
Welcome, though silent and intangible!---
And lives there one, of all that come and go
On the great waters toiling to and fro,
One, who has watched thee at some quiet hour
Enthroned aloft in undisputed power,
Or crossed by vapoury streaks and clouds that move
Catching the lustre they in part reprove---
Nor sometimes felt a fitness in thy sway
To call up thoughts that shun the glare of day,
And make the serious happier than the gay?

If I previously alluded Wordsworth concentrated on Nature over Dark,
with these choice few lines he completely owns the Dark Muse, indeed.

Allow me to mention another Night Schooler, namely, the Swiss poet
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Keller][Gottfried Keller]]. Again, he is even later by some three or four
decades than the Brontës or Wordsworth. Here is his /Winternacht/ or
/Winter Night/

#+begin_verse
Not a wingbeat went through the world;
silent and brilliant lay the white snow.
Not a puff of cloud hung in the starry canopy,
no wave surged in the torpid lake.
 
From the depths climbed a lake-tree,
to its crown encased in ice;
and upon its branches climbed the water nymph,
gazing up through the green ice.
 
There I stood upon the thin glass
that separated me from the black depths;
Close beneath my feet I saw
her white beauty, limb for limb.
 
With smothered sorrow she groped
here and there on the hard barrier.
Never will I will forget her dark expression;
always, always, shall it remain in my mind!
#+end_verse

One of my favourites, I have always wondered what the protagonist did
with the rest of his life. Did he return to the lake to try and find
his water nymph; or did he resign himself to his mortal and mundane
life? In any event, the mystery and allure of a forest in deep winter
night is undeniable. Such magic and mystery obviously could not have
occurred in daylight. Like Edgar Allan Poe's /The Raven/, which we
will discuss below, there is a melancholy over a loss that deepens and
ultimately enriches.

And so with Night School first there is Nature dark, then human
reflection upon that natural Dark; indeed, recitations of the world in
darkness give subtle rise to the finest, keenest insights and
feelings.

** Romanticism

If a group of people enter a restaurant together the maître d' will
probably assume they are a party and want a single table. This is a
good analogy to what has happened to my Dark principals over the
years. I certainly have a lot to say about what has come to be known
as /Romanticism/,[fn:86] as it is the catch-all term meant to make my
principals sit at the same table and seem good company.

By now the reader knows I want my principals to have come by their
sublime poetry "as naturally as leaves come to a tree," as the film
/Bright Star/'s Keats said. I insist my visionaries were just that,
timeless and visionary. Yes, they might have had much in common,
obviously a time frame, but I cannot abide with reducing them to
puppets dangling on strings connected, owing to proto-this or
precursor-that on some academe's assembly line.[fn:87] Of course my
principals were of their times, and yet outliers, outsiders, unicorns,
not for lumping together or lining up on a labelled shelf. Worse, I
also insist their actual lives give little solid insight into their
gifts. And yet we have this most /unnatural/ box, this clammy
container created by both contemporaries of the day, then subsequent
generations of experts to hold, control, own, to /jail/ my greats,
this thing they call /Romanticism/. And so I say again, gripping
butterflies squashes them.

Conjuring up influences is bread-and-butter Romantic Era
academics. One hot mess is the [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0144q90/episodes/guide][BBC's series on Romanticism]][fn:88]
hosted by English historian Peter Ackroyd. And then severe,
left-brained Bertrand Russell in his /The History of Western
Philosophy/ mangles away at Romanticism in his consummate pedantic
way. These are Exhibit A-1 and A-2 of people who don't get it but must
sound important erudite.

*** Feelings, emotions, innocence, nature ... anything else?

So many proofs of "Abstract Topological Romanticism" begin with this
set of axiomatic equations[fn:89]

\begin{align*}
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{feelings}}, \\
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{emotions}}, \\
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{innocence}}, \\
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{nature}}
\end{align*}

for to build theorems whereby Romanticism was a spirited
anti-rationalist (unrational, disrational, irrational?), predominantly
vernal youthful /revolt/ against the soulless straitjacket, the
supposedly failed humanism of Enlightenment logic, as well as stodgy,
urban-centric classicism as well ... basically, anything established
and coming before. Like hallucinating AI chatbots, academe spins and
tangles cords and wires, connecting up Descartes, Rousseau, the
American and French Revolutions, Defoe, Spinoza, Bacon, Hobbs,
Shakespeare,[fn:90] ... Buddha, Jesus, Merlin, the pope, etc., to form
massive graphs of vertices and edges encompassing the near and distant
past---the denser, the more far-fetched the better. And yet this
microscopic literary DNA matching is mostly happening long after the
fact in a modern setting, separate, aloof, and ultimately terminally
clueless. So often my beloved visionaries are made out to be
anachronistically-tagged proto-Beat, archetypal-hippie,
back-to-nature, right-brain contrarian iconoclasts doing their
anti-Establishment thing.[fn:91]

The famous Oxford professor Isaiah Berlin[fn:92] described Romanticism
as

+ a new and restless spirit, seeking /violently/ to burst through old
  and cramping forms,[fn:93]
+ a /nervous/ preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of
  consciousness,
+ a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual
  movement and change,
+ an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life,
+ a /passionate/ effort at self-assertion both individual and
  collective,
+ a search after means of expressing an /unappeasable yearning for
  unattainable goals/.

Especially the last point makes my principals sound like children who
want everything in life's candy shop. Again, an intentionality is
implied that my principals most certainly did not bring---leading us
once more to the disjunction between latter-day analysts and the
original, now grave-mute creators. But then the question Berlin raised
at the beginning of his first lecture, namely, whether this was really
a movement at all---or just a state of mind always "in the air,"
emerging then fading, as I might add, like virtual quantum particles
blinking in and out of existence...

Similarly, Berlin cannot nail down what supposed adherents to
Romanticism in the presumed middle of the Romanic Era really wanted or
were about. He imagines interviewing Romanticism proponents of the
times

#+begin_quote
Suppose you had spoken to these persons. You would have found that
their ideal of life was approximately of the following kind
... integrity, sincerity, readiness to sacrifice one's life to some
inner light, dedication to some ideal for which it is worth
sacrificing all that one is, for which it is worth both living and
dying. You would have found that they were not primarily interested in
knowledge, or in the advance of science, not interested in political
power, not interested in happiness, not interested, above all, in
adjustment to life, in finding your place in society, in living at
peace with your government, even in loyalty to your king or to your
republic. You would have found that common sense, moderation, was very
far from their thoughts.
#+end_quote

Granted, Berlin seems to cotton on to how very cryptic and fluid it
all was back then. But again, this is just a proponent, a person in
the stands. Imagine what one of the players on the field believed. And
yet he continues mistaking the chance geometry on the forest floor for
a path that really was never there.

As a writer I can say writing is strange. I once sat down and tried to
write something prose without any prior ideas or prompts. I simply
asked myself over and over "What are you trying to say?" And out came
a wild story of a Byronic hero, probably a ghost, pacing up and down a
past-century street in eternal twilight being reclaimed by encroaching
Nature. Right. I can say yes to Berlin's not-interesteds above, but
then I stand as he does before the question of /What are we trying to
do?/ In my case a dark, gothic novella popped out of all the confusion
and blockage---long before I had gained any understanding of
Dark. This lack of definite is quite obvious in my principals as well.

For example, much is made by latter-day experts of the "writing
contest" held by Byron, the Shelleys, Mary and Percy, and John
Polidori in the summer of 1816. Indeed, there could be nothing more
Dark than an unnaturally (volcanic eruption-induced) cold, wet, and
dark summer in a villa on Lake Geneva. If you have ever been around
intelligent, creative people who are throwing around ideas, you'll
know how wild and unpredictable it can be. Out of that summer's
endeavour came /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein][Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]/ written by
Mary Shelley,[fn:94] /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vampyre][The Vampyre; A Tale]]/ written by John Polidori,
and Byron's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness_(poem)][Darkness]]/. But again, this is the literary version of
quantum virtual particles coming into existence out of nowhere, with
no real rhyme or reason for to pack into dissertations. And though
Dark was the centreing concept, all three works are really just
throwbacks to gothic horror. In my estimation, they did not move the
Dark needle into the red zone.

Back to my question: Where is Dark in any of academe's Romanticism,
and no, I don't mean campy pop gothic? The feelings, the emotions, and
above all, the vision Haworth Emily describes in /Fall leaves fall/

#+begin_verse
...I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse

simply do not appear in any academic treatment of Romanticism, forcing
me through this manifesto to start over from scratch. Again, /Emily is
not just Novalis' poetising./ When I read her /Fall leaves fall/, yes,
they are words to be processed by my brain's logical language model,
but then they are delivered to the emotional part of my mind. This is
a quasi-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron][mirror neuron]] "yes, I feel this way too" moment giving me
pause and transporting me once again to the gates of the Dark
Muse. /Fall leaves fall/ is its own alpha and omega---I imbibe, feel,
and go forth. I /behold/ all this sublime ideation of darkness and
allow it to carry me. And that is all! No further work for the logical
frontal cortex, let alone scholarship. Haworth Emily infects me with
contagion, and I too smile and sing along with her for the Dark Muse.

Surely we all follow logically-set plans in our lives,
logically-derived "goals." But we are simultaneously emotional,
constantly assessing how we /feel/ about this or that, how we /feel/
in general. This is what I might call the /logic train/ and the
/emotion braid/. Then when I read /Fall leaves fall/ my braid of
emotions stretching back to my birth (or even further) swells and
lifts me beyond my mundane, deterministic logic train. /And it is
exactly this mirroring and swelling that academe doesn't get, never
catches on to/. Visions of snowy wreathes and night's decay force me
from my clear, well-lit logic track. *But then a new sort of sight
emerges, informed by my emotional faculties*. Now a bit of my folk
psychology: All twisted (sic), screwed-up people have one thing in
common: They have attempted to strip out some strand, cut out a
section of their emotion braid. Thus, they are emotionally
short-circuiting. They lack emotional continuity and vision. And so
when dealing with academe's cutting around on Romanticism I must, as
Amherst Emily said, /beware of the surgeon with his knife, lest he
find the culprit life/.

*** Nature reduced to sappy sentimentality

The indoorsmen of academe never fail to raise /nature/ up as a
hallmark of Romanticism. It's nature, nature, nature---but with only
the most patronising view of what it meant to my principals. Nature
what? Nature awareness, appreciation, adulation, respect,
idealisation, idolisation, rapture, fervour, worship. Nature as the
metaphor supply closet,[fn:95] a source of inspiration, a cruel
mistress, a loving mother---an hallucinogenic... All of this gets
batted around endlessly, again, making my principals seem soppy,
dreamy, sentimental, their lines see-through by us greater, wiser
modernist grownups. Academe does not, cannot understand Nature as I've
described it above, i.e., a non-place; instead, the constant
everything everywhere cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
Death.

Academe's favourite Romanticism nature boy is of course William
Wordsworth, whom so many call Romanticism's godfather[fn:96]---but
then routinely pan as a sappy sentimentalist. Scholars are creatures
of their times too, beholden unto the modern age and its urban
nihilist-tainted public. Thus, they cannot help but use as touchstones
modern realist writers such as Jack London and Ernest Hemingway and
their supposedly more objective and unvarnished, realist understanding
of nature. And so whatever Wordsworth said about wandering like a
cloud and going nuts over daffodils is seen as affected, mushy,
maudlin

#+begin_verse
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.

Eye rolls, smirks, and tsk-tsking in today's English department
classrooms. The fonder Wordsworth's waxing, the further he sinks into
our patronisation and condemnation. Missed entirely is his subtle and
sublime. Here from /Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey/

#+begin_verse
...Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,
In which the burthen of the mystery,
In which the heavy and the weary weight
Of all this unintelligible world,
Is lightened:---that serene and blessed mood,
In which the affections gently lead us on,---
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame
And even the motion of our human blood
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep
In body, and become a living soul:
While with an eye made quiet by the power
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,
We see into the life of things.
#+end_verse

Modernism has no concept of, no use for affections, for serene and
blessed moods. Of course Wordsworth is genial here. He goes to the
heart and soul of what I want to bring forth here at WutheringUK, even
though he hasn't included Dark. With words he causes great vibrations
to my emotion braid by /claiming membership to the greater realm of
Nature/---as I would. He's a thankful man, which is so foreign to the
ego-, anthropocentric modernist triumphalist today. Modern science as
well distances humans from its machine-like concept of the
environment. A scholar in the Wikipedia article on
/Tintern Abbey/ complains of Wordsworth ignoring the reality of the times

#+begin_quote
[Wordsworth manages] to see into the life of things only by narrowing
and skewing his field of vision and by excluding certain conflictual
sights and meanings.
#+end_quote

Obviously, Wordsworth was a toxic male apologist for the patriarchal
capitalist industrialist imperialist system, ignoring that so very
many women and minorities were being oppressed exactly as he gazed so
narrowly upon those sights and penned those lines... And so Wordsworth
is just a dusty old statue glimpsed during a quick run-through the
classic wing of the museum, much more interesting, much better things
in the modern wing for sure. Alas...

Even worse, Wordsworth tried to make nature the main house for human
purity and innocence. In /To a Highland Girl/ he transforms a peasant
shepherdess he saw on a trip to Scotland into a demi-angel

#+begin_verse
...With earnest feeling I shall pray
For thee when I am far away:
For never saw I mien, or face,
In which more plainly I could trace
Benignity and home-bred sense
Ripening in perfect innocence.
#+end_verse

I guess you had to be there...

And so nature for modern academe is never more than a /theme/, a
/leitmotif/, thus, a piece of the very oxymoron-ish "creative
machinery"---bereft of any clue as to what Nature as I capitalise it
means.[fn:97] Nature conducive to feelings and innocence, inviting
re-sensitisation ... poetry simply someone describing what they /see/
and how it makes them /feel/ and /yearn/ ... then modern realism mired
in nihilism not able to abide any of this and actively trying to purge
it.

If one rejects metaphysics in all forms, then Nature has no
magic. Ironic is how /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)][naturalism]]/ means nature sans any metaphysics,
i.e., completely materialist mechanistic from the micro to the
macro. Though the term has the root /natural/, i.e., the feel of
instinctive, genuine, candid, sincere, e.g., the smile of a dear
friend... Woe. Alas.

Again, this Nature nativism during the Romantic Era was often
simply noted reverently in verse, as does Anne Brontë in her /Lines
Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day/

#+begin_verse
My soul is awakened, my spirit is soaring
And carried aloft on the wings of the breeze;
For above and around me the wild wind is roaring,
Arousing to rapture the earth and the seas.

The long withered grass in the sunshine is glancing,
The bare trees are tossing their branches on high;
The dead leaves beneath them are merrily dancing,
The white clouds are scudding across the blue sky

I wish I could see how the ocean is lashing
The foam of its billows to whirlwinds of spray;
I wish I could see how its proud waves are dashing,
And hear the wild roar of their thunder to-day!
#+end_verse

I will posit that my principals were instinctively, unknowingly,
belatedly stamping a new European nature worship out of the moors and
forest floors---necessarily independent of whatever had been the
brutish vernacular paganisms before Roman occupation ... orthogonal as
well to Elizabethan pastoral lyric, German /Shepherd Poetry/ of the
post-Thirty Years War seventeenth century, or even the Greek Arcadian
/Bucolic/ traditions.

Yes, Nature, but capitalised. Then to explore how very nuanced their
Nature was. Here is a quote from Haworth Emily

#+begin_quote
All creation is equally mad. Nature is an inexplicable problem; it
exists on a principle of destruction. Every being must be the tireless
instrument of death to others, or itself must cease to live. Yet
nonetheless we celebrate the day of our birth, and we praise God for
having entered such a world.
#+end_quote

In my opinion, this says it all. Later I will dive into the three
poems which I believe describe this seemingly simple but portentously
paradoxical observation best. And again, her Nature is completely
different from our modern locational ideas thereof.

*** Sensitivity

Besides Nature, the modern ivory tower wants my principals, as for
example Berlin argues, to have been more in tune with their senses,
more impulsive, less emotionally suppressed, out to downright
sensual. And yet once again these modernist scholars so often come off
as patronising, like developmental psychologists describing
children. I am constantly confronted with how they so widely miss what
being instinctual and creative was back in the so-called Romantic
Era. Regrettable how one sort of gifted---the analytical
intellectual---is unable to fathom another sort of gifted---the
artistic lyrical.

Though from an historical socio-psychological standpoint we may only
guess (badly?) at what creative, sensitive people in those times saw,
thought, felt. What did the escalating Industrial Revolution, as well
as British imperialism mean to people at the dawn of the nineteenth
century? I posit these external factors set off dehumanising and
ultimately /desensitising/ reverberations throughout society, felt
keenest by the bright, sensitive people. We today are at quite
different levels of accommodating the awful, at normalising,
relativising, turning on numbness to the bad around us. But as the
eighteenth century was ending, moral and emotional disassociation was
not so advanced, reactions more spontaneous and honest. And they were
affronted by what humanity was doing, where we were going.

We may all agree that my hyper-sensitive principals did not personally
experience human exploitation, colonialism, capitalist industrialism,
and yet they knew of it and shrunk back. In their own fashion they
became crypto-reactionary against it. What was conscious, what
subconscious in Wordsworth's mind as he sat above the Tintern Abbey
ruins? All of the negative things supposedly swirling around---the
burgeoning British Empire, the proto-indstrialism havoc all around the
River Wye and environs. And yet his response was limbic pondering. Of
course academe is masterful at describing the historicity, the
paradigms and movements. They make the backdrop of Enlightenment's
cold, relentless dynamism and reductionist determinism visible. But we
miss today the visceral, the emotional aspect so sorely needed. And so
I say, /It takes a poet to know a poet, and it takes a special,
time-travelling poet to know these special Romantic Era poets./

But then dare I, your guide, a poet, be so critical of established,
studied Romantic Era professors? Following is something I wrote

#+begin_verse
And from bygone generations I have surely more than blood.
The loom, the wrapped bolt a shared past, holds me taunt.
And try though I may, little hope there is finding out,
Capturing this force of past souls and blood.
For no sooner is some design of
Art, music, words offered than opens
A far greater twilit space echoing the past.
Alas, that these modern conceits must all fail us;
For the Muses range far above, behind, and beyond--- 
From the heart out to the eternal sea, sky, land,
And everywhere and forever between,
Subtle to mystical to rapturous.

Woe, the tarried songbird whose weakening wings
In late November portend death’s evening hour,
Life’s requisite warmth finally dissipated,
Her once vast blue space closing dark,
The mysterious frontiers setting up,
The shadowy boundary closing...

That we humans may touch,
Stroke the dark velvet curtains
Long before we slip the concealed gaps.
Death would have all such anticipation quiet---
All suppositions. vain assurances flashing then quit,
All expectations rattling, echoing lastly towards stillness
Leaving friends to carry on in dutiful remembrance,
That those, at graveside, must as best they can
Face the darkness and resolutely reach out
Beyond the day’s anguish and sadness
To God and the bless'd everlasting.
#+end_verse

This might have got me an honourable mention back in the day, perhaps
a dinner invite. But I seriously doubt any contemporary Romanticism
experts could have written such lines---half because they could not,
half because to such they would not deign.

Yes, my poets of yore. And as Berlin noted, no political stance was
ever intended; rather, by trying to re-humanise, /re-sensitise/, à la
Novalis' poetising, theirs would be a far more subversive phenomenon
as only, for example, some new belief system or "underground movement"
can be. Socio-political templates do not highlight my principals,
rather, they smother them. But if, say, Emily Dickinson meant nothing
political or even religious, no consciously declared lifestyle or
paradigm, what did she mean, what did any of them mean or want? To me
what they did and said seem ethereal and extra-human. My principals
drafted behind the general Calvinist Christian wake of the time,
ultimately deferring to God. Indeed, God. Here is Emily Dickinson
poetising belief

#+begin_verse
The stimulus, beyond the grave
 His countenance to see,
Supports me like imperial drams
 Afforded royally.
#+end_verse

But even then the spirit would be shot out of the aether. One fallout
due to the Wordsworths' and Coleridge's poetical regionalism was the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_District][Lake District]] becoming the modern world’s first eco-literature tourism
destination, now a national park with sixteen million visitors a
year.[fn:98] Again, we find none of Hemingway's adventure and danger
in Wordsworth's /Home at Grasmere/[fn:99]

#+begin_verse
...
The place from which I looked was soft and green,
Not giddy yet aerial, with a depth
Of Vale below, a height of Hills above.
Long did I halt; I could have made it even
My business and my errand so to halt.
For rest of body ’twas a perfect place,
All that luxurious nature could desire,
But tempting to the Spirit; who could look
And not feel motions there? I thought of clouds
That sail on winds; of breezes that delight
To play on water, or in endless chase
Pursue each other through the liquid depths
Of grass or corn, over and through and through,
In billow after billow, evermore;
Of Sunbeams, Shadows, Butterflies and Birds,
Angels and winged Creatures that are Lords
Without restraint of all which they behold.
...
#+end_verse

And so he is more what many today might in slight would call
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottagecore][Cottagecore]]/ than, e.g., Jack London's cast of wolves ripping throats
in his relentlessly savage, slant-anthropomorphic /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Fang][White Fang]]/. So
many of the tourists to Tintern Abbey or the Lake District expect to
/feel/ something of what Wordsworth felt, extra-experiential to the
unique scenery itself. /They want to be moved like he was moved./

*** East and West: escaping versus "working with" suffering

As a teen growing up in the early 1970s, I, like so many around me,
fell under the spell of the strange and mysterious /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_(1972_TV_series)][Kung Fu]]/, an
American TV series premiering in 1972. For a kid in Tennessee /Kung
Fu/ was a pop introduction to Eastern religion and philosophy. The
main character, Kwai Chang Caine, was a Chinese-American orphan raised
in a Chinese Shaolin Buddhist monastery in the mid-1800s, who as a
young man escaped China to America after killing an aristocrat. Orphan
Caine was taught the Kung Fu martial arts style, but also the whole
Buddhist pacifist, non-resistant approach to life, both of which he
embodies, episode after episode, as he roams about the American wild
west of the mid-nineteenth century as an aesthete itinerant on the run
from the Chinese government.

Wanting to know more, I found a book on Zen Buddhism where I found the
concept of /Unsui/, which is Japanese and means /cloud, water/. The
term also refers to a novice monk

#+begin_quote
In Japan, one receives unsui ordination at the beginning of formal
ordained practice, and this is often perceived as 'novice ordination.'
#+end_quote

This dense, written-for-adults book further described unsui
metaphorically, saying water exhibits perfect passive resistance,
i.e., it changes states if challenged: as water it flows around
impediments; as steam it evaporates away from heat; if blocked or
dammed, it simply waits supremely patient; if frozen, likewise,
waits---but nothing can stop its eventual movement to the sea. But now
I see this as irrelevant to my Dark Muse, a false path, so to speak.

/Kung Fu/ begins with Caine as a young man killing a nobleman who has
senselessly killed his beloved master. Which of course is the
antithesis of the Buddhist way; hence, Caine must leave the monastery,
and China as well, heading to America. I remember we were all
enthralled with Kwai Chang's adventures; kids and adults alike all
looked forward to each new episode. And yet looking back I can now say
with assurance this extreme Eastern pacifism is not for me.

Buddhism wants enlightenment---which supposedly raises us to a higher
trans-human state. For example, once enlightened we no longer should
be dragged down by worldly cares, needs, desires, hassles. But how
many actually reach this state, which sounds to me like some
quasi-permanent version of Dostoyevski's presence of eternal harmony?
This is why I cannot take seriously any sort of Eastern religion with
the stated goal of enlightenment, if for no other reason than /so very
few people ever arrive at this self-actualization/. And where is my
Dark in the East?  Say what you will about it, the Calvinist-flavoured
Christianity of the Brontë sisters is the house spirituality of my
Dark Muse.

But can there be a Western Zen? To be sure, Emily Brontë's /All
creation is equally mad.../ presents a deep koan-like paradox. Which
would seem to fall into fatalism and stoicism rather than offering any
guarantees to higher consciousness. Buddhism promises relief from
suffering. My Dark, however, "works with suffering."

My principals never sought to offer anything as spiritually
comprehensive as Buddhism, no sort of spiritual path to higher
anything. They held seeds, not finished canned goods. They expanded on
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturm_und_Drang][Sturm und Drang]]/ but did not draw out any sort of architectural
plans. Interaction with, movement in Nature; but no political or
spiritual paradigms towards specified goals for the mundane
world. They lived haphazardly, spoke in fragments, resulting in
anti-comprehensive. One final observation of Goethe was similar: He
was central to this time, but centralised nothing. He too saw Nature
as everything, if for nothing more than endless empirical study as had
his dear friend Alexander von Humboldt. As Goethe notes, Nature has
endless facets impossible to comprehend as a whole...

#+begin_quote
Nature has no system, she has, she is life and consequence from an
unknown centre out to an unrecognisable perimeter.
#+end_quote

And how could just poetised feelings---Longfellow's piteous ruing of
snowflakes, Novalis' swooning over the night---counter all the violent
dog-eat-dog of mad creation, all the smashing, banging, clanging of
real world Britain over the moorland horizon? While Goethe assuredly
did, my principals never attempted to own the aesthetics of their
times. What then could have been the artistic, aesthetic compliment to
colonialism, Newtonian science, capitalist industrialism, Marxist
revolution?

And therein lies so much of the irony and paradox of what my
principals stirred up. What sense did naming William "Dances With
Daffodils" Wordsworth poet laureate of the British Empire make?[fn:100]
No, what the Romantic Era poets and artists created was, as we might
categorise (sic) it, a very /underground/ aesthetic, an anti-movement
that blanched and faded in the presence of political struggles, that
called no seekers, no bhikkhus, no one torturing themselves into the
lotus position to higher spiritual planes. Grim was the new industrial
urban world where the once blithely subsistence peasants had become
wage slaves living in the misery of urban squalor, hunger, and
exploitation. /Homo homini lupus/ [fn:101] had raised its terrible head
in a new and awful way. The /radical philosophers/, as the
proto-Marxist activists were called by some, attacked seeking power
from the wealthy, i.e., the modern haves versus the have-nots. Marxist
dialectics insisted that when the gradient became too great
necessarily the revolution will begin.[fn:102] But my principals
seemed mute. Or were they?

Even so, many opposed what Romanticism seemed to be doing and
saying. Goethe and Schiller promoted as an alternative, their /Weimar
Classicism/ (More about Goethe and Schiller later.). To their
thinking, classicism was the best compliment to modern man. But then
what aesthetic could compliment imperialism? Obviously an art touting
glory, majesty, splendor, regality, grandeur to justify, substantiate
whatever terrible happenings were going on out in the real world, out
on the imperial frontiers. Even more poignant was the classicist
envelope around religion, elevating the huge paradox of pious,
compassionate Christianity as a seemingly stop-at-nothing empire's
real underlying humanistic intentions. All in all, Romanticism could
not be applied anywhere except, maybe, on a walk in Wordworth's Lake
District, or from the Brontë's Haworth out to Top Withens. The
Wordsworths offered a new sort of membership to Nature strange and
mysterious, and whether we hold dual citizenship with the current
human race was not considered. So very ironically, Britain seemed to
be saying "Wordsworth is who we truly are," ruing silently perhaps
absentee capitalism for its environmental destruction and imperialism
for its lack of humble nativism. A Britain dominant and ascending
seemingly knew it was violating its warranty.

Germany likewise was in political as well as aesthetic uncertainty and
turmoil.

In 1806, Napoleon conquered Prussia. French troops occupied and sacked
Weimar, where Goethe had lived since 1775. They broke into Goethe’s
house; many of his friends lost everything. Still, Goethe reconciled
himself to Napoleon’s empire, which he regarded as a *legitimate
successor to the Holy Roman Empire*. \\

#+end_quote

This acceptance of Napoleon's vaguely hinted republicanism and
supposed modernisations led many German intellectuals to accept
whatever destruction the French invasion caused, for in the end the
crazy quilt of backwards German postage-stamp principalities would
finally be forced into the "modern era."[fn:103] Or so the thinking
went. But not all were on board. For example, leading Romanticist
painter [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_David_Friedrich][Caspar David Friedrich]] with his /Der Chasseur im
Walde/[fn:104] (The Chasseur [soldier] in the Forest) from 1814
depicts a sort of comeuppance for arrogant French modernisation
against timeless, indomitable German Nature. His visual metaphor has a
single French soldier apparently under a spell, obviously lost and
separated from the French retreat from Russia, while the symbol of
doom, the raven, waits. If any fine artist understood Dark, it was
Caspar David Friedrich. Perusing his works, we see he /never/ stoops
to fright memes, but delivers an exquisitely liminal darkness.

*** Nostalgia and going home

#+begin_quote
I'm a nostalgic guy for sure. But not about dentistry. I don't want
any retro-, old-fashion dentistry. \\
---anonymous comedian
#+end_quote

Novalis the philosopher promoted a nostalgia for the Medieval
Era---which only confused his contemporaries. Likewise, Walpole was
all in for medieval in his more melodramatic way. Later, critiques of
/Jane Eyre/ chided its nostalgic, rustic appeal for English
moorlands.[fn:105] All Brontëan writing has the thread of rootedness
to the land, which should be timeless, but then was often seen as all
too twee nostalgic. What then is going on with nostalgia?

The Brontë sisters languished in obscurity most of their
lives,[fn:106] but as they gradually gained popular recognition in the
latter half of the eighteenth century, Victorian Neo-Romantics kept up
with portraying a softer, kinder Britain from the capitalist
industrialist, imperialist militarist reality. Miss Jane Eyre,
suspected of fairy ancestry, incessantly asked, Who and what am I?
Which was answered, "You are a charge of the land and your people."
Thus was my delicate bundle of English Zen, Dark, Nature, and
Christianity tied together by the Brontë sisters. But could it last,
could it hold up against the avalanche of realism and modernism coming
out of industrialism in the Late Victorian Age? Or, from a different
angle let us ask, How did Romanticism die? Or again, how was it driven
back underground?

Consider the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood founded in 1848, an arguably
Neo-Romantic effort. Below is a later painting of John Everett
Millais, his /An Idyll of 1745/

#+begin_export html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Everett_Millais#/media/File:An_Idyll_of_1745_(Millais).jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./images/Millais AnIdyllof1745.jpg" width="780" alt="Millais Idyll"></a>
<span class="cap">Before internet social media and hysterical helicopter parents...</span>
#+end_export

Millais is dealing in what I call /profane/ or /vulgar/ nostalgia, as
opposed to /sacred/ nostalgia, i.e., a hearkening, yearning for the
profoundly eternal and epic such as mythos and legend. In general,
nostalgia should not be seen as merely escapism to the past. And yet
we surely will not have our emotion bundles thrummed as Millais
thrummed emotion bundles of that time. Of course the Britain of 1745
had power---after favourable political events (e.g., Treaty of
Utrecht) and Robert Walpole's era as prime minister. 1745 was the year
of the main Jacobite rebellion; hence, the patriotic theme? In
general, this was not yet sovereign, domineering Britain; rather, a
Britain still fighting and scrapping for its position in the world,
mainly against the French, as well as still suffering the collective
PTSD of Jacobitism and the bloody seventeenth-century British civil
wars less than a hundred years earlier. Still, Millais painting this
in 1884 would hearkened back, however vulgarly, to, yes, an /idyllic/
time---at least as he thought provided by the seemingly eternal
English countryside, raised up above all as Britain's first and
foremost national treasure. In the semi-wild setting are three
innocent, tabula rasa peasant girls enraptured by an enlisted man
playing a flute, while a fatherly high-born officer looks on
admiringly. Clearly, this pastoral and class bliss was a version of
Britain longed for by the nostalgia-heavy, Romanticism-influenced
Pre-Raphaelites. Great ruing and regretting permeated Victorian
parlour society vis-à-vis the real world, spurring them to search the
earlier Romantic Era and to see in nature vitality and
salvation. Notice beside Millais' /The Blind Girl/.[fn:107] This was
the down-home England they sought and idealised over the harsh
realities of colonialism and imperialism, the horrific suffering of
the urban industrial wastelands Charles Dickens came to chronicle over
and over throughout this time.

English Zen and English nostalgia against the unrelenting brutality of
the world. Again, Romanticism's right bookend was supposedly 1850. But
did it die, retire, was it replaced? No, no, and no---in part, I would
say, exactly because it was never anything as intentional and
wrappable boxable as the watchers and minders wanted it to
be. Romanticism like an ongoing silent-bid auction always interrupted
just before the sale. Was nostalgia-heavy Tennyson a Romanticist? What
about Yeats' /The Stolen Child/ from 1889

#+begin_verse
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
#+end_verse

I should also mention James Macpherson's /The Poems of Ossian/, like
Walpole's /Otranto/, was the supposed field collections of the
legendary Celtic bard Oisín, although most scholars believe Macpherson
largely composed the poems himself, drawing in part on traditional
Gaelic poetry he had researched. As Wikipedia says

#+begin_quote
Though the stories "are of endless battles and unhappy loves", the
enemies and causes of strife are given little explanation and
context. Characters are given to killing loved ones by mistake, and
dying of grief, or of joy. There is very little information given on
the religion, culture or society of the characters, and buildings are
hardly mentioned. The landscape "is more real than the people who
inhabit it. Drowned in eternal mist, illuminated by a decrepit sun or
by ephemeral meteors, it is a world of greyness."
#+end_quote

Yes, Dark, but clearly more of the predominant Medieval Age nostalgia
of the eighteenth century, especially since the authenticity is highly
suspect, i.e., wishful and aggrandising penning on MacPherson's part.

Arthur Conan Doyle believed in fairies. Julia Margaret Cameron, half
of her life spent after 1850, conjured nostalgia in her
ground-breaking photography with its soft-focus and historical
themes.[fn:108] Nostalgia, originally a medical condition,[fn:109]
morphed into the social-psychological phenomenon of idolising the
past, vulgar nostalgia selectively reviving, reanimating hoped-for
aspects of the past. Nostalgia's motivation? Again, eighteenth-century
gothic doom coincided with the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution's inflexion point, as well as the ghastly reverberations of
colonialism, e.g., slavery. Doom, indeed, where sin's ever-compounding
interest overwhelms any short-term profits or gains. Here is how
J.R.R. Tolkien responded when his fantasy writings were called
/escapist/

#+begin_quote
Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is
imprisoned by the enemy, don’t we consider it his duty to escape?
#+end_quote

He went on to say the prisoner's natural urge is to escape and run
home. Where is this home? Granted, the intersection of nostalgia and
Dark is minimal, but I say mist dims light, softens lines, and all
nostalgia involves the obscurants mist and shadow. Nostalgia is mainly
for the thrumming of the emotion braid and not at all the calibration
of the logic train. But yes, home---perhaps the home Jane Eyre
described with the Rivers family on the Northern moorlands?  Tolkien
as a Neo-Victorian Luddite closet-Monarchist was the next stepping
stone after George MacDonald, Tolkien's idol. So who is a stepping
stone after Tolkien, who before MacDonald?... But yes, it is always
about home. Ursula Le Guin said an adult is not a dead child, rather a
child that survived. But can that child in us take a faery
hand-in-hand and return?  Faerie as a hyper-idealised home paralleling
Eden? Consider Elizabeth Siddal, (1829 - 1862)[fn:110] model, artist,
poetess, her /Gone/

#+begin_verse
To touch the glove upon her tender hand,
To watch the jewel sparkle in her ring,
Lifted my heart into a sudden song
As when the wild birds sing.

To touch her shadow on the sunny grass,
To break her pathway through the darkened wood,
Filled all my life with trembling and tears
And silence where I stood.

I watch the shadows gather round my heart,
I live to know that she is gone

Gone gone for ever, like the tender dove
That left the Ark alone.
#+end_verse

Indeed, this living, this witnessing to know what is gone train-like
into the past. Then her /Lord May I Come?/

#+begin_verse
Life and night are falling from me,
Death and day are opening on me,
Wherever my footsteps come and go,
Life is a stony way of woe.
Lord, have I long to go?

Hallow hearts are ever near me,
Soulless eyes have ceased to cheer me:
Lord may I come to thee?

Life and youth and summer weather
To my heart no joy can gather.
Lord, lift me from life’s stony way!
Loved eyes long closed in death watch for me:
Holy death is waiting for me

Lord, may I come to-day?

My outward life feels sad and still
Like lilies in a frozen rill;
I am gazing upwards to the sun,
Lord, Lord, remembering my lost one.
O Lord, remember me!

How is it in the unknown land?
Do the dead wander hand in hand?
God, give me trust in thee.

Do we clasp dead hands and quiver
With an endless joy for ever?
Do tall white angels gaze and wend
Along the banks where lilies bend?
Lord, we know not how this may be:
Good Lord we put our faith in thee

O God, remember me.
#+end_verse

Whether the propriety of sacred nostalgia or the handy, heart-warming
profane nostalgia, the eighteenth century saw Nostalgia capitalised as
the West sought to witness a home of yore, necessarily bound to the
land and honouring the memories of the ancestors. Indeed, Miss Siddal,
we live to know what is gone.

*** Desensitisation, re-sensitisation

With an ever-faster-spinning planet there is antagonism with

#+begin_quote
The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof,
but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every
one that is born of the Spirit. \\
---John 3:8

And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all
things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to
the sons of man to be exercised therewith. \\
---Ecclesiastes 1:13
#+end_quote

...humanity born of Spirit forever feeling wind in our faces and
circling around wisdom ... almost as if we may find a sanctity in what
may emerge from such consciousness above behaviorist
stimulus-response, action-reaction, beyond the modern gauge of the
personal logic train, besides the day's to-dos---orderings, changes,
updates, progress.

Perhaps my Romantic Era principals sensed the hyper-individualistic,
the utilitarian, the /reptilian/ mindset coming from the middle-class
capitalist industrialists as an egregious desensitisation regime
spreading throughout society, and so they threw /re-sensitisation/ at
it. The stereotypical middle-class industrialist rising during the
Enlightenment was a pragmatic utilitarian who, after absorbing the
message of Adam Smith's /The Wealth of Nations/ (1776), had shucked
off [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noblesse_oblige][noblesse oblige]],[fn:111] the New Testament beatitudes, and any
lingering other-century nostalgia and sentimentality to forge ahead as
the consummate self-reliant individualist laser-focused on financial
wealth. These men projected a stripped-down emotional psychological
persona, indeed, a new desensitisation regime. Capitalism, Marxism,
modernism in general dispensed with traditional aesthetics, forcing my
principals to shore up an aesthetical foundation. But as I say, there
was no call to political action, and really no prescription of
aesthetics either, just their fatalist, nostalgic Englishness. But
could they succeed? Could they place something of value on a level
above the fray?

** The Romantic Movement compartmentalised

#+begin_quote
And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books

---Ecclesiastes 12:12
#+end_quote

And yet academe's version of so-called Romanticism is still a very big
elephant in the middle of our Dark room.[fn:112] And so what to do
with this beast wont to obfuscate, to blunt and talk to death the work
of my genial, gifted principals? When not /completely/ missing the
Dark Muse, academia can only pigeon-hole it as gothic fright. Again,
one of the main tasks of WutheringUK is to get Dark out of its
academic and popular media ruts. Nonetheless, we should conduct an
inspection of the compartments of the Romanticism box.

*** German and English Romanticism: parallel and cross-fertilising?

Too often Romanticism scholars are all over the map with theories. For
example, Andrea Wulf in her /Magnificent Rebels/ depicts Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe as a sort of adult-supervision den dad of the Jena
Set, and yet here is something he actually said about Romanticism

#+begin_quote
Klassisch ist das Gesunde, romantisch das Kranke ... or
... Romanticism is disease. It is the weak, the sickly, the battle cry
of a school of wild poets and Catholic reactionaries; whereas
classicism is strong, fresh, gay, sound, like Homer and the
/Nibelungenlied/.
#+end_quote

I won't accuse Wulf of poor research or intentional
obfuscation. Having been a founder of /Sturm und Drang/, Goethe might
have been of two minds. Perhaps he was initially attracted to all the
buzz around Jena, all the /haute pensée/ sprung up in his backyard,
but then soured on its content, implications, clashed with the
personalities behind it. Certainly Schiller did. Still, this is a
prime example of how diverse, even contradictory Romantic Era
scholarship can be.

To be sure, many contemporaries of the actual artistic producers
helped talk Romanticism into existence---the Jena Set, Coleridge,
Germaine de Staël, Emerson et al.---but again, I believe the actual
principals were far-sighted, inward-gazing, quasi-timeless unicorns
not following guidelines or living up to anybody's
expectations.[fn:113] ... and most certainly they did not "write to
spec" or pastiche, as was fairly obviously the case with gothic horror
novelists. /And so I say once more sifting through all the academic
chaff gets us nowhere versus simply reading and silently contemplating
the product itself./ All for naught is the listing facts, dates, and
figures, creating categories and pigeonholes, imagining commonalities,
generalities, throwing a formulaic hyperspace over my lone wolf
creators. Caveat emptor. If the purpose of a poem, as Keats said, is
to embolden the soul to accept mystery, then such analytical death
marches must be seen as counterproductive. For me at least, the
principals /re-sensitised/, while their describers and explainers have
only managed to /de-sensitise/ with their insensitive approach.

Some insight to this antagonism comes from two men of this era who
unfortunately wore both creator and explainer hats: Samuel Taylor
Coleridge and Edgar Allan Poe. With them we see their creations take
us into the ephemeral mists of Romanticism's subtleties and
sublimities, while their intellectualizations and pontifications
thereof only sound windy, if not shrill out to ridiculous.[fn:114] And
yet the urban salons of the time necessarily trafficked in rational,
left-brain talk and copy. And this is for me the /crisis of
Romanticism/, i.e., the huge divide between the creators and their
content versus their contemporary describers and promoters. And so I
say yes Mr Keats, we shall luxuriate long in the water, but then
slowly, gently swim back to the shore to gracefully and silently rise
out of the water and stand exulted for the whole experience. Of course
we cannot luxuriate in the lake forever, but upon exiting we must
somehow hold the experience in awe and reverence and not grasp for
logical explanations, which can only turn it into a show, a farce,
even so, a sham, a carcass.

Today a hit song or a TikTok video can go globally "viral" in less
than a day, with imitations instantly springing up like mushrooms
after rain. However, in the closing years of the eighteenth century
there just seemed to be something in the air, which, as noted earlier,
came to be called Romanticism, apparently first by Jena Set founder
Friedrich Schlegel[fn:115] The prima facie seeds were works from
Coleridge and Wordsworth's collaboration /Lyrical Ballads/ (first
edition) appearing in 1798 and Novalis' /HttN/ in 1800. And yet my
principle principal, Emily Brontë wrote decades later and arguably
knew very little if not absolutely nothing about Jena, Novalis---or
even much of Coleridge and Wordsworth other than perhaps a reading of
their /Lyrical Ballads/. Then later, Poe is said to have encountered
translations of Ludwig Tieck's short stories. Otherwise,
cross-fertilisation was a sketchy thing. For example, brother and
sister William and Dorothy Wordsworth spent some seven months in
Germany between 1898 and 1899, but were there only to save money and
perhaps learn German. They apparently had no idea of Novalis or Jena
Romanticism starting up at that time! 

What is called /Early German Romanticism/[fn:116] began when Novalis'
/HttN/ burst upon the scene in the very first year of the nineteenth
century. Clear to me, however, is that /HttN/ was a one-off that came
out of the blue, thus, certainly not intentional, positioned for, or
tailored to any specific trend or agenda. Contrast this with Goethe's
play /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Tauris_(Goethe)][Iphigenia in Tauris]]/ (versions in 1779, 1781, 1786), based on
Euripides' original and specifically meant to showcase Goethe's ideal
of modern classicism, i.e., his and Friedrich Schiller's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Classicism][Weimar
Classicism]].[fn:117] Enter the /Jena Set/, centred around the Schlegel
brothers, August Wilhelm and Friedrich, along with August's wife
Caroline, who seized upon the mostly absentee Novalis as their boy
wonder /Liebling/ mascot---and the conflation of producer and
describers began in earnest. But just one year after /HttN/ appeared,
Novalis died on them. Though the seed had sprouted and the Jena Set
went on to create an entire mountain range of Jena Romanticism which
had little to do with their boy-man hero Novalis' scattered utterances
and writings. After philosopher [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte][Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] fell out of
favour, the young, dynamic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling][Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]] came
on board, and it is his /nature philosophy/ which became Jena
Romanticism's house brand, eventually adopted and promoted by
Coleridge (sometimes as literal translation as in his [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographia_Literaria][Biographia
Literaria]] - 1817), then by Emerson and the Transcendentalists in the
Colonies. Again, all of this stamping and churning misses Dark
entirely! Thus, right from the start Dark is obscured behind a wall of
theorising and intellectualisations.

*** Poe and Dark Romanticism

/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Romanticism][Dark Romanticism]]/ (DR) would be an even more unfortunate academe box
for its containing the adjective dark. At its centre was supposedly
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe][Edgar Allan Poe]].[fn:118] Alas but the Wikipedia description of DR
trots out all the negative stereotypes of Dark. As one biographer
noted, Poe struggled all his short adult life to make a living as a
writer and poet. One supposed quote of his said

#+begin_quote
Your writer of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big
pen, with a very blunt nib.
#+end_quote

My take on Poe was that, as I said above, he led a Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde
literary existence. The American publishing world was rarely
supportive, as the biographer said, eager to move on from anything
gothic. And yet Poe always seemed to amaze and find audiences.

Poe's best known poem was /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven][The Raven]]/, which wound through the
publishing world---mainly periodicals and newspapers---throughout
1845, finally landing in a collection of Poe's poems in the summer
of 1845. And in my main twentieth century school children would learn
by heart at least the first stanza

#+begin_verse
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore---
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door---
            Only this and nothing more.”
#+end_verse

and if you were a good student, perhaps even the second stanza

#+begin_verse
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
            Nameless here for evermore.
#+end_verse

then of course /...’Tis the wind and nothing more.../ and other such
evocative snatches. For youth poetry reciting contests /The Raven/ has
been a standard. But through all this we have what is basically a
throwback to the doom-and-gloom Graveyard School gothic, i.e., not
informed by, e.g., Barbauld's finer sort of Dark.

Following /The Raven/ came Poe's fateful essay entitled /The
Philosophy of Composition/ wherein he attempted to reverse-engineer
what he did to come up with /The Raven/. Here's a portion

#+begin_quote
I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of
ill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word "Nevermore" at the
conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length
about one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object-
supremeness or perfection at all points, I asked myself, "Of all
melancholy topics what, according to the universal understanding of
mankind, is the most melancholy?"  Death, was the obvious reply. "And
when," I said, "is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?" From
what I have already explained at some length the answer here also is
obvious, "When it most closely allies itself to Beauty: The death then
of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the
world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for
such topic are those of a bereaved lover."
#+end_quote

Alas, but I just cannot accept that he created /The Raven/ on some
mechanised poetry conveyor belt, speaking of Death capitalised, then
death of a woman almost as if a gimmick. Again, alas. It gets worse

#+begin_quote
Most writers---poets in especial---prefer having it understood that
they compose by a species of fine frenzy---an ecstatic intuition---and
would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the
scenes, at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought, at the
true purposes seized only at the last moment, at the innumerable
glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view, at the
fully-matured fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable, at the
cautious selections and rejections, at the painful erasures and
interpolations---in a word, at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for
scene-shifting, the step-ladders, and demon-traps, the cock's
feathers, the red paint and the black patches, which, in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, constitute the properties of the literary
histrio [actor, player].
#+end_quote

Cringe. He sounds ashamed about falling into a state of "ecstatic
intuition," as if he is surrounded by peers around whom he had better
not sound too airy-floaty. Or maybe he wanted to say, "'Twas
nothing. Just follow my formula, and you too can write a nice, dark
poem that'll have them all weeping." Once more, cringe.

Personally, I do believe /The Raven/ came from something
ecstatic---out to trance and vision. Again, Poe was simply an erratic
character who seemed to change personalities often. But sometimes I
want /The Raven/ to be about the death of Romanticism. If academe says
the last breath escaped circa 1850, then perhaps I could read into the
lines a lamenting of the passing of an era symbolised by a beautiful,
virtuous woman Leanore . Allow me, please.

And so here I want to make a very important point about my principals,
to be sure, *that they were only vessels*, those particular mortals
the Muses chose to be their emissaries. This angle is well developed
in the Hollywood film /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)][Amadeus]]/ where Mozart[fn:119] was depicted as
an immature, outta-control brat and yet the conduit of heavenly
music. As alluded above, Novalis was likely just such a boy-wonder
Amadeus sort, Poe often enough mercurial, Emily Brontë austere
anorexic, Emily Dickinson a spinster recluse. Looking too closely into
their personal stories gets us no closer to discovering the origins of
their inspiration---in other words, another academe dead end. Consider
what the writer and artist Kahil Gibran said about children in his
/The Prophet/, i.e., they come /through/ you, they are not /of/ you.

Though Poe's own descriptions of his "place of creative origin" was
surprisingly insightful. He once mentioned the state of having
"thoughts behind thoughts." Which is something I found described in a
[[https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/neuregulin-1-genie-und-schizophrenie-moeglicherweise-folge-eines-gens-a-870089.html][/Der Spiegel/ article]] from 2012 about the link between creativity and
*schizophrenia*. Basically, an "expression" of the gene Neuregulin 1
(NRG1), which supposedly is key in regulating "synaptic plasticity"
can sometimes be amiss, but not so amiss that full-on schizophrenia
results. Instead of full debilitation with phantom voices and raging
paranoia, a "schizoid lite" sufferer will have the hidden underground
river of wild disassociated thoughts, but be able to control it, even
tap into it. Once I read this Der Spiegel article scales fell from my
eyes---it described me! Here is an example of a poem I wrote

#+begin_verse
Dark burgundy roses, cobalt irises
Delivered for the night's performance,
To the theatre in the hollow, */le théâtre de la combe/*.
Village-bound now, the hollow once a fairy circle,
Long since fairy dream haunted.
Look down from the sacred grove, now the square.
Recall the one attendance as a child:
Visions of darker, older nights since. 

Escape to the countryside;
Great sunlight to dispel dark fairy rumour.
Yet the pale blue sky but tissue, the thinnest canopy.
Indigo lace swirling, grey clouds, fog billowing.
Incessant winds to lift and shred the canopy
Till starless void revealed...

... darkness, and the chill wind rises up
The cobblestone /ruelle/ from the hollow.
On this night of many nights as one,
Dark purple clouds stripe a moon large and orange,
Placed just above /le théâtre de la combe/.
#+end_verse

As far as describing my creative process I remember becoming fixated
upon a nighttime scene of a narrow, winding, cobblestone,
other-century street and a small theatre therein. And the rest simply
came from the underground river of /thought rumour/ below my direct
consciousness. For further evidence I might add a section of my novel
/Emily of Wolkeld/. Here is Emily describing her special place

#+begin_quote
She gazed once more at the broken outline of Wolkeld Hall through the
trees, letting her concentration slip and her eyes glaze. She
listened after that strange place in her mind from which bits
and pieces of scenes played beyond her comprehension, where
shadows of thoughts never quite became clear. Though at times
something would suddenly stand before her and demand her best
attempt at a poetisation.

Since Kansas, since puberty, she would occasionally find herself
slipping into some further space beyond the secret compartments. But
again, she could only sense, partially comprehend this expansive,
twilit region, fleeting, but long dominating her heart and mind. At
first she considered such flights just intense day-dreaming, but over
time they became less imagined, more a definite communion with a
distinctly separate realm. It was a dusky world, steeped in sublime
melancholic loneliness, often large and panoramic. At first she found
it worrisome---not some clear religious transport of light and
ecstasy. And yet she came to believe good was speaking, not evil, nor
for that matter any sort of lurking mental illness. She wished it to
be something of her soul’s true home, perhaps some distant view of
Cumbria---at least that was the place to which she always mapped it,
for which she yearned immediately thereafter.

The queen of this sort of /Schizophrenia Lite™/ is of course Emily
Dickinson, whose lines often disappear into this underground
region. Reading her hundreds of little one-, two-, three-stanza bursts
leaves me certain she was definitely Schizo-lite™

#+begin_verse
A thought went up my mind to-day
That I have had before,
But did not finish, --- some way back,
I could not fix the year,

Nor where it went, nor why it came
The second time to me,
Nor definitely what it was,
Have I the art to say.

But somewhere in my soul, I know
I've met the thing before;
It just reminded me --- 't was all ---
And came my way no more.

Bright gems, one after the other, poured out of that terribly gentle,
unimaginably deep woman. Sigh...

Now, on to what I consider Poe's best poem, namely, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabel_Lee][Annabel Lee]]/

#+begin_verse
It was many and many a year ago,
   In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
   By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
   Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love---
   I and my Annabel Lee---
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
   Coveted her and me.

And this was the reason that, long ago,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
   My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsmen came
   And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
   In this kingdom by the sea.

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
   Went envying her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
   Of those who were older than we---
   Of many far wiser than we---
And neither the angels in Heaven above
   Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;

For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
   In her sepulchre there by the sea---
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.

If there is a better American example of the Dark Muse, I don't know
it. Here Poe is contemplative melancholic, rather than flogging fright
as he does in his prose. I wonder if Poe knew of Novalis and his
supposed one hundred nights of graveside vigilance for deceased Sophie
von Kühn? Perhaps, but irrelevant. Again, I suss out that both Poe and
Emily Brontë grasped the Dark Muse and found expression through their
poetry---but, again, so ironically, not through their prose where they
could only fall back into gothic. And so I fall back to poetry and
fragmented bursts as the only vehicle of true Dark.

I would add that Poe, of my principle principals, was undoubtedly the
best educated and informed. He would have known Greek mythology best,
i.e., all about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanatos][Thanatos]], Nyx, Hypnos, the Underworld and, in general,
the classic Greek proto-gothic take on death and night. And yet he
delivers in his /Annabel Lee/ our new sort of Dark Muse.[fn:120]

** All travesties aside...

#+begin_quote
The past is a witness that never speaks but never blinks. The guilty,
the sick of our era sense this and attack it, slander and distort
it.
#+end_quote

...so saith I, for during our era my principals have indeed been
grossly slandered and misrepresented. Read on...

What if we all went around completely misrepresenting each other,
saying outlandishly false things about whomever whenever? Enmity,
feuding, fisticuffs, the breakdown of society, perhaps even civil war
would ensue ... at the very least lawyers would get rich from all the
libel and slander lawsuits. But what if the people about whom we are
spewing pure calumny, making up whole-cloth fabrications are the long
since dead and seemingly have no champions? In today's Hollywood this
very fate has recently befallen my Bach and Mozart of poetry, Emily
Brontë and Emily Dickinson. But first, allow me to deal with a
particularly annoying critical review of /Jane Eyre/ by the
proto-feminist Virginia Woolf.

*** Virginia Woolf's modernist counteroffensive against /Jane Eyre/

Every era seems to latch onto some set of hyper-idealisms, our present
times the herculean task of idealising any sort of non-heterosexual,
transgender proclivities to the level of enlightenment, the bearers'
paths through life that of geniuses, prophets, martyrs, and saints. A
double hero for both gender-bending and modern realism literature is
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf][Virginia Woolf]] (1882 - 1941).[fn:121]

In the photo to the right I ask, do we see a long-suffering,
compassionate saintly person; or is this a cold, distant, insufferable
urbanite exuding emotional detachment and unavailability? Hard to say
from just a picture. Arguably irrelevant. In any event, she was a
late-Victorian, early-Edwardian intellectual and writer, a founding
member of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group][Bloomsbury Group]] of like-minded intellectuals and
artists. And it was in 1916 in her collected essays called /The Common
Reader/ that she critiqued /Jane Eyre/, as well as /Wuthering Heights/
along with their two authors Charlotte and Emily Brontë. And as I
posit, in so doing she could not have aligned herself more strongly
with the "don't get it" crowd.

Woolf is openly patronising and condescending of Charlotte

#+begin_quote
When we think of her [Charlotte Brontë] we have to imagine some one
who had no lot in our modern world; we have to cast our minds back to
the '50s of the last century, to a remote parsonage upon the wild
Yorkshire moors. In that parsonage, and on those moors, unhappy and
lonely, in her poverty and her exaltation, she remains for ever.
#+end_quote

No "lot" in the modern world? This /qualifies/ not disqualifies
Charlotte to tell me a story. It is having no "lot" in a natural,
organic world from which Woolf suffered. Then

#+begin_quote
She [Charlotte Brontë] does not attempt to solve the problems of human
life; she is even unaware that such problems exist; all her force, and
it is the more tremendous for being constricted, goes into the
assertion, "I love," "I hate," "I suffer."
#+end_quote

Indeed. And what problems of human life have ever been solved by
anyone living in a modern city? Cities, Ms Woolf, /are the problem/,
and any attempt at solving anything in a city is never more than the
momentary calming of a tempest in a teapot. But then Ms Woolf really
gets to it

#+begin_quote
In other words, we read Charlotte Brontë not for exquisite observation
of character---her characters are vigorous and elementary; not for
comedy---hers is grim and crude; not for a philosophic view of
life---hers is that of a country parson's daughter; but for her
poetry. Probably that is so with all writers who have, as she has, an
overpowering personality, so that, as we say in real life, they have
only to open the door to make themselves felt. There is in them some
untamed ferocity perpetually at war with the accepted order of things
which makes them desire to create instantly rather than to observe
patiently. This very ardour, rejecting half shades and other minor
impediments, wings its way past the daily conduct of ordinary people
and allies itself with their more inarticulate passions. It makes them
poets, or, if they choose to write in prose, intolerant of its
restrictions. Hence it is that both Emily and Charlotte are always
invoking the help of nature. They both feel the need of some more
powerful symbol of the vast and slumbering passions in human nature
than words or actions can convey. It is with a description of a storm
that Charlotte ends her finest novel /Villette/. "The skies hang full
and dark---a wrack sails from the west; the clouds cast themselves
into strange forms." So she calls in nature to describe a state of
mind which could not otherwise be expressed. But neither of the
sisters observed nature accurately as Dorothy Wordsworth observed it,
or painted it minutely as Tennyson painted it. They seized those
aspects of the earth which were most akin to what they themselves felt
or imputed to their characters, and so their storms, their moors,
their lovely spaces of summer weather are not ornaments applied to
decorate a dull page or display the writer's powers of
observation---they carry on the emotion and light up the meaning of
the book.
#+end_quote

I'm not sure how a person could be more clueless, more mistaken, or,
objectively put, more diametrically opposed to this sublimely artful
pinnacle of the Dark Muse. Woolf and her Bloomsbury friends were
certainly anti-Romanticism---as were all the cool kids by that time;
but in this passage her ignorance, intolerance, and general
cluelessness truly flashes brightly. First, saying Charlotte's prose
is poetic is not a failing as she insists, rather, great
achievement. Then to say Charlotte has an overpowering personality
leading her to impatiently throw out half-baked observations is
ludicrous. In addition, /Jane Eyre/ is all about the main protagonist
weaving in and out of the "accepted order of things," carving out a
place for herself against great counter forces and impediments. But
then the centrepiece of Woolf's criticism, namely, the accusation that
Charlotte and Emily are always "invoking the help of nature." Aaaagh!
Virginia, dear, /that's a feature not a bug!/ Here is a Woolf quote
from her gender-bender novel /Orlando: A Biography/

#+begin_quote
Green in nature is one thing, green in literature another. Nature and
letters [literature] seem to have a natural antipathy; bring them
together and they tear each other to pieces.
#+end_quote

Openly anti-nature, anti-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viriditas][viriditas]]? Coming from an androgynous,
brain-on-top-of-a-body urbanite, this is perhaps understandable. It
belies the frustration of a city-dweller existing in an artificial,
extra-natural cityscape with any sort of exposure to nature. To such
an unnatural creature as Woolf nature is a bother, an imposition, an
opponent, a source of contamination and impurity in a
hyper-controlled, pseudo-sterile environment completely expunged of
anything organic other than urban-dramaturgic humans, their servant
animals, and exactly controlled parks and gardens. Nature is
negatively superincumbent upon modern Homo sapiens sapiens, one might
conclude from Woolf...

Woolf is of course critical of the Brontëan use of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy][pathetic
fallacy]],[fn:122] a staple of Romantic Era writing. But again writers
of Woolf's era were quit any respect for the link between Nature and
man. They had moved on to what they considered more realistic
depictions of life. They were over clouds and winds blowing up moods,
distracting the complex human boil and bubble. Removing the human from
Nature made for a heady intensification of drama---which writers of
that time mistook for more humanist authentic. And yet all I see from
them and their ilk is mutations of human life, the caprice of conceit
creating snob appeal around existential meaninglessness, hopelessness,
absurdism.

Most assuredly Woolf cannot abide the attempted Brontëan inhabitation
of Nature. Whatever vestigial receptor sites we have for Nature, they
must be exposed exclusively to supposedly richer urban-sphere
chemistry. Charlotte has apparently blundered by "call[ing] in nature
to describe a state of mind which could not otherwise be expressed."
What other vehicle of expression should there be? Woolf makes the
ridiculous criticism of saying storms, moors, lovely spaces of summer
weather should only be "ornaments applied to decorate a dull page or
display the writer’s powers of observation." She says the use of
Nature to "carry on the emotion and light up the meaning of the book"
is bad writing. And then claiming William Wordsworth's sister Dorothy
was a more accurate observer of nature. Really? Dorothy Wordsworth was
through-and-through a nature-based Romanticist. Although mainly
unpublished, she was a soul in lockstep with her brother. And so my
takeaway is the more shade, the more attempts at discrediting the
Brontës Woolf made, the more obvious who the wiser was.

Allow me something I found by just opening /Emily Brontë The Complete
Poems/ to a random page

#+begin_verse
O evening, why is thy light so sad?
Why is the sun's last ray so cold?
Hush! our smile is as ever glad,
But my heart is growing old.

It's over now; I've known it all;
I'll hide it in my heart no more,
But back again that night recall,
And think the fearful vision o'er.

The evening sun in cloudless shine
Has passed from summer's heaven divine,
And dark the shades of twilight grew,
And stars were in the depth of blue

And in the heath or mountain far
From human eye and human care,
With thoughtful thought and tearful eye,
I sadly watched that solemn sky.
#+end_verse

The /reminiscence/ of Nature having made the emotion bundle for a
lifetime vibrate is a precious gift indeed. The narrator's emotions
float upon, are embedded in Nature. A real human being has exactly
this sort of experience: Life and Nature mean something when
interwoven. Simply put, the Brontës were beholden unto Nature and
God. They beseeched Nature and God,[fn:123] and thus came back with
blessings in the form of lines such as these. And so I cannot allow
Woolf, nor any other city-bound modernist clone-bunnies, to cancel my
ladies' artistic licenses. Modern realists like Woolf are
self-condemned to a mental and emotional poverty for refusing the
miraculousness---however sublime or terrible---of Nature and our
fantastical membership therein. Ironic how so-called urban realists
are nearly all "reformists" out to radical socialists, always wanting
to improve mankind's lot, many following deterministic Marxist
dialectic scripts.[fn:124] And yet they cannot see how /no one knows
what to do with this Industrial Era!/---not the absentee capitalists
on one side, not the socialists on the other. No one knows how the
human is supposed to ever thrive in these alien, hostile, sterile
urban hell zones---however decorated this or that corner may be with
classical tinsel.[fn:125] /Früher war mehr Lamella/, or, "before there
was more tinsel," indeed.

*** Modern attacks on the Amherst and Haworth Emilies

If Virginia Woolf was wrong out to downright silly, she was just a
beginner at literary defamation. The travesties I now mean are the
intentionally anachronistic misrepresentations of my two main
principals, i.e., the two Emilies, Brontë and Dickinson, specifically
in the form of the AppleTV+ series /Dickinson/ (2019) and the
Hollywood film /Emily/ (2022). The need to correct these serious
crimes against culture and history is another reason I have initiated
my WutheringUK effort.

Both /Dickinson/ and /Emily/ are completely cringe unwatchable, but
worse by far is the mutilation of Emily Dickinson unfolding in the
three-season, thirty episode AppleTV+ series /Dickinson/. Apparently,
the real Amherst Emily said something affectionate in a letter to a
female friend---which opened the door for creator and screenwriter
Alena Smith to flip typical nineteenth-century platonic[fn:126] to
sexual and reinvent the shy, gentle, reclusive, proto-nerd-girl
homebody Emily Elizabeth as a brassy, bratty, boorish, snarky,
completely desensitised and masculinised, hyper-sexual, outta-control,
protest-lesbian champion against the patriarchy. This period porn,
this cultural hooliganism went on for three years, spread over thirty
episodes of crashing, rebel-poser effrontery, even winning a Peabody,
among other, "awards." The wincing Wikipedia article which categorises
it as a "comic-drama" says

#+begin_quote
/Dickinson/ is notable for its use of anachronisms, incorporating
modern language, music, and references into its portrayal of
historical events and figures.
#+end_quote

...quite possibly the understatement of all time. It also states
/Dickinson/ is "a window into the cultural and political climate of
the time." Really? Quite a dirty, distorting window. It is nothing of
the sort, rather, an entire reinvention based on radical, male-hating,
misanthropic, twenty-first-century agitprop feminism, full
stop. Again, if conspiracy theories about Cultural Marxism[fn:127] were ever
to be taken serious, this would be Exhibit A. Not only is Emily
Dickinson trashed, they also trash other big names of the American
Romantic Era. Sample [[https://youtu.be/3tO8ol9j34s?si=DQifICJs3tJgpi9O][this]] nonsense about Poe, then [[https://youtu.be/LmneLDB6hAI?si=sSef_hvjshiTbV1b][this]] craziness
about Thoreau. Crrringe... And just when you thought it couldn't get
worse [[https://youtu.be/pFp05alGLow?si=tTk-5CPhmpdkeQ3R][this music video]] performed by the actress portraying Emily
Dickinson is attached to the series as its supposed theme
song. Alas... This is nothing less than a frontal assault on an icon
of Western culture, and I don't like it.

#+end_export

More innocuous perhaps because it is a single film lasting only two
hours, thus, not able to get up to as much evil and inanity as
/Dickinson/, is the 2022 Hollywood /Emily/,[fn:128] depicting Emily
Brontë, the woman I consider the greatest, deepest English-language
poet, as a clumsy, oafish maladroit, stumbling around in a completely
anachronistic period fantasy chaos. Enough said.

I hemmed and hawed over this bit of electron savagery, but seriously,
there can be /zero/ buy-in to this sort of nonsense if we are to get
anywhere near understanding the true nature of these special
people. To get, to grok my principals we must suspend any and all
revisionist wishful thinking nonsense. We can't just have actors
donning excellent period costumes---only to carry on like today's
vapid, degenerate urban hipsters. We have to accept, work with the
world they inhabited, warts and all. /They are not our pets./ And even
if we could go back in time and meet our chosen unicorns, we would
probably not become their friends. In my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ my
modern Emily is playing the tourist in today's tourist-trap Haworth
and imagines an encounter with classic Emily

#+begin_verse
She wondered anew what Emily Brontë would have thought had she walked by at that moment. Modern Emily would have stared beseechingly at original Emily---and no doubt original Emily would have been duly affronted.

“Miss, are you going out to the falls this day? May I come along? I do not wish to be alone in the countryside,” modern Emily might call after her hero.

And fitting the heaviness of the air, the blankness of the thinly clouded, washed-out blue sky above, classic Emily would flatly reply, “Yes, I am going there, but I can suffer no strange company. Good day.”
#+end_verse

Right. I can imagine Haworth Emily of yore as being quite curt,
abrupt, protective of her privacy, in short, anti-social. Again,
making a personality cult out of our heroes from the past, however
sensational as we may now see them, is a big mistake.

Indeed, hacks, polemicists are forever appropriating some defenceless
figure from the past to reimagine as their pets. And so any gifted
unicorn from yesteryear who might have chafed even the least bit at
society's eternal(ly shifting, reforming) containment fields is
reintroduced, reconstituted as some proto-revolutionist. Ghost
rustling, I call this. Forshame.

*** It's not all bad: the 2011 /Jane Eyre/, the 2009 /Bright Star/

Contrast with the 2011 /Jane Eyre/ where the hipster modernist
triumphalist nonsense is kept to a minimum. In this umpteenth filming
of the Charlotte Brontë classic, there are two actual Christian prayer
scenes! I urge everyone to watch this gem. Likewise, /Bright Star/
mentioned above from Australian director/producer Jane
Champion. Still, these are modern screen verisimilitude, which cannot
and does not capture much other than a sweet vibe. A cup of tea on a
chill, wet twilight, and to sit down and watch one or the other...

<span class="cap">Mia Wasikowska as Jane Eyre</span>
#+end_export

Of course the audio-visual medium of film is fraught. First and
foremost, we must accept the social-political landscape of those
times. Christianity for one simply was a given in my principals'
lives. It was their metaphysical foundation and was largely accepted
by both Emilies, indeed, as I've said, so often poetised.

Today we shamble about in a political fog where the Left will not
believe anything good about the past, and the Right will not brook
anything bad about some golden era in their limited imaginations. The
Left, however, is arguably everything Noam Chomsky had to say about
French nihilism, and the Right an amalgamation of conservative and,
newly, libertarianism.[fn:129]

** My time in the Old-world West

Let me once again touch on the Eastern mysticism so prevalent
today. Again, I must reject /western/ Eastern, and for that matter,
all other appropriated multiculturalism mash-ups. I hold to
"Anglo-Indian" Rudyard Kipling's advice

#+begin_quote
Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet...
#+end_quote

...Kipling, who, as the Wikipedia articles says, "Complex issues of
identity and national allegiance would become prominent in his
fiction." My Dark Muse doesn't need anything complex from afar.

There is something instinctual in my rejection of all things Eastern
as a Dark Muser of German, English, and Scottish ancestry.[fn:130]
Firstly, I need Dark to originate from Nature's very own Dark
base. Anyway, I could not imagine a set of people more the antithesis
of Dark and Nature than Buddhists, Taoists, Hindus...

But why are Eastern culture and belief systems so popular today,
especially with so many bright, sensitive seekers in the West? To
which I might flippantly reply, Because they don't really understand
Dark---at least as I'm presenting it here. Seriously though, Eastern
belief systems are universalist, which supposedly make them applicable
to all of humanity. But I say this is right from the start a
disqualifier. Universal is homogenising, which breaks down the
specificity and potency of local, real-time involvement and attachment
to a place, Nature, and any true spirituality that may arise. The fact
that Buddhism may be practiced, e.g., a mediation retreat may happen
in a wild /or/ in a modern glass, steel, and concrete urban setting is
a clear red flag that we're dealing with something disconnected and
artificial.

Though Eastern would seem to offer an Old World perspective we
especially in the Western Hemisphere, the New World have never really
known but instinctively feel we must somehow find. Old World versus
New World: Allow me to use the analogy of vector spaces to describe
what I see as the main difference. I contend the Western Hemisphere
only knows the /three dimensions/ of regular, everyday space, while
the Eastern Hemisphere---Europe, Africa, the Middle East, India, the
Far East---knows /four dimensions/, the fourth being Einstein's time
dimension. In this context, time means history where, in turn, /real/
culture may be found. The Western Hemisphere, however, has no real
time dimension, thus, relatively speaking, no history, which leaves a
phantom-limb-like pain in our collective psyches. Indeed, great
historical vectors in this four-space may still be found in certain
corners of the Old World. Yes, the Buddhism,[fn:131] Taoism, Hinduism
of the Far East draw us in with their seemingly four-space depth and
vibrancy. And yes, I very much believe the human ultimately needs true
culture and yearns to be in this four-dimensional space. But Eastern
mysticism fails us Westerners. Now for the story behind this theory...

Back in 1982 I was working and studying at the Swiss Polytech in
Zürich, Switzerland, living in a small Zürich student dormitory among
mainly Europeans, most of whom were, oddly enough, German
students.[fn:132] One March evening a group of us found ourselves
watching the American Oscar awards ceremony on television. Of course
it was all very cringe embarrassing for me the only American, the
whole spectacle very America-centric, bombastic and off-putting. But
to my surprise the conversation that ensued was not the usual
anti-American spleen-venting, rather, a very mature, objective
discussion as to why the Hollywood entertainment industry was so big
and powerful and influential, indeed, so dominant and important that
its film awards ceremony would be shown on prime-time Swiss
television. Scales fell from my eyes as my Eastern Hemisphere colleges
came up with the basis of this three- versus four-dimension
theory. The verdict was Americans---lacking true history, and thus,
real culture---devote their attention, energy, brain cycles to a very
fierce and intense scramble to control and dominate the present
moment, the here-and-now. And so controlling the Zeitgeist was all
that mattered, all that was left in our three-dimensional space, /the
results being just so much meaningless churn, come-and-go subculture
of little or no permanence/. I can't say for certain, but that might
have been when I also began to see /western/ Eastern as just another
appropriation to fill our New World void. It was shortly after this
when I met up with an old American friend I had known from college
back in Illinois. He had recently been at some Eastern monastery and
studied under some supposedly renowned guru. But the life seemed to
rush out of our friendship when he tried to explain how wonderful it
all was. And I turned a cold shoulder when he tried to convince me to
join him at some Swiss retreat centre.[fn:133] Alas, I was clearly
changed.

Ever since this revelation and other similar Saul-to-Paul moments,
ever since returning from my all but total assimilation into
especially the German mindset, I've been out of synch with my country
of origin.[fn:134] Recognising that most of our American mindset and
behaviors are really only lowest-common-denominator Zeitgeist
wrangling and subculture churn, augmented by exotic, esoteric cultural
appropriations, I've come to cleave to the permanence I encountered in
the Eastern Hemisphere, specifically Europe, the home of my
ancestors. Call me /Eurocentric/ and I'll smile. But again, this
traditionalism, this Old World mentality clashes mightily with the
common American relativist attitude, i.e., /culture is whatever we say
it is/. And who gets to say what it is here in the USA? To be sure,
the strong, domineering personalities who have climbed the greasy
poles of media gatekeeping and influence control. And so I see strong
minds around me floundering for lack of that fourth dimension, trying
desperately to finish a jigsaw puzzle where most of the pieces are
missing and the supposed end-picture is unknown. At some point pieces
are cut and mangled to force some abstraction into view. Then begins
the PR battle against all the other abstractions for
acceptance. Alas...

1984 saw the release of the film /Amadeus/ and, again, a big
discussion took off in my Zürich dorm. Surprising for me, the attitude
of the Europeans was thumbs down. And, once again, I had a road to
Damascus[fn:135] moment as I learned another huge New World versus Old
World difference, namely, that when the film's supposedly mean,
repressive Emperor Joseph II complained of "[[https://youtu.be/H6_eqxh-Qok?si=NCTGZKyn_BzTI9b1][too many notes]]," he was
simply voicing a typically age-old /stasis/ attitude. Of course
musicologists can say exactly what the tastes were back then, but my
Old Worlders explained how an Austrian emperor of that time was in
charge of a land and society where capitalism, high-tech mass
consumerism, any sort of dynamic modernist ideals were unknown. That
is to say, /theirs was a reality predicated upon maintaining balance
and stasis/. Why?  Simply put, in their relatively closed
resource-and-energy system, human behavior must conform to, be
compatible with the real-world resource and energy constraints of that
system. And so in 1780s Austria all manner of "progress" had to be
measured against what it may ultimately cost, what it might
upset.

Stasis, for any growth reverberations tended to positive
feedback.[fn:136] This was my introduction to what /monarchism/ really
was about---totally overthrowing my American and Hollywood
indoctrination whereby aristocrats were depicted as ridiculously
selfish, hedonistic despots.[fn:137] Real monarchism, as it was at
last explained to me, is first and foremost concerned with the
management of resources, i.e., resource conservation, the old-fashion
term for environmentalism ... and all other human behaviour then
following in their pre-fossil-fuel, pre-industrialist,
pre-imperialist, pre-high-tech reality. /Nature controls, Nature
informs, and we must follow/. Once again new sight from eyes
de-scaled. From then on I saw monarchism in a new light. Monarchism as
stasis maintenance made brilliant sense! Contrast this with our modern
Hollywood fantasy Mozart who is the heroic revolutionist overthrowing
stuffy old conventions to boldly strike out into new territory for the
benefit of all. To be sure, I had grown up believing nothing should
impede freedom and liberty, new ideas replacing old. Everywhere should
be unbridled individualism über alles. But as I learned there was
another side to the story...

I can now sum up my attitude about monarchism---yes, I'm a
monarchist---with a joke about God and the devil meeting in their
favourite pub and having a beer. One evening at the pub the devil was
all excited about his "new ideas" for humanity. He told God about
/democracy/ and how grand it would be. God, however, was skeptical
and, pulling his long beard, asked, "Hmmm, so what does this democracy
do for a living?" The devil became even more animated, "Oh, oh, my
/second/ new idea, capitalism!"  ... which he proceeded to
explain. God, however, grumbled about how they did not sound better
than monarchism, that it was probably just another ploy to win more
souls away from heaven...

These foundations of the Old World have been very slowly developing
like the old-fashioned film in my head. And so here I am, almost to my
seventh decade on this earth, an Old-World Luddite monarchist. As I
now see it, our modern, open-ended resource and energy extraction orgy
cannot go on much longer. Really though, how can more and more people
consuming more and more resources and energy keep going much longer?
Perhaps for a few more giddy generations, but certainly the bill is
coming due. At some point no amount of Elon Musk's or Bill Gates'
high-tech white-knighting will keep us kicking this profligate
resource consumption whale down the beach. This means a very different
way of life must soon be found---or more likely, re-discovered. I now
have my own proto/pre-paleoconservatism---all stemming from, based
upon the resource conservation reality we face, we have always faced
on this planet. And yet we in the twenty-first century find ourselves
in humanity's most precarious state ever, due mainly to our science
and technology ingenuity creating a false sense of immortal
invincibility, not to mention the false narrative of /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornucopianism][cornucopia]]/ or
eternal growth. Apparently, I'm the only one who sees the parallels of
reckless liberalisation of resource consumption to the liberalisation
of society, which likewise is showing clear signs of degeneracy and
dysfunctionality. One aphorism might be

#+begin_quote
The bigger the dance floor, the wilder and crazier the dancing.
#+end_quote

We in America have certainly created the biggest dance floor the world
has ever seen (resource- and personal freedoms-wise), and our
politicians, whether Left or Right, make endless promises of *freedom*
and *liberty* and *prosperity*, the /Three Illusions/ as I call them,
that is, how they will keep expanding the dance floor. I mean to make
a break with this madness starting with clearing out one of the most
ridiculous of these western Eastern attitudes, namely, the borrowed
and twisted idea of "live-in-the-moment mindfulness," which to me is
just the latest product on the modern /boutique lifestyle/ shelf. What
does "live in the moment" mean to the typical American? It means don't
worry about the consequences of wasteful, as well as immoderate
behaviour, and don't let the past inform or constrain you, either. And
to this decadent populace the political salesmen come with their
soft-soap lines.

*** A way out

Again, we sorely miss the fourth dimension of culture and history, and
we certainly all crave authenticity in this faceless, soulless modern
mass society---and yet we seem to find only fake knock-offs in the
various Old World philosophies and paradigms, western appropriations
to be peddled at the American lifestyle boutique. Alas. *I insist one
may not simply drop his past, his fate, his doom to take up with some
exotic culture, aesthetics, belief system not of his own soil, not of
his blood and history.* I realise this is a serious, restrictive "stay
in your lane" way of seeing life, but one becoming clearly necessary
for our physical and psychological survival.

My Dark Muse says life is life, not just any mix-and-match lifestyles
one may fancy from near and far. And yes, everything I've ever seen
appropriated from afar, especially from the East, is typically nothing
more than come-and-go fads flogged by would-be trend-setters. Worse,
we now see what some are calling /Cultural Marxism/,[fn:138] i.e., a
seemingly intentional eviscerating our traditions and Western
culture. The crypto-rebel chic pose has now joined spiritually
emasculating pacifist seekerdom, causing even more erosion of our
Western traditions. Today more than ever it has become fashionable,
even great virtue to ditch one's own traditions and try another's in
some misguided show of moral support. We see this /virtue signalling/
as atonement for complicity in past racist, imperialist sins. "Look at
me, I'm not Western, I'm /<insert politically-correct theatrics
here>/."  But how does this really help? It doesn't. At all.

With Western culture and traditions on the run, we are encouraged to
be multi-racial and especially multi-cultural, treating the globe's
non-Western faire like so many exotic dishes at a great pot luck to
which we, of course, do not bring anything from our own
kitchen.[fn:139] And so I ask, How can such a cultural mooch as the
Western modern leftist be trusted?  Already, the rest of the world no
longer trusts us.

Again, I'm especially against western Eastern because it has made the
most inroads into my society and attempted to obviate our age-old
traditions.[fn:140] My Dark Muse is simply incompatible with all the
borrowing from foreign, exotic places. I will not throw away my
history and traditions, for in them is my reality, my inescapable
*doom*. The way of the Universe is entropy, and we humans realise this
as doom. Yes, *I have doom, I have fate. I do /not/ have karma*. And
this doom is comprised of the strands of my actual history, and most
importantly, my emotion braid reaching back into the past. I therefore
own, I embody sins, failures, misfortune, but also yearnings and
longings and their cultural icon manifestations. I carry all I have
done, inherit all from which I have come down. *Facing doom and fate
means I must live down, I must live on, and I must live within---the
past, my life's destiny, and Nature, necessarily locally.*

"But you appropriate. You drink tea, and you're a Christian, and what
about spices and tobacco and opium and rubber and..." someone might
counter. Yes, yes, yes; however, some of these "imports" have stood
the test of time becoming westernised. Though truly some should be
dropped. Exotic is always suspect. But yes, I can say we've
westernised Christianity, made it our own. This will annoy many, but I
insist Christianity is /not/ a universalist, drop-in belief system,
but necessarily becomes interwoven with, shaped by the people and
their land. In /Jane Eyre/ Charlotte Brontë makes this very clear in
her criticisms of St John Rivers who thinks he must become a
missionary to India, instead of just staying in his little moorland
village and being spiritual shepherd to his flock. Charlotte portrays
Pastor St John as an aloof, emotionally anorexic, hyper-idealistic,
theology-bound, and all but an accessory to British
imperialist. Indeed, I see a much different take on Christian belief
through many of the nineteenth century poets, Christina Rossetti and
the Brontës. And no, I cannot gainsay them; rather, I try to
understand their unique and subtle understanding of
Christianity. Local, responsive, poetised Christianity versus
abstract, idealised, universalist "export" Christianity.

Are there things we in the West can learn from the East?
Irrelevant. I say western Eastern is a slippery slope we need to stay
off of completely. I contend we can never truly know Eastern beyond
hearsay, beyond our cherry-picking idealisations. Alone that the vast
majority of us having no actual experience with the real India or Far
East, culturally, genetically, geographically should be warding off
enough. And I especially reject the prima facie tourist's encounter,
even extended-stay tourism. If Kipling was confused, how can we today
do better? Indeed, the examples of the British Empire and all those
Englishmen supposedly "gone bush" in those far-flung exotic
places---T.E. Lawrence in Arabia, the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj][British Raj]] on the Indian
Subcontinent, as well as other far-flung places are warning signs to
stay clear.[fn:141] /Diametrically-opposed worlds do not enrich one
another, rather, they grind against one another./ Yes, today's educated
Indians can speak English, but I see little of real British culture
that has lasted there; more rather, India has thrown off British
imperialism like a bad cold.[fn:142] Alas, but this whole pan-humanist
empathic "we're all one people" homogenisation campaign will go on,
but the great retreat has begun.[fn:143]

And now it's time to discuss Protestant Calvinism, a very cold shower
indeed on the warm, fuzzy western Eastern.

*** Reformed Christianity versus Buddhist enlightenment

One glaring difference between East and West can be seen in the
Calvinist Reformed Protestant beliefs of what the human can know of
God---which is, as the Protestants would fatalistically say, not very
much. To Calvinists, God is infinite---and finite humans are incapable
of comprehending such an infinitude, full stop. Contrast this with the
Eastern concept of enlightenment, i.e., a human reaching some
quasi-God-like state. In Protestant Christianity there is no "higher
state" while on earth. For example, hard-core Protestant would never
acknowledge some master or guru having more spiritual maturity than a
novice. Pastor, bishop, and layman alike are equally deficient, i.e.,
a bishop may claim social, but never spiritual superiority over a
church member. Thus, we have the deep Protestant fatalism of how we
are all sinners in the eyes of God landing with a thud at our
feet.[fn:144] Protestantism insists we may know God only through
scripture---and then only through the proverbial glass darkly.[fn:145]

Indeed, this huge gradient between human and supreme being, which,
again, is diametrically opposed to Eastern enlightenment---satori,
nirvana. Case in point, the Reformation pointedly rejected the
Catholic metaphysics of sainthood whereby thousands supposedly had
miraculous spiritual experiences. Protestantism has few if any saints,
i.e., no spiritual mezzanine. Rarely does /Saint/ preface a disciple
or apostle. All metaphysics is contained in the Bible, and nothing
supernatural or mystical since is acknowledged.

Protestant belief is clearly more deterministic than Roman
Catholic. From the Wikipedia article on [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin][Original Sin]]

#+begin_quote
Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther and John Calvin equated
original sin with /concupiscence/ (or "hurtful desire"), affirming that
it persisted even after baptism and completely destroyed freedom to do
good, proposing that original sin involved a loss of free will except
to sin.
#+end_quote

Bottom line: We are fallen and banished from the Garden until further
notice. Our mortal coil, our mortality, sinfulness, and waywardness is
our prison-like reality while on earth. Which means any attempt at
climbing up the sides of life's Container is futile. And herein lies a
stasis mentality at the spiritual belief level, a holding pattern at
this grossly lower state of mortal life---at least until the Second
Coming of Christ.

I must admit my Dark Muse resonates with this doomy sort of
Christianity, while everything else has nothing for my Dark Muse. With
Calvinism my Dark seems built-in, for example,

#+begin_quote
Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. \\

Biblical anthropology says this refers to why childbirth is so
painful, even deadly for us. Undeniably, the West is Judaeo-Christian,
and the Bible, with its half-Jewish scriptural history, half-Jesus and
post-Jesus hagiography, contains large amounts of woe and suffering,

#+begin_quote

hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. \\

In the Book of Job I take the lesson, the admonishment that /we are no
better off than Job/. I then build out by saying /we are not better
than anyone/ of any past era simply for being concomitant with modern
scientific discovery and mass high-tech materialism. Yes, biblical
characters may sound like ignorant, superstitious hicks; but then I
ask, are we truly any better, any different just for sitting on our
modern perches? My answer is

#+begin_quote

---Matthew 16:26
#+end_quote

or, less Christian preachy, What do we get from modernism and
high-technology, from our huge, liberalised dance floor if these
great, wonderful boons wind up destroying our minds, our hearts, and
the good green Earth around us? I have come to despair at this
pervasive attitude that through evermore modern high-tech materialism
in these urban space-colony-like settings we are getting anywhere
close to any sort of self-realisation. We certainly are not! In fact,
we are slipping backwards into a collective madness as the earth
begins to fall into environmental disaster. What then to do?  I
contend Emily Brontë, my little "at-risk" bat eking out her living,
gained a clue, /one precious clue/.

** Emily Brontë's (unintended) worldview

#+begin_verse
Normie girl: Do you *always* have to wear black?
Goth girl: I'll stop wearing black when I find something *darker*.
#+end_verse

Here I will simply and plainly state (gush) that Emily Jane Brontë is
the very centre of my Dark Muse. Through just a handful of her poems
she embodies for me the heart and soul of what I consider /base/ Dark
and /real/ Romanticism. But as mentioned above, she has largely been
left out of any Romanticism boxing or packaging.[fn:146]

Though many are surprised when I say forget her book /Wuthering
Heights/, which for me is just old-school gothic handle-cranking,
however artistically potent we may find it.[fn:147] I said this
before---and, yes, it may seem odd and counter-intuitive---but prose,
loaded down with depictions of mundanity as it must be, is doomed, as
it simply cannot do for Dark what poetry can.[fn:148] Likewise, Poe
lost much altitude when he switched from poetry to prose---however
much fame he might have won from his short stories. I insist Brontë
and Poe said deep and lasting things about the Dark Muse in their
lyric verse, but really only added pulp to the gothic shelf with their
storytelling. Again, I insist gothic is a second-hand derivative, a
Platonic cave shadow of true Dark. Yes, blasphemy to many of you, but
as always, YMMV, your mileage may vary...

Of course there's no denying the human being is very
narrative-oriented, we crave /original time/ mythology, for
example. But a telling, a story must be of legend import and
gestalt;[fn:149] otherwise, it runs the risk of being confusing,
misleading, that is to say /false/ legend, exciting our psychic legend
receptor sites, stirring up archetypes only to lead us hither and
thither, in the end doing us no real service for all the innervation
... which eventually can only lead to burnout and collective
madness.[fn:150] What?! Really? Yes! And from where did such a crazy
idea come? From a Native American on the Blackfoot Reservation many
years ago who adamantly insisted his people's traditional legends were
true and not just children's fairy tales. He insisted[fn:151] our
white-man science was pointless and told us nothing worth knowing,
and, worse!, that our fictional novels, plays, and films were /false
legends/, and that we were a bunch of hapless, delusional fools
chasing after false legends![fn:152] Not kidding. But as has often
happened in my life, scales fell from my eyes, lights blinked on,
connections and eurekas (to this day) ensued.

One quick in-place aside indulgence, s'il vous plaît: It is terribly
ironic how we would never have known Emily Brontë's poetry had not big
sister Charlotte pilfered her manuscripts from their hiding place and
published them without Emily's permission. Similarly, the reclusive
Emily Dickinson only saw some ten poems published, but after her death
/over a seventeen hundred/ were discovered in her room and
subsequently published. And so I wonder, how many Barbaulds, Brontës,
Dickinsons, Poes fell back under the waves never to be known? As with
so many like Amherst and Haworth Emilies, we found them, they didn't
really find us. Alas.

Let me restart by saying Haworth Emily combined in her /poetry/

+ *Nature*,
+ *Dark*, and
+ *Christianity*

though in keeping with Keats' /Negative Capability/, no one or two
overshadowed the other two or one. Let's imagine a doughty frontier
one-room school teacher who forces the rowdy peasant boys, Dark,
Nature, and Christianity, indeed, of blood-feuding families, to sit
next to each other on the school bench and work together. And so I
urge you to simply get the Penguin Classics /Emily Brontë The Complete
Poems/ and read and read and never stop reading Haworth Emily over and
over. And in so doing you will hopefully be able to construct this
magical Negative Capability suspension of Nature, Dark, and
Christianity above your own heart and mind. Problematic, however, is
how some forty-four of her poems[fn:153] are referencing her [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracosm][paracosm]],
her fantasy land /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondal_(fictional_country)][Gondal]]/, and without any surviving backstory they
are obscure and cannot really be fathomed today.[fn:154] Still, the
remaining poems are gold. I will now single out three key (non-Gondal)
poems[fn:155]

+ /The night is darkening round me/ (once more),
+ /I'll come when thou art saddest/ and
+ /I would have touched the heavenly key/

which appear together as poem 31. in /The Complete Poems/ as a good
start to understanding the Brontëan West Yorkshire moorland philosophy
of life

#+begin_verse
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow;
But a tyrant spell has bound me
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow,
And the storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below;
But nothing drear can move me—
I will not, cannot go.

---

I'll come when thou art saddest,
Laid alone in the darkened room;
When the mad day's mirth has vanished,
And the smile of joy is banished
From evening's chilly gloom.

I'll come when the heart's real feeling
Has entire unbiased sway,
And my influence o'er thee stealing,
Grief deepening joy congealing,
Shall bear thy soul away.

Listen 'tis just the hour,
The awful time for thee;
Dost thou not feel upon thy soul
A flood of strange sensations roll,
Forerunners of a sterner power,
Heralds of me?

---

I would have touched the heavenly key
That spoke alike of bliss and thee;
I would have woke the entrancing song,
But its words died upon my tongue.
But then I knew that he stood free,
Would never speak of joy again,
And then I felt ... 
#+end_verse

Hmm ...  just more of that strangely antique-sounding blah-blah from
back then... And so you may wonder why I assign such importance to
these lines, how they could contain an entire philosophy. As I've said
before, I believe Emily Brontë, being such a marginal, hard-pressed
bat-like creature was singularly qualified to speak to us today. She
being introverted, marginal, unassuming, and yet fiercely determined,
stood during those short years of her life (no doubt unwittingly) at
the nexus of a perfect storm of perfect storms history-,
social-psychological-, and culture-wise.

I spoke above of /The night is darkening round me/ (as well as her
/All creation is equally mad.../ quote), and I reiterate that in this
one poem she holds the Dark Muse so very well. First, she is dealing
directly with natural, /source/ Dark, and not just packaging icons,
prompts, or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasmagoria][phantasmagoric]] symbols thereof. She writes with
subservience to, in total awe of this phenomenon of descending, stormy
darkness. She owns being small, insignificant, overwhelmed,
overpowered. And yet this is not the fatalist resignation of gothic,
not doom or woe-is-me. Nor is this the serene reflection of Night
School Barbauld, or even her own lauding then lamenting voice in
/Stars/. Nor is she reverent per se, which dominates the last two
poems. Instead, she attests to being held stationary by something
beyond feeling, beyond her control. She describes a powerful liminal
space created naturally by darkness descending while a storm rages,
wherein she discovers a vast mystery and sublimity---perhaps some
deeper understanding of her place in Nature. Darkness coming down upon
the wild, natural setting transports her, calls out and speaks to her
real self, presenting not just a fleeting /presence of eternal
harmony/ moment, rather, contact with a /*world* of eternal
mystery/. And yes, that world is Dark.

As discussed above, much of Romantic Era poetry is the basic
Wordsworthian homage to Nature, i.e., episodes of swooning over,
riffing on, paying compliments to an outdoor scene, e.g., Wordsworth's
/Tintern Abbey/. Emily, however, has been arrested, even rendered lame
by a harsh and threatening Nature's immediate effect and commanding
presence symbolised as a tyrant's spell. And being so much under this
tyrant's spell /belies a crisis/. A liminal phase phenomenon[fn:156]
has overthrown her mundane, rational human regimen to accost her mind
and soul with something of the incompatible beyond.

Indeed, if she were truly marginal and bat-like, not so very anchored,
not so bought into the "real," mundane world, if she had /shunned the
common paths that other run/,[fn:157] then this twilight storm across
the proximate wastelands would surely have confronted her with a
compelling alternative to the profane, real world. Instead of an
"everywhere," mappable and ultimately dominated by humans, she
glimpses an "everywhen" rooted in the eternal. It would seem Emily's
"God of Visions" has blessed her. And so we have this everywhen rumour
of some higher world whereof the frail, enthralled narrator may only
catch glimpses is presented so compellingly in this short,
three-stanza lyrical poem. Similar to Keller's /Winter Evening/
described above, we may then wonder how the observer will proceed in
life, so taken as she describes the encounter.

*** Von Droste-Hülshoff's versus Brontëan Nature 

The German poetess [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_von_Droste-H%C3%BClshoff][Annette Freiin von Droste zu Hülshoff]] (1797 -
1848)[fn:158] in her /Der Knabe im Moor/ (/The boy on the moor/ first
appearing in 1842)[fn:159] likewise speaks of Nature's darkening
power; however, Droste means to bring to us the /fear/ of nature as a
superstitious peasant lad would experience it. Here is my free prose
translation of the first stanza

#+begin_verse
How ominous it is to cross the moor, when its haze, its mists writhing like phantoms bind and weave through the low growth; and up comes a springlet beneath every step, a hissing sung from the ground. How eerie it is to cross the moor when the reeds rustle in the breezes...
#+end_verse

...so ominously forsaken, so frighteningly forsaken. But whence this
ominous, frightening, and forsaken? Whence this vulnerability? Whence
the backdrop of superstitions? Droste is narrating a simple, commoner
lad's frightful trip at twilight across a semi-wild section of his
early-nineteenth century Westphalian lowlands, describing in
horrifying detail how the landscape would seem to come alive with
terrible pagan demonic threats. In the next five verses the boy
succumbs in his growing panic to fantasies of evil spirits and actors,
but in the end makes it back---with perhaps some help from his
guardian angel---to Christian civilization. I bring up /Der Knabe/
here because both Brontë and Droste are working with Nature as a
/liminal phase/ which eclipses a known, mundane, daylit locality,
becoming either a spell-binding gate to a higher realm or a downright
frightening reintroduction to the mythological world of a pagan past.

In both cases the landscape is not some far-removed trackless
wilderness only approachable by Victorian explorers, rather, more just
accidentally marginal spaces due to poor growing conditions. To be
sure, these are not pre-historic times when the extensive,
non-fragmented forests were wild and savage and brimming with
animistic spirits routinely interacting with pagan
aboriginals. Centuries of perfunctory Christian indoctrination, along
with bits and pieces of rational science and technology have come
between the human and the surrounding but shrunken wild places.

But then neither Brontë out in the storm nor Droste's boy knows of our
extreme pullback into today's normative anthropocentrism where Nature
is so completely managed and supervised and ultimately
demystified. Their eerie, out-of-time-and-space liminal phase simply
cannot carry the same ominous portent for our logical, desensitised
modern minds.

Let's take an aside to talk about the very important concept of
/liminal space/. Here's a quote found on Reddit from the member
"Killcode2" explaining what a liminal space is

#+begin_quote
Imagine a classroom from your childhood. Surely, you are imagining it
in the day, with sunlight spilling in through the windows and kids
shuffling to their desks. This is the state in which a classroom is
most frequently seen and serves a purpose for. Now imagine sneaking
into your school late at night and everything is empty. It is almost
eerie seeing the same classroom at night, in a totally different
context. Suddenly its usual purpose has been robbed and it is just a
room---but not quite. Because now it also feels strangely alien and
enigmatic to you, a purposeless, otherworldly architecture. The next
day that room would be back to normal, in its default state. It is
back to being a real classroom. But that middle phase it was in when
you saw it in the night, it's a *liminal phase*, a state of
transition. And often spaces like that carry eerie characteristics,
such as being out of time and out of place. That's liminal spaces for
you. The same could apply for an abandoned mall, an overgrown
treehouse, or a swimming pool with all the water gone.
#+end_quote

We can imagine Droste's boy growing up to be a simple, devout
Westphalian Roman Catholic Christian who lived out the rest of his
life with a lurking fear and dread of that one liminal phase encounter
of his otherwise simple and familiar moorland. No doubt he instilled
this fear in his children and grandchildren---just as his head had
been filled by the adults around him with legends and stories passed
down for generations...

Droste offers us this Catholic commoner take on wilds, i.e., a basic
civilization-bound human reaction to nature. The Church, having
quashed pagan spirituality by conflating it with Satan, the root of
all evil, ensured that what was wild and far enough removed from the
church and its Eucharist in the altar tabernacle would be associated
with evil and threat. The word /heathen/ (German /heidnisch/) is
derived from /heath/ (/Heide/)---and there we have a direct link
between wilds and pagan hence evil. And so to venture out on the heath
was to venture into (formerly?) heathen-dominated spaces. Again, a
peasant of Droste's era had no such Earth astronaut mindset as we do
today. To him the great spirit world of his distant pagan ancestors
was just barely held in check by Jesus and the saints. /Where is the
devil?/ Everywhere---/especially/ out on the heath after dark!

Droste underlines a great limitation of our understanding of nature,
of life itself, namely, the vast majority of us are, and probably
always will be, grossly susceptible to irrationality. Being an
aristocrat, she understood that to lead the commoners, to hold the
reins, the aristocrat must understand their functional limitations,
and subsequently /cannot ask them to do what they cannot do, nor go
where they cannot go/. For all intents and purposes, the moorlands are
full of evil after dark, full stop. No attempt at disabusing the
commoner of superstitions is really possible. Droste's is a stasis
attitude, one the Powers That Be cannot, should not attempt to improve
upon.[fn:160]

We may contrast this with Emily Brontë's more refined, educated, and
definitely Protestant-influenced understanding of her heath. Hers was
not the immemorial Catholic peasant mentality, rather, that of an
informed Protestant cleared of the eisegesis,[fn:161] post-scripture
metaphysics supposedly dominating Catholicism. To give an indication
of how different Catholics and Protestants are on metaphysical
phenomena, consider how thousands of saints are officially recognised
by the Catholic church---most having qualified as saintly due to some
metaphysical, paranormal religious experience.[fn:162] Saintless
Protestants, on the other hand, would seem to exclude anything
paranormal miraculous not mentioned directly in the Old or New
Testament of the Bible. Here's Günter Grass from his novel /The
Flounder/ speaking of a priestess of prehistoric pagan times in his
homeland Vistula river delta on the Baltic Sea

#+begin_quote
Because she was a cook, Mestwina was also a priestess. She raised the
cult of Awa to perfection. And when it came time for us all to be
baptized, she brewed up paganism and Christianity into a Catholic
mixture.
#+end_quote

To be sure, a Brontë sister at the dawn of Queen Victoria's reign
drank a much more filtered and distilled mixture. The night Emily
describes is certainly putting on a stormy show, but she is not facing
pagan spirits that had never really quit the Westphalian land as does
Droste's boy. For both, Nature surely takes command, but one witness
wants out and the other wants in.[fn:163] Again, what greater
connection can a human have with Nature than to be so completely and
deeply transfixed that, for some moments at least, one cannot go,
cannot go? This is not reposing in mosses to behold as did Wordsworth;
indeed, this is Nature taking over. With /The night is darkening round
me/ Emily Brontë has faced down the fear, the threat, and has become
some new citizen of Nature. /Hers is a post-pagan Nature worship/. And
as I must emphasise, /this Nature is Dark/, indeed, Dark as a
portentous liminal space experience. While Droste closes mystery
vis-à-vis nature. Brontë flings it open, and out at us rushes Dark
like never before---or since. Liminal space Nature: Tolkien takes us
to his nighttime Lothlorien elves, H.P. Lovecraft's to cosmic demons,
but Brontë to Dark.

I've often wondered why I cannot get on board with more modern
poetry. Why do I now insist only on my few German and English Romantic
Era principals? And then why do I not spend much time on Wordsworth?
Well, I do love the English take on Romanticism, but besides Poe and
Dickinson, I have no attachment to American Romanticism, or
/Transcendentalism/[fn:164]. Why? Let's look at some quotes from Henry
David Thoreau

Very well indeed, but Thoreau is not resigning himself as Emily does
as she stands frozen to her stormy moorland spot. He is advocating for
auspicious choices, commendable posturing, an enlightened attitude,
but he is not under a tyrant's spell, he is not at a sepulchre by the
sea by night. Likewise, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson][Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s greatly lauded /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature_(essay)][Nature]]/
(and primary influence for Thoreau's Walden Pond hermitage) where he
waxes philosophical about nature. In the book-length essay he says
things like

#+begin_quote
Therefore, that spirit, that is, the Supreme Being, does not build up
nature around us, but puts it forth through us.
#+end_quote

or

#+begin_quote
The aspect of nature is devout. Like the figure of Jesus, she stands
with bended head, and hands folded upon the breast. The happiest man
is he who learns from nature the lesson of worship.
#+end_quote

This is all very nice, but then came the two projects inspired
thereof, namely, Thoreau and [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stearns_Wheeler][Charles Stearns Wheeler]] who both tried
their nineteenth-century version of "off the grid," resulting in
(pardon my blasphemy) soap-bubbly impressionisms of Thoreau's
/Walden/. Again, with this American nature swooning I'm just not
seeing, hearing a hard-pressed starving little bat like my Haworth
Emily poetising about Dark. Droste and the Brontë sisters express an
intensity, something of the desperation of life oozes out of their
Nature. But Emerson does show poetising in such lines as these

#+begin_quote
From the earth, as a shore, I look out into that silent sea. I seem to
partake its rapid transformations: the active enchantment reaches my
dust, and I dilate and conspire with the morning wind.
#+end_quote

Yes, I can begin to relate, simply due to the power of /Poesie/ over
polemic and prose. But the brain and the heart must be in balance,
i.e., the brain cannot exceed the heart. Which quickly happens with
the whole Transcendentalism thing---just like Coleridge and the Jena
Set's intellectualizations.

Let me quickly mention Robert Frost's /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/42891/stopping-by-woods-on-a-snowy-evening][Stopping by Woods on a Snowy
Evening]]/ by famous Robert Frost. This would be my Exhibit A of nature
vague and impressionistic, thus, inconsequential. Yes, /the woods are
lovely, dark and deep/ and the place and mood are similar to Keller's
/Winternacht/, but Frost's poetising nature seems to go nowhere except
some dutiful resignation about promises to keep and fatalistic musing
about how many miles he must go before being allowed to sleep. He
presents nature up in a classic liminal phase nighttime mystical
magnum mysterium ambience, /but then he doesn't go anywhere worth
going/ as does Keller, Droste, and Brontë! Aaagh!

*** I'll come when thou art saddest...

Christianity has held the ember of spirituality since Euro-pagan
times, but has never seemed to know what to do with it. As I say,
Protestantism seem to cut the metaphysical down even closer to the
bone. Piety, reverence, holiness---all just a holding pattern while in
extra-nature human civilization. But then Nature and Dark become
participatory again when the Night darkened round Emily.

This is from a letter Emily Dickinson, age twenty-nine, wrote to her
cousin Louise Norcross in January, 1859

#+begin_quote
...and you and I might tug for a life, and never accomplish it, but no
one can stop our looking on, and you know some cannot sing, but the
orchard is full of birds, and we all can listen...
#+end_quote

Does God smile upon our tugging at life? Perhaps Amherst Emily is
merely saying there are more ways to participate in life. But Haworth
Emily is speaking of a very fatalist Calvinist attitude that only when
we are suffering can we know we are not fools. Only when we are
saddest, alone, joyless, in the dark, at the end does God come for
consultation. Only then do the strange sensations roll as precursors
to God's "sterner" power. For how else may our better deal with our
foolishness other than with sternness?

And so we see a Brontëan doom graduated from common gothic
gloom-and-doom melodrama. God is not drama of any sort, but the
keenest of reality we can know. And yet we must perceive it before any
sign of redemption and forgiveness as the most complete and utter
doom.

I say this is Calvinism, fateful and doomy, because there is no Jesus,
no


*** I would have touched the heavenly key...

...or, I would have put more faith, more stock in Jesus, or in
salvation while living, or in the balm and salve of the tantalising
promises of Heaven. But she could not mouth the supposed "good news"
of Christ. Bliss might be fleetingly known while on Earth, but woe and
doom must be endured to the bitter end, as a expurgate of pride,
foolishness, and sinfulness. And then not Heaven but Earth is her
Heaven---as God has so constructed our earthly "starter"
experience. If you want to make God laugh, tell Him your plans, or
/der Mensch denkt, der Gott lenkt/.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Heber][Reginald Heber]]'s /Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!/[fn:165] would only
have been mouthed by Haworth Emily, as she seemingly eschewed any
indulgence of earthy hope,

#+begin_verse
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!

casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
cherubim and seraphim, falling down before Thee,
which wert and art and evermore shalt be.

Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee,
though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;
only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee,
perfect in pow'r, in love, and purity.

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth and sky and sea;

** Grand Marais, my sepulchre by the sea?

One of my earliest encounters with the magic of Dostoevski's /presence
of eternal harmony/ came on a dark Halloween evening back when I was a
little boy of six years in my small Southern Illinois town. We were
trick-or-treating on my street, the oldest in town with its
cobblestone, gas streetlights, and Victorians, and at some point I
knew I had entered another place, another time. Being so young meant I
was not completely disabused of magic; thus, other worlds, other
dimensions did not seem out of the ordinary. I remember looking up
into the dense, bare branches of the giant trees to see the moon
looking out of crossing clouds and feeling like I was a part of some
magical legendspace.[fn:166] Throughout my life I've compared
subsequent POEH experiences with that Halloween night. Perhaps this is
why I cleave to the Dark Muse.

Scoffers will scoff, and no doubt what I just shared can be easily
dismissed as the imaginings of an impressionable small child; but as
someone says in one of my stories, "Magic, it's just in your
head---until it's not anymore." Really, I've tried being the atheist
rationalist science type. In a previous life I was swapping physics,
math, and computer hats, and although it paid the bills, that scene
just never quite worked for me. Science people can be the nicest
people, but they just weren't really my people. Now I'm back to
believing things I did when I was six, and still seeking my people.

I now live in the far northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called
North Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, just
before the Canadian border. This is the very tip of the so-called
"[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region][Arrowhead Region]]" north and east of Duluth, some six million-plus
acres of wilderness on the shores of the world's largest body of
freshwater (by surface area). To my mind, this can be a very Dark Muse
kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, cannot go---as much as my
fellow humans here distress me with their pointedly anti-Dark
attitudes. Pictures may be worth thousands of words, but our Dark vibe
up here must be experienced to be truly appreciated. I routinely get
tiny glimpses of the shadow and magic realm whenever I look out at my
moonlit /Inland Sea/ over the treetops of dark spruce and gnarled,
bare aspen. Once again, Nature is the foundation of Dark.

The /Inland Sea/[fn:167] or /Mother Superior/, as some call her, is so
much more sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is much
smaller and much---plainer, simpler. The enormity of our Inland Sea
means she is often violent like any sea or ocean of saltwater. No
friendly little puddle for beer-and-brats picnickers, speedboat and
jet ski riffraff is she.[fn:168] To be sure, one senses a mighty
présence on her shores, often dark and moody, if not angry and
malevolent on a stormy night. The lady has /personality/.

Despite our huge and all but contiguous wildness, despite our famous
chains of Ice Age glacier lakes in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_Waters_Canoe_Area_Wilderness][Boundary Waters Canoe Area
Wilderness]], the Arrowhead is not /spectacular/ in the stereotypical
"American Great Outdoors" sense. Nothing here overwhelms as with the
American West and Alaska with their "natural wonders" postcard vistas
galore. As I'm saying, a deep moodiness often prevails, setting up the
Dark Muse subtle to sublime pathway. Sadly, however, my local
community is bereft of Dark Musers. Which might have a silver lining
in that I have a perfect laboratory to test whether the Dark Muse is
nature or nurture. That is to say, if I see no past-centuries
architecture,[fn:169] if I have no like-minded community to mutually
re-enforce nighttime proclivities, then any Dark musing must come from
the actual place itself, hence, nature over nurture.

But I am quite alone here with my Dark musings. Despite Grand Marais
counting only some thirteen hundred souls, we are becoming evermore
urban/suburban-like in behavior and mentality. Why? Mainly due to our
popularity as a Northern Midwest resort town. Tourists of short-,
medium-, and long-stay duration, well-off retirees, and especially
relocating urban-suburban refugees constantly mix and dilute the
scene. And these newcomers are increasingly not adapting to small-town
life; instead, maintaining their aloof, disengaged, emotionally
unavailable, blinkered urban-suburban ways. Of course "boosters," the
knee-jerk positive promoters and spin doctors, will always disagree
with this assessment, but many "old-timers" agree that it ain't what
it used to be. Alas.

A particular North Shore social-psychology phenomenon is the large
numbers of people who relocate here from the Midwestern urban
city-states, e.g., Chicago or especially the Twin Cities, ostensibly
to /reinvent/ themselves. Of course tourist destinations traffic in
image and fantasy, but here is a very unique sort of expectancy
build-up. My theory has it that our newcomers have made the leap out
of their sterile, soulless clone-bunny urban/suburban lives intent on
becoming some better, more /authentic/ version of themselves in the
wilderness. The most dominant North Shore reinvention /lifestyle/ is
loosely based around Hemingway and Jack London, i.e., a macho, gonzo,
adventurer take on the Great Outdoors, something I call
/Neo-Klondikism/. Of course the real white European North Shore
pioneers of the late nineteenth, early twentieth centuries were mainly
of Scandinavian origins and brought their admixture of Scandi and
Victorian civilization to the wilderness. But little if any of that
remains, except at the Historical Society's museum. Today we see
/Outside/ magazine acteurs, college-grad back-to-the-lander nouveau
hillbilly peasant chic, with their tattoos, huge beards, Carhartt and
Pendelton duds, Jeep Cherokees, their theme music a faux
country-western Appalachian---in other words, an impromptu guerrilla
theatre of American Zeitgeist stagings. But then what are we supposed
to be doing up here?

Dare I say outright nobody "gets" this place, that I do and they
don't? Yet a tacit understanding exists that here is not dazzling
striking amazing. Here is a lower-key for sure. Lots of wealthy people
are here, but this is certainly not the ostentatious, celebrity scene
like Jackson Hole, Wyoming, or dynastic "old money" like Newport,
Rhode Island. No, we're not in that league.[fn:170] A memorable
advertisement poster for Arrowhead tourism showed a twilit Boundary
Waters wilderness lake with the tagline "Stirred not shaken."[fn:171]
I'm sure many do have Dark Muse moments, but simply lack the cultural
background to process (embellish?) and connect them up as I do. For
example our so-called Northern Lights give pause, are beloved by all,
thus, Night gets a probational capitalisation

Here's a few lines I once wrote some twenty years ago after a
late-autumn hike

#+begin_quote
Mists race westward through the surrounding spruce forest, enveloping
the entire ridge. The light is quickly failing, the Western
Hemisphere’s greatest inland sea just four miles south and seven
hundred feet below fully obscured. Sleet begins to fall stinging my
face, keeping my eyes from fully focusing. Though I hear the wind
through the coated trees, the distant sound of the invisible waves
crashing angrily against the rocks, land's staunch defenders.

I have come the four miles up from the town, up the wet, slippery
trail, up through the darkening forest, to pay homage to this late
autumn wonderland. I, modern human, wear a Gore-tex jacket over a
Merino wool top over a silk base layer. I wear running tights and
padded biking gloves. I wear special minimalist running shoes to
simulate barefoot running. So dressed I am out to face the age-old
elements.

Not a soul as I climb the trail. I pause at the ridge’s two main
streams to take in their loud and clear coursing from all the new
precipitation. I should walk rather than run. But visibility is going
fast and I must reach the ridge top ere dusk.

Fittingly anti-climatic is my arrival at the cloud-bound ridge
top. All but evening's darkness when I set off again for home. The
snow is now accumulating in earnest, making downhill footing
difficult. But the Muse is strong, and the growing twilight and
pooling blackness make it all the stronger.
#+end_quote

That was written before I really had latched onto the Dark Muse. Now
things are much more firmly formed and I'm following a more
intentional path vis-à-vis Dark...

*** My Dark influences

How did I come by Dark? Everyone of my generation knows the television
shows /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family][The Addams Family]]/ and /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Munsters][The Munsters]]/ ... as well as all the
gothic horror films. Odd as those shows were, we all seemed to "get"
the premise and laugh along with the basic goths-versus-normies
gag. Likewise, the biggest film of my childhood, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz][The Wizard of Oz]]/
had many dark themes, especially the Wicked Witch of the West and her
very creepy flying monkeys and castle.[fn:172]

My teen years were influenced mainly by progressive Woodstock Era
memes," the only Dark exposure coming from my paternal grandmother,
who channelled a very Victorian Englishness, inherited as we
understood from her model Victorian mother. She exuded a proto-Downton
Abbey aura, something none of us in that small Southern Illinois small
town could fathom---until we finally saw Maggie Smith's Violet
Crawley, The Dowager Countess of Grantham!

<span class="cap">My grandmother in a more suitable universe.</span>
#+end_export

My Grandma Grace Virginia did not possess great intellect or culture,
and yet she was a potent carrier of the Victorian
mega-meme. Specifically, she exposed us all to its poets, especially
Poe. She could recite /Annabel Lee/ by heart. I say she was not an
educated thinker; nevertheless, she possessed an instinctual grasp of
the Dark Muse as though it was a common thread of hers and the earlier
Victorian generations. Longfellow, the Brownings, and Whittier were
also favourites, and I can only assume she had been infected by her
mother who was born circa 1870. To be sure, we are woven from strands
reaching back into the past.

I joined the U.S. Army right out of high school in 1974, and in 1975,
at the age of nineteen, after basic training and AIT (Advanced
Individual Training), I received my permanent station orders to West
Germany. My first assignment location was far out on the Bohemian
frontier, deep in the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Forest][Bavarian Forest]]/ where the Army and Air Force
operated a small mountaintop electronic eavesdropping post near the
tiny village of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimbach,_Upper_Palatinate][Rimbach]].[fn:173] We were less than one hundred
Americans "on the economy," which meant we had no base nor barracks
and lived out amongst the locals. My rooms were with a farmer family
in a house just below a /haunted/ castle ruins overlooking the wild,
forested main /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoher_Bogen][Hoher Bogen]]/ ridge.

For the first time in my life I was living in, not just hearing or
reading about the Old World. I'll never forget waking up that first
September morning in Rimbach in the small country-style /Pension/ the
Army had rented for transient barracks and social events. It was
located in the centre of the village and overlooked the inner
courtyard of a farm where I saw a wizened old crone out of a fairytale
splitting firewood. I then looked up to the facing hillside and saw a
small troop of men wearing what looked like other-century traditional
costumes hand-scything hay and piling it into a horse-drawn wagon.

For the first time in my life I was not plugged into the all-consuming
social-psychology feed of America and its domineering
media. Everything around me felt old, very old, the local Bavarians
connected to something else, perhaps a fairytale that was now in
suspended animation.[fn:174] And when I was handed a copy of /Lord of
the Rings/ and I first learned of Hobbits and the Shire, yes, this was
the Shire. As the fall turned into winter I spent every free moment
hiking the forested ridge trails. It was as if time had changed
mechanisms from round, perfect cogs to virtual Möbius strips. I would
work a shift at the high-tech American site built on the /Hoher
Bogen/'s most eastern peak, /Eckstein/, then reenter the land time had
forgotten. Nature had a very dark, old, and serious feel in those
environs, while by comparison my Tennessee Smoky Mountains had a
lighter, even merry feel. I almost made it a daily pilgrimage to the
ruins, parts of which had been reconstructed, including the original
keep.[fn:175] A legend said a princess had thrown herself from the
original keep to her death, and her ghost supposedly roamed the place
after dark. Hence, the warning to never be in the woods after dark was
taken seriously.

I can remember the odd dark, gothic moments during my Army time in
Germany. Back then, however, I was not keying on Dark, life simply
experiential. Like a subsequent posting to the north in the small
Lower Saxony town of Schöningen on the East German border. There my
digs were in a centuries-old half-timbered house, likewise, we were on
our own.

There was an interesting incident
which began as I tell people back when I was a soldier in Germany
(1975 - 1978) and visited Amsterdam for Christmas 19


*** Legendsapce receptor sites.




Experiential. Are we to pursue one sort of experiences over others?



*** My Christianity

A few things have led me back to belief in God. Besides the Brontës
and the other poets of the Glorious Nineteenth showing me how wondrous
belief can be when its subtleties are brought out through poetising, I
have a more mundane, topical reason, namely, hallucinogenic drugs. I
mean to say I finally realised that any "mind-altering" chemicals are
a false commandeering of my natural sense of amazement and wonderment,
that a human's innate sense of awe and wonderment must be carefully
maintained and protected, that this highly sought-after presence of
eternal harmony state can never be summoned artificially. I also
realised that simply chasing after POEH moments in general is a bad
practice. Which is why I reject Eastern religions---as I spoke of
above. Again, Buddhism, whether legend-influenced Tibetan or
legend-free Zen, wants us in a permanent POEH, which to my thinking is
an artificial, again, /trans/-humanist state. I repeat, my Haworth
Emily as a lean, hungry, deprived, hard-pressed little bat is my
truth. She who brought nature paganism and the Dark Muse and
anti-woo-woo Protestantism close enough together to smell each other
per Keats' /Negative Capability/.

Christianity as a holding pattern on earth, an intentional backing
away from any sustained POEH state indeed. And I must admit Nature has
time and again told me not to bring any sort of fantasy or stoner
mentality to Her, i.e., expectations (read demands) of heightened,
magical, "cosmic" happenings all for traipsing along a wilderness
trail for a few hours. She has seriously reprimanded me for expecting
some cheap, cliche nonsense like that.

I might call my Christianity a "responsive" Christianity in that I
read, e.g., Christina Rossetti's /Love is strong as death/

#+begin_verse
I have not sought Thee, I have not found Thee,
I have not thirsted for Thee:
And now cold billows of death surround me,
Buffeting billows of death astound me, ---
Wilt Thou look upon, wilt Thou see
Thy perishing me?"

"Yea, I have sought thee, yea, I have found thee,
Yea, I have thirsted for thee,
Yea, long ago with love's bands I bound thee:
Now the Everlasting Arms surround thee, ---
Through death's darkness I look and see
And clasp thee to Me."
#+end_verse

and I feel, I respond. I find Rossetti on the same fatalist wavelength
as Emily Brontë. She is describing an interaction with God not
dissimilar to Haworth Emily's /"I'll come when thou art saddest/
where, again, life is bitterly entropic, i.e., effort is nowhere near
linearly rewarded, plans hardly realised.[fn:176] 

But then organised Christianity is dogma---with results, rewards for
our compliance and obedience thin on the ground other than avoidance
of instant damnation upon death.


** In closing, What is Nature today?

/This section was written at the end of the Summer of 2024./

Earlier this summer the [[https://northhouse.org/][North House Folk School]], a sort of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement][Arts and
Crafts Movement]] holdover, hosted their [[https://www.northhouse.org/events/wooden-boat-show?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhb60BhClARIsABGGtw85B1_ja5XEfwK8z67xLIluZlvh8rzvshmO0ke1XdO84iJQRGChyCsaAqqfEALw_wcB][Wooden Boat Show]] where
non-powered, legacy wooden boats---many built on-site---were on
display, subsequently to be sailed and oared about our Grand Marais
harbour. Indeed, many of these designs were based on the craft used by
the ancestral Norwegian immigrant fishermen of the late nineteenth,
early-twentieth century along our Lake Superior coast. But then all
the happy boating was buzzed by a hooligan on a "personal watercraft"
aka jet ski, throwing wake after wake at the participants. I've
thought about this quite a bit, about how these visiting "educated
elites" from the Twin Cities were mocked by the yokel descendent of
Scandinavian peasant loggers and fishermen. And so we see one
derivative /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality][hyperreality]]/ attacking another. As the Wikipedia article
states

#+begin_quote
*Hyperreality* is a concept that refers to the process of the
evolution of notions of reality, leading to a cultural state of
confusion between signs and symbols invented to stand in for reality,
and direct perceptions of consensus reality ... Hyperreality tricks
consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement,
instead opting for artificial simulation, and endless reproductions of
fundamentally empty appearance... Fulfillment or happiness is found
through simulation and imitation of a transient simulacrum (an
insubstantial, unsatisfactory imitation) of reality, rather than any
interaction with any "real" reality.
#+end_quote

And so what were the idealist, progressive college-gradders hoping to
experience with their proximity to traditional, human-powered boats;
and what was the hooligan from his world of NASCAR, "contemporary"
country music, and Bud Light beer hoping to correct? Are we all just
lost in this endless labyrinth of recursive symbols and derivative
hyperreality?  This is the North Shore theatre I experience
daily... Here's the Fairy Queen's admonition from my poem /Sallow
Sponsor/

#+begin_verse
Lands once Faerie, spoilt by mortal race.
Places once fey now gone without a trace.

Renders pallid planet’s blue-green luminosity,

#+end_verse

Some vague, tacit recognition of our planet-destructive ways, but then
the guilt ameliorated by supporting our sand castle folk school and
its past-era human-powered boating show?

It is now late summer, the Labor Day weekend, and yesterday I hiked
some twelve miles along the densely-forested, geologically-ancient
ridge facing the Inland Sea. The day was sunny and the breezes
cool. Starting at the deep Cascade River gorge some ten miles west of
town on Highway 61 where the river empties into the lake, I headed
inland and west up towards the first notable point, Lookout
Mountain. As I hiked along I encountered dozens of tourists, most of
which considered the remote wilderness trail just another downtown
Minneapolis street, that is to say, they refused eye contact or any
acknowledgement of my existence. At the Lookout Mountain overlook with
its spectacular vista northward across the expansive boreal
wilderness, many of the visitors stood around staring at their
phones.[fn:177] Continuing further west along the high ridge, I saw no
other human. And so I hiked on and on, escorted by various races of
dragonflies through all their strange and varied woodland
neighbourhoods which have grown back since the "tree holocaust" of the
late-nineteenth, early-twentieth centuries when the North Woods were
"logged off," or, in plain English, destroyed. Once I reached the
beautiful Spruce Creek (the original of which I want to visit in
Heaven), I headed back as the nearing-equinox sun was setting.

I sometimes lapse into an elven fairy buzz out in these expansive but
injured and recovering forests. Often enough it only takes one of our
ancient, untouched "old-growth" white cedar groves[fn:178] to send me
to the analogue elven [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien][Lothlórien]] of J.R.R. Tolkien's

Dream as I may, I know these woods do not suffer my imaginative
comparisons, my hyperreal cosplay. So often my mythic daydreams
crumble when I remember that I'm just a visitor, a transient, an
impostor, an alien of the modern era. When I consider all the critters
that call these forests home, each perfectly built for their existence
out in nature, I must wonder who am I, what was I built for? /Often
enough I feel like I wasn't expected, wasn't acknowledged, and then
wasn't missed when I left./ I know that, short of becoming an
aboriginal, I have no way of truly being a part of this wild
expanse. Experience the wild, but once over go home to wonder what it
all meant...

The common setting, backdrop in so many of our European-based
folktales is, of course, nature, mainly in its very intense,
concentrated form of the high-latitude temperate European forest. But
what is it about the outdoors and especially big areas of trees close
together that inspires folk legends and fairy tales?[fn:181] A simple
answer is wild wooded nature was more at hand long ago. It was your
front yard and your back yard, along with the accompanying animist
pagan legendry. And now absence makes the heart grow fonder?

German philosopher Ludwig Klages once said the Germanic people are a
"forest people" with a natural affinity to woodsy places. Does that
mean the older cultures of the Mediterranean, the Middle East, and
Asian East are "garden people" due to their longer years in
post-nomadic civilization?[fn:182] Up until the Roman incursions, we of
Northern Europe had a closer connection to forests, and something
remains deep inside us craving reconnection with and spiritual
expression of wild lands to this day. As I say in my /Emily of
Wolkeld/ novel

Anthropology tells us the biblical /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_of_Eden#Blissful_garden_concept][Garden of Eden]]/ was a myth common
throughout the pre-Judeo pagan Middle East. From the text, Adam and
Eve sounded like the ultimate [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-primitivism][eco-primitivists]], i.e., /really/ living
off the land as God's pet [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruitarianism][frutarians]], so innocent and naive. Then came
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man][The Fall]]/ when we rejected God's sponsorship and struck out on our
own. The Book of Genesis then describes the clash of "systems" through
the two sons of Adam and Eve

#+begin_verse
And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
---Genesis 4:2
#+end_verse

Son Abel represents the nomadic shepherd life drifting along with
flocks of a ruminant species (e.g. sheep) as a symbiotic
quasi-predator; but Cain is the beginning of agriculture where humans
permanently dominate the land for cultivating selective crop species,
thus enabling permanent settlements. This, as the story tells,
displeases God, who rejects Cain's sacrificial offerings while
accepting Abel's slaughtered lamb. God says

#+begin_verse
When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.

...despite the whole idea of being stationary in one spot and
dominating that space with evermore high-yield methods of monocultural
agriculture. And to this day, the Eastern Hemisphere nostalgically

farmer's[fn:183] as we typically do in the New World.

Then come the stories of the Tower of Babel, the destruction of Sodom
and Gomorrah, both of which seem to indicate God was not keen on the
idea of a technologically maturing human race. Especially in the story
of Lot and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, we are confronted
with the question of /what would have happened had Lot obeyed the
angels and gone farther into the hills/? Was God seeking some sort of
reconciliation, and some place higher up in the hills would have been
a sort of halfway house or Eden 2.0?[fn:184] We'll never know, because
Lot and his daughters ducked into [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoara][Zoara]] instead...


During Roman times German Central Europe was largely one extensive,
trackless wilderness area called the /Hercynia Silva/ by Caesar, or
/Hercynian Forest/. This was one contiguous woodland of mainly
temperate climate hardwoods stretching from Northwest France, across
Germany, linking up with the wilds of the Carpathian Mountains. And
beginning with Roman accounts, the region got plenty of mythic and
fantastical press. Another forest of perhaps purely mythical existence
was the "enchanted" Brocéliande Forest of Arthurian fame, which might
have been located in France's Brittany.


*** New woods

By far the majority of Euro-folk legends include, take place in
forests than not, and to name even some would be to leave others
out. And yet it is interesting to note how the Romantic and
Post-Romantic nineteenth century seemed to relaunch the slumbering
pagan forest energy with a vengeance. Romanticism's Nature found a
strong outlet in the deep woods of a long-ago Hercynian Forest or
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ancient_woods_in_England][Ancient Woods]]/ of England. Romanticism's lyrical and philosophical
leaders brought new attention to nature. The Brothers Grimm, beginning
with their fairy tale publications in the late eighteen-teens, did not
hesitate to take the children (and adults) of the entire European
diaspora deep into their mash-up of Iron-Age and Medieval German
forest culture. I recall as a small child being thrilled as well as
frightened as Hansel and Gretel made their harrowing way throughout
their forest, first lost, then found by the murderous /Knusperhexe/,
then saved and reunited with their woodcutter father.

What was an Iron Age, pre-Roman Britain or Germany like? What was in
those woodland spaces? Peopled certainly, some lands cleared around
some settlements, but primordial forests making up the vast majority
of the landscape. And when white people were like indigenous
aboriginals, what were we like, what did we do, what did we believe?
Due to the early Christian cultural genocide we have as good as
nothing left of those times. But today we have our imaginings. And

Norwegian novelist [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knut_Hamsun][Knut Hamsun]] (1859 - 1952) in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth_of_the_Soil][Growth of the Soil]]
(Norwegian /Markens Grøde/) is set in the early twentieth century and
describes a pioneering farmer Isak who, like the early American
settlers, carves out a subsistence farm back in the untamed wilds of a
high, remote Norwegian valley. From the Wikipedia article

#+begin_quote
Hamsun tended to stress the relationship between his characters and
the natural environment.
#+end_quote

Despite being called a leader in Neo-Romanticism, Hamsun's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_new_realism][Norwegian
new realism]]/ contains nothing of what my principals of the early
nineteenth were about. And subsequently he is lauded and called  by all-out modern
realist writers such as Henry Miller, Thomas Mann, Ernest Hemingway,
and many others with strong interests in seeing Romanticism dead and
buried. Isak is cutting wood one evening---and he gets the feeling the
devil is sitting on a log watching him. Otherwise, /Growth.../ hasn't
the least trace of anything Nature capitalised.

In his poem /Letter to Byron in the Great Beyond/ he says, /Our earth has
become an asylum for humanity/. But again, the fact that so many later
modernists leaning heavily into nihilism found him their inspiration
is very off-putting for me.

A Scandinavian contemporary of Hamsun's was the Swedish illustrator
John Bauer who is best known for his depictions in the beloved Swedish
annual folklore publication /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Among_Gnomes_and_Trolls][Among Gnomes and Trolls]]/ (/Bland tomtar

*** Tolkien, an improvement on Christianity?

#+begin_quote
St Bede and others, especially Thomas Aquinas, said that the fall of
Adam and Eve brought "four wounds" to human nature. They are
*original sin* (lack of sanctifying grace and original justice),
*concupiscence* (the soul's passions are no longer ordered perfectly to
the soul's intellect), *physical frailty and death*, and *darkened
intellect and ignorance*. These negated or diminished the gifts of God
to Adam and Eve of original justice or sanctifying grace, integrity,
immortality and infused knowledge. \\
---from Wikipedia article on the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_man][Fall of man]]
#+end_quote

Let me state up front that very few perceive Tolkien as I do. The main
problem being they do not, will not understand the degree to which he
was a Neo-Victorian, a monarchist, a Luddite, and a High Tory, i.e.,
the depth and degree to which he rued industrialisation and rejected
the modern world. Tolkien stated his main fiction influence to have
been George MacDonald, a devout Christian and ordained and practicing
Congregationalist minister---who is considered the founding father of
modern fantasy---but then (surprise) wrote confusingly pagan fairy
tales. Likewise, Tolkien, supposedly a devout Roman Catholic, wrote
about subjects so pagan animistic that he certainly would have been
burnt at the stake by his own church back during the
Counter-Reformation days!  Again, we see in Tolkien these
strange bedfellows Christianity and pagan Nature.

Tolkien was a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology][philologist]] concentrated on the general languages and
lore of pre-Roman Northwestern Europe, specifically the Germanic North
and its [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_paganism][Germanic paganism]]. He was a stickler for scholarly accuracy,
but was dealing with many sources composed after the Roman Empire and
Christianity had come to dominate Celtic-Germanic Europe. For example,
Snorri Sturlson, the Icelandic bard living some two hundred years
/after/ the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization_of_Iceland][kristnitaka]]/ or Christianisation of Iceland is
responsible for the most extensive description of old Norse
paganism. Which is a heavily Viking paganism rather than any sort of
pre-Viking Era animistic paganism. Likewise, /Beowulf/ was arguably
written by a Christian monk after the Christianisation of England,
possibly in the ninth century. Similarly, the /Völsunga saga/ is
"after the fact" and heavily influenced by the Viking take on
paganism. All of which is missing like a phantom limb the
animist,[fn:187] nature-based side of paganism. And so an animist
recreation of pre-Roman Northern Europe in the form of fantasy
commenced, one standing opposite the Christian supposition that humans
are the only sentience, that other thing or creature is merely a stage
prop, and we have absolute dominion over the planet. As British
anthropologist Tim Ingold says

#+begin_quote
Hunter-gatherers do not, as a rule, approach their environment as an
external world of nature that has to be "grasped" intellectually
... indeed the separation of mind and nature has no place in their
thought and practice.
#+end_quote

Most unique and powerful is of course J.R.R. Tolkien's tales set in
his fictitious /Middle Earth/, which is understood to be modelled
after Northwest Europe in some pre-Roman era.

This "total Earth egalitarianism" is strongly present in Tolkien's
idea of his fictional Arda or Middle-earth. In my opinion, Tolkien's
most poignant centrepiece are his elves.[fn:188]

His most relevant Elf is his depiction of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien][Lothloiren]] in

These are his vision of a high-sentience species embedded
magi-perfectly in Nature ... somehow graduated from the idea of crude,
primitive, pre-contact aboriginals, however, noble their savage
existences may be.

Elves are demi-angelic beings. Lothlorien is a would-have been,
could-have been had we stayed in Eden---or had Lot followed the angels
into "the hills.""

Throughout my wonderful hike on that perfect day I would so greatly
appreciate the wild natural beauty, but then be acutely aware of my
great separation from nature. If I said /our growing separation from
nature runs parallel to our growing separation from one another/, I
wouldn't be saying much new. I feel we're now in the midst of a great
unmooring, and all can feel a general dysphoria. It was darkening
round me when I finally arrived back at the highway and my car. I had
finished my visitation and was once more leaving Nature to return to
my human prisoner existence. And so I got in my Prius and drove off
eastwards and home, eating my protein bar and wondering as I had so
many times before what it all meant. After the Cut Face Creek bend
came the red pine woods climbing up the slopes, then the "wastes, " as
the last miles along 61 before town are mainly scrubby aspen

[fn:71] There is nothing really otherworldly Dark or Romanticist as I
know it about Jane Austen, sadly. She was seemingly devoid,
non-pursuant of Dostoyevski's POEH. Although she once did say,
"Pictures of perfection, as you know, make me sick and wicked."
(Letter to her niece Fanny Knight, 23 March 1817.)

[fn:73]  YMMV. Personally, I like a good doom-and-gloom session, and
Young really delivers with /Night Thoughts/. Later we'll go into Emily
Brontë's take on doom-and-gloom and her more measured Christian
perspective.

[fn:74] ...that is, in a past age not exposed to the science of modern
public relations. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays][this]] about Edward Bernays and the birth of
modern advertising and public relations. TL;DR: Since Bernays, no
"movement" in our modern times can be considered natural and organic,
rather, the result of somebody's financed public relations campaign.

[fn:75] ...but the Germans were not idle during this time, either. I
should also mention Gottfried August Bürger's very popular and often
translated into English epic poem /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenore_(ballad)][Lenore]]/ from 1774.

[fn:76] /Das Land der Dichter und Denker/. Intentionally absent was
novelists. Although now novelists count as part of /die Belletristik/,
i.e., /schöngeistige Literatur/ or aesthetic literature.

[fn:77] Two terms, /novel/ (English) and /roman/ (French, German,
etc. from the adjectival /Roman/, /Roman-like/) came to describe any
long-form prose story-telling.

[fn:78] Ironically, the /Novella/, a long short-story format with no
chapter breaks, was better tolerated in Germany.

[fn:79] One giveaway is /gothic/ in the title. Perhaps read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction][this

[fn:83] Once asked why his horror films were so popular, Alfred
Hitchcock said the man on the street likes to occasionally dip his toe

[fn:84] My former wife, a Jane Austen fan, read /Wuthering Heights/
and advised me to skip it. I always trusted her literary advice and,
thus, have never read it.

[fn:85] ...although Wordsworth would later mention Barbauld and
/ASEM/ as inspirational.

[fn:86]  The Jena Set's Friedrich Schlegel first used /romantic/ in
contrast to /classic/ to describe what they in Jena were supposedly
starting. But it wasn't until the 1820s when the term Romanticism
became widely known and used---evermore randomly...

[fn:87] A quote from M.H. Abrams' laborious /The Mirror and the Lamp/
would insist ... /even an aesthetic philosophy so abstract and
seemingly academic as that of Kant can be shown to have modified the
work of poets./ Really? I doubt the Brontë sisters read much Kant. But
then Abrams never mentions the Brontës...

[[https://youtu.be/R6mefXs5h9o?si=c-cJk0fKTneunPZH][Eternity]]/ at your peril.

[fn:89] Notably absent is *Romanticism = Dark*...

[fn:90] From the outset, the Schlegels in Jena made Shakespeare a
principal proto-Romanticist, Ludwig Tieck and others of the Jena Set
feverishly translating his plays into German. For me this was a clear
sign they were on the wrong road. I will at some future date have my
fictional character from my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ tell you why.

[fn:91] So convenient for modern experts that Jena Romanticism came
about in a for its time free-wheeling university town, many of the
Jena Set also lecturers and professors at the University of
Jena. Perhaps a modern version would have been [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mountain_College][Black Mountain College]].

[fn:94] Contrast with E.T.A. Hoffmann's very gothic and sinister /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(short_story)][The

automaton.

[fn:103] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_mediatisation][German mediatisation]] brought on by Napoleonic conquest of the

[fn:105] Below I will deal with Virginia Woolf's criticism along those
lines.

[fn:106] Oddly enough, the Brontës are completely left out of many key
academic analyses of Romanticism. For example, Abrams' /The Mirror and
the Lamp/, Beach's /The Concept of Nature in Nineteenth-Century
English Poetry/, and Berlin's /The Roots of Romanticism/ make no
mention of them! Maybe they had read [[https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Bronte-upload-4.pdf][Virginia Woolf's comments on
/Jane Eyre/]] and had given them up for a bad job. See [[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/19/virginia-woolf-in-bronte-country-jane-eyre][this analysis]] as
well. Big cringe. More soon...

[fn:112] Again, the Romantic Era is typically fenced between the years
1800 and 1850.

[fn:113] ...e.g., the Brontës were pastor's daughters in rural West
Yorkshire with little exposure to (taint from?) the cultural and
literary buzz of the cities.

[fn:114] Today we have the concept of left-brain, right-brain, as
often enough nothing else can describe this split-personality
confusion. The best ideas about left/right brain are those of Iain
McGilchrist. Try [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK7XG3t2nFg&list=PLqBHk3itxyPDKFnwj8-SmlwHra64cCrky&pp=iAQB][these]].

[fn:115] [[https://engines.egr.uh.edu/english-romanticism/what-romanticism][This]] will save you some googling. Note especially the
tortured origin of the term /romantic/.

[fn:116] For what it's worth, German Romanticism can be broken down
into Jena, Heidelberg, then Berlin Romanticism based largely on the
principle artists.

[fn:117] Again, Goethe would criticise Romanticism harshly, but
attempted to bridge proto-Romanticm /Sturm und Drang/ with his new
classicism.

feelings and poetisation as my principals saw it, that would be
Sigmund Freud.

[fn:122] *Pathetic* from Middle French /pathetique/ "provoking emotion,"
borrowed from Late Latin /pathēticus/ "affecting the emotions," borrowed
from Greek /pathētikós/ "capable of feeling, emotional, receptive,
passive, i.e., not pathetic as we today use it to mean sad and
contemptible.

[fn:123] /Deus sive Natura/, the slogan of Baruch Spinoza's pantheism:
the view that god and nature are interchangeable, or that there is no
distinction between the creator and the creation.

[fn:124] Perhaps see [[https://youtu.be/6TK9c-caEcw?si=VfMnEZFDX9QXrIPX][Bertrand Russell on his meeting with Vladimir
Lenin in 1920]]. A Fabian, "brochure" leftist meets real leftism...

[fn:125] Sometimes the apologists throw in the towel to complete
absurdism. Consider [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture][Brutalism]] where ugliness is normalised.

[fn:126] Platonic as opposed to romantic-sexual love was seen in the
past as a higher, deeper, quasi-sacred form of love, i.e., the love
going on in heaven between the saints and angels brought down to
Earth. Today, however, we are made to understand by the Freudians that
the human can only ever be a crazed sex monkey, thus, any other view
is delusional puerile. Desensitisation then becomes the only answer to
"sexual hangups."

[fn:127] ...discussed below...

[fn:128] Emily Brontë as a modern, filled-out "cottagecore emo girl"

[fn:129] I contend libertarianism is simply a new form of liberalism,
that is to say, liberalism has gotten so big that leftism no longer can
contain it all.

[fn:130] ...which according to AncestryDNA is in roughly equal

[fn:131] Unlike the single-minded /satori/ goal of Zen Buddhism,
Tibetan Buddhism would seem to float on a legend world of ancient
Tibetan myth, hence, it might be an exception to my general rejection
of Buddhism.

[fn:132] ...and many of those were theology students come to study the
Swiss Protestant movement, i.e., Zwingli and the Anabaptists.

[fn:133] Since then I have estranged many friends when I finally admit
to not wanting any western Eastern. Just this year a former friend
accused me of being fascist when I declined to accept an
all-expenses-paid retreat with her guru, so frustrated she had
become...

[fn:134] Jokingly I claim to have been /verdeutscht/, or "germanised,"
the prefix /ver-/ usually shading negative, e.g., /ver/-dorben
meaning ruined. But then I found out Luther had coined the term back
in the sixteenth century to describe his translation of the Bible from
Latin into German.

[fn:136] See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback][this discussion]] for the general idea of /positive feedback/.

[fn:137] [[https://youtu.be/gUevJ492LSw?si=A4qJKnf4LX_d4zlE][This]] is a tolerable scene in the otherwise typically hideous
/The Favourite/ depiction of Queen Anne.

[fn:138] According to Wikipedia, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory][Cultural Marxism]] is a scurrilous
far-right conspiracy theory. I merely use it as a catch-all for what
indeed would seem to be a broad and thoroughly amoral, nihilist attack
on Western culture and values in the classic agitprop Marxist
sense. Anti-Western sentiment is not some planned political
campaign, rather, a long-in-the-making descent from a Western zenith
such as the British Victorian Era. More as we go along...

[fn:139] "White Eurocentric kitchen? Haven't been there in years..."

[fn:140] Interesting how the whole African-American "roots" thing has
all but died away. And Middle Eastern in the form of Islamic
fundamentalism also has passed its peak and is seeing heavy push-back
in America and Europe.

[fn:141] British writer Anthony Burgess once told of his experience of
the British military turning a blind eye to opium use amongst the
troops stationed in Southeast Asia due to the overwhelming alienation
and dysphoria they suffered there.

[fn:142] A good example would be the critically-acclaimed film
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Wallah][Shakespeare Wallah]]/, which deals with the sudden irrelevance of
English culture in post-British Raj India.

[fn:143] Perhaps watch [[https://youtu.be/cs4CQx5Zk_E?si=hCrszLjHzfaXTn6l][An English Woman Who Becomes a Buddhist Monk!]]
to see what happens when the West and East wrestle for dominance. This
is seen by many in the West as a great story of women's rights. As an
outsider Diane Perry fights against Tibetan Buddhist tradition and
gains concessions for women. But seen from a different angle, this is
simply misguided cultural pollution---best of intentions or not...

[fn:144] Romans 3:23: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.

[fn:145] Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians 13:12.

[fn:146] ...a blessing perhaps?

[fn:147] Let me finally mention here that the word /wuthering/ is
"Northern" dialect for the wind blowing; from late Middle English
/whither/, /wuther/ "rush, make a rushing sound", probably of
Scandinavian origin; or /whithering/ comes from the Old Norse and
means roaring like the wind on a stormy day. This is the sort of
/wuthering/ I'm using in my title /WutheringUK/, i.e., I'm not
referencing the book.

[fn:148] Many believe James Joyce's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulysses_(novel)][Ulysses]]/ with its
stream-of-consciousness and bursty fragments style was a
breakthrough. Unfortunately, I say that even though it presumably
coattails on the Homer classic /The Odyssey/, it really goes nowhere
except into some nihilist absurdist void, offering us nothing other
than a curious writing exercise for hipster literati snob appeal. Some
want it to be exposé realism, but even there Joyce is only
half-hearted at best...

[fn:149] /Gestalt/ in the sense of form, pattern,
configuration. Perhaps as well legends are comprised of /atoms/ of
legend stuff, etc. More on "legend receptor sites" later.

[fn:150] Case in point is Goethe's /The Sorrows of Young Werther/
(first print 1774) which supposedly unleashed a wave of suicides of
young men who identified all too closely with the story's male
protagonist who commits suicide after losing at love.

[fn:151] ...forcefully, poking me in the chest with his finger!

[fn:152] Compare perhaps with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade#Philosophy][Mircea Eliade]] "terror of history"
concept where, literally, the linear progression of time and history
is meaningless when compared to the mythical sacred times of
origin. In effect, mundane life is meaningless, thus, its accumulation
of "events" are also meaningless, albeit oppressive for those still
trapped in their strictly mundane interpretation of life and reality.
