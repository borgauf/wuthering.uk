** /Introduction/

The purpose of this media effort will be to convey some of my thoughts
and impressions about things /dark/, or as I cal it, the /Dark
Muse/[fn:1]. This would hopefully include, be a superset of what is
known today as goth[fn:2] and gothic. And so I hope to go much deeper
and more elemental than most contemporary understandings of dark. Do
you feel spoken to by things a tad gloomy? Do you find dreamy what
they find dreary? Does a cloudy day bring out an strangely sanguine
melancholy? Is a stormy night thrilling? Do you pause to gaze out upon
an old, overgrown cemetery, or an empty, lonely, nondescript
countryside? Does twilight revive your senses? Do you wish every month
(or every week!) had a Halloween?  Do you quickly max-out on
happy-clappy, sunny-cheery? Do you prefer candlelight over artificial
light? If yes to any of this, I'm speaking to you.

Let's start with an example, a litmus test of sorts. It's a poem from
my main darkness benefactress, the poet who stands at the centre of
everything I mean to say about dark---Emily Jane Brontë [fn:3]

#+begin_verse
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse

Rather direct, blunt even. But there it is: You either get it or you
don't. Either she speaks to something in you---or you're immediately
put off and find it, well, weird, overwrought, melodramatic, puerile,
morbid, or even sick or evil. Of course many people consider such a
penchant for dark things morose, morbid, indicative of an unstable,
labile mind, that is to say, something needs curing, fixing. This is
certainly not my take on dark. To be sure, *my take on the Dark Muse
is informed by key poets (the Brontës foremost) from the mainly early
nineteenth century.* They have shown me how dark goes to the core of
life.

Let's try another poem. Here is Longfellow's[fn:4] /Snow-flakes/

#+begin_verse
Out of the bosom of the Air,
      Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,
Over the woodlands brown and bare,
      Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
            Silent, and soft, and slow
            Descends the snow.

Even as our cloudy fancies take
      Suddenly shape in some divine expression,
Even as the troubled heart doth make
      In the white countenance confession,
            The troubled sky reveals
            The grief it feels.

This is the poem of the air,
      Slowly in silent syllables recorded;
This is the secret of despair,
      Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,
            Now whispered and revealed
            To wood and field.
#+end_verse

And so he processes agents of depression[fn:5]---despair, grief,
misery---into more equanimous states of sadness and melancholy by
reaching out into the natural world and /poetising/[fn:6]. This is the
modus operandi of the nineteenth-century poet. It was as if they
understood sadness to be a sort of cancer or virus that may eventually
go into remission, but can never be entirely eliminated while on
Earth. I contend we have lost the ability to process depression into a
stasis melancholy, i.e., to find a modus vivendi[fn:7] with the trials
and tribulations of life. Instead, the modern human is lost in a house
of mirrors, an echo chamber of illusions fuelled by fantastical
unreasonable expectations, thus, unable, unwilling to handle life's
slings and arrows. No, the human can never learn to suffer; we suffer
poorly. But I would say the Romantic Era poets had a better grasp of
life, namely, they faced and accepted doom.

Here is another great example of "you get the Dark Muse or you don't,"
this time from Emily Elizabeth Dickinson's [fn:8] /There's a certain
slant of light/

#+begin_quote
There's a certain Slant of light, \\
Winter Afternoons — \\
That oppresses, like the Heft [fn:9] \\
Of Cathedral Tunes — \\
\\
Heavenly Hurt, it gives us — \\
We can find no scar, \\
But internal difference — \\
Where the Meanings, are — \\
\\
None may teach it – Any — \\
'Tis the seal Despair — \\
An imperial affliction \\
Sent us of the Air — \\
\\
When it comes, the Landscape listens — \\
Shadows – hold their breath — \\
When it goes, 'tis like the Distance \\
On the look of Death — \\
#+end_quote

Indeed. That last line includes /Death/, capitalised[fn:10]. It is my
contention that these nineteenth-century creators understood death
differently than we do today. And since this capitalised,
other-century view of Death has become so opaque, let me attempt an
explanation of how I think they understood it.

** Nature and Death in the nineteenth century

Main points: \\
➝ No "degrees" of nature, rather, nature ubiquitous \\
➝ Nature not a place, rather, nature universal \\
➝ The increasingly extra-natural human

I believe today's understanding of nature is very different than
that of early-nineteenth-century poets such as the Haworth and Amherst
Emilies [fn:11] and their contemporaries. And as a consequence, we
understand life and death much differently.

Just considering our indoor living environments today, a modern
building is more like a sealed spaceship landed on a hostile alien
planet compared to the simpler, more primitive indoor environments of
the not-so-distant past. Literally, the Brontës' Haworth parsonage,
built in 1778 out of local stone and wood and clay, had more in common
with human shelters from thousands of years previous than with a
modern suburban house only some two hundred years later. /In just
these two to three hundred years a very steep gradient has grown
between indoors and outdoors./ And this in turn has brought us to see
nature as a /place/ outside of our artificial, high-tech, controlled
and regulated modern indoor spaces. Which, in turn, leads to us to
rate the outdoors on continua of relative wildness and remoteness from
our sealed-off, self-contained humans-only environments.

No doubt humans have always made a distinction between being inside
and outside of a shelter. Of course we came in and out of the
so-called /elements/. But once we gave up nomadic life to live in
permanent city-states starting some six thousand years ago, we began
spending more and more time in the /Great Indoors/. And these indoor
environments embedded in expansive urban centres have become
increasingly self-contained, self-referencing, recursively derivative,
and, above all, physically removed from the natural world.

In the West, architecture seemed to reach a fantastical aesthetic
crescendo in the Victorian nineteenth century[fn:12], coinciding with
an exponential growth in urban population. Today the steepness of our
indoor-outdoor gradient has increased even more since Western
Victorian times. Today we are more /extra-natural/ than ever.

How can we objectively measure our separation from nature? How can we
count how many rabbit hole bifurcations we've taken down and away from
nature? We may see this dominion over, abstraction away, separation
from nature as our fate, our destiny. And we have adapted to this
separation---our population doubling in less than fifty years to eight
billion is one measure of prevailing. But have not some of us in
recent times become acutely aware of, if not concerned over this
estrangement?[fn:13] I certainly have.

Was it inevitable for us to create a separate physical world of our
own unique design, derivative of derivative of derivative? But what if
we look at nature as less a place inside or outside of our human
spaces, rather, as /everything going on everywhere/? *I say nature was
once seen as the myriad cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on everywhere---with no mind for location.* I contend the
Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, sensed this pre-modern
meaning of nature as sans location inside or outside. Yes, one went
outside, out into the elements. But once back indoors, the human was
not so completely out of and above nature's touch, influence, /doom/
as we now imagine ourselves. Again, the cycles of birth, growth,
deterioration, and death were happening everywhere[fn:14]. Here again
is Emily Brontë, her /The night is darkening round me/

#+begin_verse
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow;
But a tyrant spell has bound me,
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;
The storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below;
But nothing drear can move me;
I will not, cannot go.
#+end_verse

She refers to the wilds as "wastes" and as drear, and yet she is
transfixed, frozen to the spot, and she cannot, cannot go. Subjective
terms like wastes and drear remind of the age-old attitude of nature
as a sponsor of disaster and death, something to get away from, hardly
over which to wax poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that, and to be
sure, sublimely. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared
directly into an enemy previously terrible unforgiving, and in so
doing she found sublimity[fn:15] and brought to us a new way to be
human.

With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around, the last two components, deterioration and
death, must be seen beyond our mechanistic modern take of just
terminal, physical breakage and malfunction[fn:16]. Especially death,
which becomes Death, a quasi-spiritual /force majeure/. But today
deterioration and death seem almost cordoned off, to be sure, under
much more control than ever before---as if through modern medicine we
have begun to acquire demi-godlike veto power over physical demise. Of
course death is an undeniable certainty, and comes as a result of
accident, old age, or as physical aggression or predation[fn:17]. But
a completely different attitude arises when modern healthcare's
labyrinth of diagnoses, drugs, procedures and surgeries routinely
thwart what was once all but unstoppable. It's as if we've overturned
fate and doom.

#+begin_verse
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
--- Psalm 90:10
#+end_verse

This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its absolutist
finalism, its resounding inevitability; life starkly contrasted by
death inescapable. Death is life's backstop against which any ball
thrown bounces back. Death forms the walls of life's sandbox.

Now contrast this with our modern attitude that death may be
postponed, routinely cheated. Psalm 90:10 is making the point that by
no means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty years of life. And yet we
have grown to expect a quality seventy, eighty, ninety, even more
years, as something due us by modern medical science.

Let me relate a modern story to our new attitude towards death. My
father, who has since passed away, lost his /third/ wife to lung
cancer caused inevitably by decades of smoking[fn:18]. But instead of
accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I finally theorised that he
had taken in all the explanations of the various medical interventions
--- including their probabilities of success or failure --- and built
up hope that the death sentence of lung cancer could, /should/ be
beaten by some technology in some corner of the modern medical
labyrinth.

Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed death's arrival to
such an absurd degree. Today, however, the fourscore years spoken of
in Psalms almost seem like a guarantee of modern medicine---even to
the extent that old age and death are increasingly spoken of as
"diseases" medical science can and should defeat. Hence, we feel
cheated, as my father did, when that three-, fourscore and more is not
forthcoming. What is obviously missing is a humility towards death.

** Thriving versus surviving; top dog versus underdog

In his book /The Genius of Instinct/ [fn:19] the author and
psychologist Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to
seek out the best conditions for /thriving/, that any life other than
one of maximised thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the
example of bats, which, according to research, seem to seek out human
buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock outcrops,
hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing this they enjoy advantages
such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant mortality,
less threat of predation. This may be true, but havenn't these bats
jumped /outside/ of the original constraints where they once were completely
integrated with nature? These advantaged bats are now in a state of
/trans/-bat-ism. But is that a good thing?

Perhaps with bats this is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis the
rest of their surrounding environment. However, what happens when a
species continues to expand its "thriving," increasing its success
statistics, evermore stepping over, past any of the natural
restrictions that real integration and harmony with nature would have
required? *Aren't we humans Exhibit A of just such an out-of-control
species?* And so I ask, how can this be good, end well?  How can a
dominant species like ours which is always "gaming the system" not
eventually have to pay some price? Simply put, How can more and more
people consuming more and more resources and energy, wanting,
expecting to thrive, not result in an eventual disaster? It's as if
nature has two games: A) stead-state niche/stasis and B) exponential,
dynamic growth. And whenever a species is not restricting itself to a
niche, exponential growth set in---which will eventually hit its
inflexion point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards
an inevitable crash.

And so I ask, Was Emily Brontë not such a hard-pressed little bat out
in the wilds, she colony-less, huddled in a hollow tree, barely eking out
a marginal life? Here's her /Plead for me/

#+begin_verse
Why I have persevered to shun
The common paths that others run;
And on a strange road journeyed on
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—--
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.

These once indeed seemed Beings divine,
And they perchance heard vows of mine
And saw my offerings on their shrine—--
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,
And mine were worthily despised;

My Darling Pain that wounds and sears
And wrings a blessing out from tears
By deadening me to real cares;
And yet, a king—--though prudence well
Have taught thy subject to rebel.

And am I wrong to worship where
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me
And tell why I have chosen thee!
#+end_verse

This is her ode to skipping the trans-bat scene of her day. I can't
help but believe she was a little bat. In my mind’s eye I can
only see her as driven across the semi-wilderness moorland, all but a
wretch of a human suffering deprivations we see today only in the
third world. Emily Brontë died of anorexia/malnutrition,
contaminated water, tuberculosis --- pick one, two, or all three ---
five months after her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the greater
world outside of tiny Haworth village for a few months, and that
greater world had nothing modern, e.g., a cut on a toe could lead to
an infect requiring amputation or even worse.

But then one might ask if her existence in the early nineteen century
was so very wild and rugged. If we live in our modern indoor world
swimming in unprecedented levels of materialism, i.e., one hundred
times the resources and energy per capita as one of our ancestors from
1800, how close to nature was she?  When we think of how the Romantic
Era poets perceived and reported nature, we think of picnics like from
the film /Emma/ on grassy slopes where dandies and their pampered
ladies are attended by servants

#+end_export

For modern tastes nature is a place outside of our modern interior
spaces --- that is evermore truer nature the farther afield it
lays. And so an absolute trackless wilderness many days travel from
civilization is the truest nature, while the weakest nature would be
the ditch of weeds behind our suburban vinyl-siding-clad house.

** Graveyard School versus Night and Graveside Schools




Life is life only with death. Without death a strange irrelevance
begins to shake at life's foundations.


Today nature is something entirely outdoors, e.g., the /Great
Outdoors/. 


After writing on my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ for the past seven years
I have made a rather bitter discovery, namely, that mankind is largely
wandering about clueless --- /seriously/ clueless.

One key turning point was to finally understand what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats][John Keats]] meant
in his /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability][Negative Capability]]/ letter to his brother. In it he describes
what he means by Negative Capability, the ability to not rush to
philosophical conclusion, rather, to let a sort of cognitive
dissonance run its course. But then Keats also condemns Samuel
Coleridge's obsession with philosophical truth, repudiating his
/Biographia Litararia/, which was Coleridge's attempt to, among other
things, bring the bulk of German Romanticism to a British audience.


** Really feeling

#+begin_verse
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched --- they must be felt with the heart.
--- Helen Keller
#+end_verse


** Why the "North Shore"?

I live in the far-northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called North
Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, along the shore
before the Canadian border. This so-called "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region][Arrowhead Region]]" holds
some three million-plus acres of wilderness on the shores of the
world's largest body (by surface area) of freshwater. And to my mind,
this is a very Dark Muse kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, I
cannot go. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but our dark vibe
here must be experienced to be really appreciated.

Though I'm wont to call Lake Superior the /Inland Sea/, thus, North
Coast instead of North Shore. This is due to /her/ being so much more
sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is something much
smaller and much friendlier. The Inland Sea is big and often violent
like any sea or ocean of saltwater. She's no simple lake for
beer-and-brats picnickers, windsurfers, speedboat and jet ski
riffraff[fn:20]. /She/ has a mighty présence, often dark and moody if
not threatening.

A deep moodiness prevails. Here is nothing really spectacular in the
sense of the Great Outdoors overwhelming with one postcard vista after
another---as we think of the American West and Alaska. Rather, here is
a more subtlety, more reserve, more mood.

Though I feel quite alone here in this assessment. My little
village, Grand Marais, the county seat, is only some thirteen hundred
souls. And yet as the years go by we are becoming evermore
suburban-like in mentality. Being a popular Northern Midwest resort
town, We have a steady stream of newcomers who increasingly are not
adapting to small-town life; instead, maintaining their aloof,
disengaged, blinkered urban-suburban ways. So often one encounters
another supposed fellow human---only to receive the "you don't exist"
treatment common on a street in Manhattan.

Another social-psychology pitfall is how many people came up from a
Chicago or especially Twin Cities suburb ostensibly to reinvent
themselves. They've made the leap out of the sterile, soulless
clone-bunny suburbia to now be some new version of themselves. They
typically use Hemingway and Jack London, i.e., a macho attitude about
wilderness and what. I call this /Neo-Klondikism/.

Steger etc. totally different from the real pioneers of late 19th-,
early 20th-century who brought Victorian civilization to the
wilderness.

Grand Marais is my "sepulchre by the sea."

Quietude and contemplation in a place far from civilization.

[fn:2] The modern "goth subculture" as perhaps described [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture][here]]. It's as good
as any... Lots more about goth and Dark Muse later.

[fn:3] Oddly enough, I've never read her /Wuthering Heights/ and do
not intend to. However, her poetry I read continually, gleaning new
insights each time. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB][here]] for a quick biography.

he lost both of his wives, the first to a miscarriage, the second to a

[fn:6] The idea of poetising, the /poetisation/ of nature and life was
central to the Romantic Movement. It parallels the long-standing

[fn:9] weight, heaviness; importance, influence; (archaic) the greater
part or bulk of something.

[fn:10] Dickinson often employed the German practice of capitalising
nouns for poetic emphasis.

[fn:11] My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson are based on
their towns of origin --- Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.

[fn:12] ...with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as a leading
style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
"revivalist-nostalgic" (Greek, Gothic, Italianate, Elizabethan, Queen
Anne, etc.), perhaps a hearkening back to times more integrated with
nature, with shallower gradients between indoors and outdoors?

[fn:13] Is our slow and gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog][boiling frog]] metaphor?

[fn:14] Obviously the Industrial Revolution created urban production
landscapes vast and barren and completely outside of any sort of
nature, spatial or otherwise. Indeed, William Blake's "satanic mills."
This was a huge step away from the physical world being solely the
purveyance of nature.

[fn:15] More on Edmund Burke's (as well as Bertrand Russell's) false,
"don't get it" tedium on sublimity later. In short, /sublime/ is what
we may find beyond mere beauty, touching what Dostoevsky is saying
here: /There are seconds, they only come five or six at a time, and
you suddenly feel the *presence of eternal harmony*, fully
achieved. It is nothing earthly; not that it is heavenly, but man
cannot endure it in his earthly state. One must change physically or
die. The feeling is clear and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense
the whole of nature and suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not
tenderheartedness, but simply joy./ Again, much more later...

[fn:16] ...as when a car is written off as "totalled."

[fn:17] For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are---outside of war and homicidal criminal activity---all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.

[fn:18] Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.

[fn:20] Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her lasting more
than ten minutes can lead to hypothermia ... at least on the North
Coast. Wisconsin and Michigan beaches can be swimmable in the summer.
