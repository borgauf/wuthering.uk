January through September, 2024

** To begin

(/Note: I began writing this in the Winter of 2024 and it is now the
Michaelmas weekend; and so my external references might shift as we
go.../)

Light snow drifts gently down from the low clouds draped over a misty
boreal forest. Deer in their grey winter coats process along invisible
lines through the fir and spruce. Ravens and crows dolefully croak and
caw back and forth. Such an ambience to convey my thoughts, my
impressions and /feelings/ about my dark proclivities, my /Dark
Muse/.[fn:1]

Do you find it difficult to describe your fascination with things on
the gloomy side? You often find /dreamy/ what others find /dreary/
... as when an overcast day brings on a strangely sanguine melancholy
... or a stormy night is magnificent in a frightening and thrilling
sort of way? Twilight is a welcome reprieve from the hectic, incessant
day, freeing your senses, calming, deepening your thoughts. You've
paused to gaze transfixed upon a lonely, nondescript landscape, a
wild, deserted shore, an old, abandoned cemetery. As when a decaying,
overgrown, other-century structure makes you envious of the bats
living there. Unnatural is having to get out of heat into air
conditioning and suffer through smalltalk while drinking iced
beverages; truer it seems to come inside out of the cold and sit by a
fire in a deep, shared silence drinking hot tea. Time and again what
they find "uplifting" is piteously trite out to ruefully disappointing
for you. Panic and nausea well up when somebody is flogging
sunny-cheery. It is then being alone is a relief, not at all
lonely. They seem to bounce from spectacular to spectacular; while
things subtle, veiled, shadowy tenuous, understated are your
druthers. Their heroes grasp desperately for cheeriness and must have
happy endings. Yours learn and grow by facing the grim and harsh---and
if that means succumbing to the thrashing, amen, requiescat in pace,
RIP, c'est la vie, time for mourning black.[fn:2] And so candlelight
over artificial light, linen over nylon, old architecture over new,
the genial disorder of wild nature over the forced containment of
gardens. If in a city, you can't stand anywhere but the oldest
quarter, oldest park, oldest cemetery. And yes, it might seem a bit to
ask, but wouldn't it be grand if every month we celebrated
Halloween?...  If yes to any or (hopefully) all of this, you might
understand what I'm trying to say here.

*** Natural Dark, Brontëan style

I provide here a quote from Charlotte Brontë's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre][Jane Eyre: An
Autobiography]]/. Main protagonist Jane describes the house of her
adoptive family, the Rivers, called simply /Moor House/, and the
environs on the edge of the wild Yorkshire moors during the reign of
George III[fn:3]

#+begin_quote
They loved their sequestered home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique
structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering
walls, its avenue of aged firs---all grown aslant under the stress of
mountain winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly---and where no
flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom---found a charm both
potent and permanent. They clung to the purple moors behind and around
their dwelling---to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path
leading from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks
first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields
that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a
flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced
lambs---they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of
attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
and sweep---on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by
moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,
and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were
to them---so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast
and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of
sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for
me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them---wound round my
faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.
#+end_quote

... /the consecration of its loneliness/ indeed. I often read this
passage just to muse upon the wistful, moody, delicately melancholic,
intentionally anti-spectacular subtleties she describes---and how this
and other choice moments set the whole tone and mood of the
book. Charlotte Brontë establishes light and dark as equals, then
works expertly with the gradient there between. The dim, the shadows,
the dark, the harsh, even at times merciless inclemencies are features
not bugs. She does not suppress dark, perhaps knowing that if it were
seen an equal to light it would eventually prove itself the older,
wiser sibling, capable of rich, complimentary contributions.

One notable gradient boon is how she has the Moor House environs so
very abandoned, lonely, hence, ultra-wild /exactly/ because they are
so unpresuming and overlooked, so bereft of anything
nature-spectacular ... as opposed to some breathtaking, necessarily
primordial wilderness millions of miles away, visited only by the most
intrepid explorers.[fn:4] Indeed, subtle and unassuming become the
older, wiser siblings of grand and spectacular. Notable too how Jane
arrived at Moor House---on her hands and knees half dead from hunger
and exposure, thus, adding complete and ultimately /necessary/
vulnerability to this sublime mix. It is exactly this vulnerability
that qualifies her as a real part of the scene. And once recovered,
she is still every bit the underdog---relative to us today in our
modern nature-dominating high-tech, hyper-materialist world where we
are nothing but astronauts on our own planet. This point is key to
what I'll say later...

*** Nature staged...

The second half of my childhood was spent in Tennessee,[fn:5] and my
favourite place was the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smoky_Mountains_National_Park][Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]/ high on
the ancient Appalachian Mountains border of Tennessee and North
Carolina. The /Smokies/ are a federally protected, quasi-pristine
wilderness of 522,419 acres, surrounded by lesser-protected though
still technically wilderness USDA National Forest lands, adding
another million or so acres. Statistics say the GSMNP itself is the
most-visited of all U.S. national parks with nearly fourteen million
tourists per year,[fn:6] with additional tourist attractions and
accommodations all around the park boundaries. And what are these
visitors doing? Nothing like early-nineteenth-century Jane on her
moor. Only a tiny fraction are actually out on the park's extensive
wilderness trails hiking and camping. Most are either driving up and
down the main dissecting highway connecting Tennessee to North
Carolina or simply crowding into the visitor centres, again, via our
modern spaceship-like automobiles. Many years ago I visited on a
Fourth of July, stopping in the main tourist town bordering the park,
Gatlinburg, Tennessee, where the sidewalks were practically
standing-room-only. But later that same day I hiked for hours deep in
the park on the main Appalachian Trail and saw not another
human... Strange as this may sound, I say Jane's Yorkshire moorlands
are /real/ nature, while the Smokies are something else, simply
because of the sheer abstraction, the artificiality of their purpose,
not to mention their being so recognised, their well-known-ness
throughout the entire world.

To be sure, the Smokies are fussed and ruled over by legions of
scientists and bureaucrats at the behest of the U.S. Department of
Interior's National Park Service, UNESCO's World Heritage Convention,
the International Biosphere Programme, etc., like some great research
terrarium under an invisible glass dome. Even in the remotest,
genuinely wild spots many miles from any human disturbance, the weight
of humanity's lurking dominance, our collective mental presence is
inescapably massive... And so we have the dichotomy of discovered
versus undiscovered, exotic versus vernacular, integrated versus
detached, grounded versus abstract, thousands versus no matches to
googling. As the Rivers' guest, Jane Eyre described a natural and
organic connection to her moorland. And yet no modern tourist can ever
expect to become truly integrated with the GSMNP /complex/ as Jane was
with her moorlands.[fn:7] Lots more on what nature really means to us
later...

** My Dark /penchant/

Continuing, I am at a loss to explain my dark /penchant/ to those who
do not, cannot, will not get it. To be darkly inclined as I mean it is
a take-it-or-leave-it proposition; /either one gets Dark or one does
not/.[fn:8] Dark as I mean it was best presented and developed by
certain *poets* of the early-nineteenth century /Romantic/ Era,[fn:9]
an /emergent/ property, and a very special private corner of this
ultimately maligned and misunderstood time. I also believe /the Dark
Muse is best expressed in poetry/, but hardly ever as well in
prose. I, as well as many others of yore, believe that lyrical poetry
captures far more and drives far deeper than whatever can be lined up
in book-length chains of prose sentences. For example, it is almost as
if the poetess Emily Dickinson used words so very cryptically to
expose just how tenuous words really are. She routinely made strings
of words give up their ghosts just to swap in even more mysterious
ghosts---again, something really only doable with poetry. We'll
explore some of her amazing flights into /thoughts behind thoughts/
put to words as we go.

To be sure, my Dark Muse often comes on as a /feeling behind a
feeling/, subtle, maybe even profound, and yet fleeting, not availing
itself to logic-bound analysis or description or
intentionality.[fn:10] One very important principal, the German poet
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novalis][Novalis]], penname for Baron Friedrich von Hardenberg, often used a
unique /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_fragment][fragment]]/ writing style when describing his Dark Muse. And so
he abandoned even lyrical poetry to get yet again more bursty, more
spontaneous in order to capture the subtleties of his dark
impressions. Lots more about Novalis, the presumed founder of German
Romanticism, as we proceed. Dark stirrings arrive mostly unannounced,
a veritable surprise. *Dark is a gift*. Thus, my exploration of Dark
will rely heavily on the poetry of the preeminent Romantic Era
champions of the Dark Muse.

** Adding an extra wagon to the modern goth train

Of course I have an affinity with and feel a kinship to the
multifaceted modern goth subculture.[fn:11] And yet goth is one of the
elephants I feel I must shift a few inches from the centre of the
room. In very short, modern goths surely /sense/ Dark,[fn:12] but, for
whatever reasons, so many of them only see fit to express it, explore
it very narrowly through goth music and fashion. My Dark Muse would
hopefully include, be akin to what is today called goth and gothic,
/but I will try to go deeper and be more elemental/. If you are goth I
hope you allow me to speak to your "inner goth."

I believe there is a /natural darkness/ provided initially by Nature,
a basis upon which we may create symbols, artefacts, icons, trappings
to emulate, decorate, magnify, socialise, humanise, if nothing else,
/bring indoors/ this natural Dark. Yes to goth aesthetics, as far as
they may resonate, do honour to Dark. But too often our human take on
Dark unfortunately winds up overstated, overwrought---all the way out
to grimy, ignoble, silly, scummy, stupid.[fn:13] We imbibe, then
express what we see, experience, feel; but I say this process must be
done carefully, if not respectfully. And so I have to respectfully
downgrade, reorder so many of the /gothic/ horror fright memes, e.g.,
vampires, witches, demons; mean, nasty, menacing this, threatening,
evil that. Right up front: My Dark is not meant to shock or frighten,
rather, invite, deepen, and enrich. My Dark Muse contains nothing
cruel nor evil nor sinister nor satanic. As philosopher and
psychologist John Vervaeke said in describing the modern crisis of
anxiety and dysphoria, "Horror is the /aesthetic/ of when you feel
like you're losing your grip on reality." All right, I might dip my
toe in the lake of horror, as Alfred Hitchcock once said, but I
needn't dwell there too long. I do not want shock and terror to become
the default setting. And so mine is not the /Star Wars/ "dark side,"
not dark barbarism à la /Heart of Darkness/, and not the psychic dark
described by Freud or Jung. I cringe when someone says, "...and then
things took a /dark/ turn." Find a different adjective, please! In
general, let's drop the whole scary dark thing. Let's have a new
formula:

\begin{align*}
\large{\text{Dark} \ne \text{negative}}
\end{align*}

Yes, all right, once in a great while campy, over-the-top gothic can
be interesting, fun; but I'd rather not lose sight of the source,
however obscure and rare it may be.[fn:14] I'm after something more
subtle, discriminating, inward-personal ... perhaps like the small
natural sweet of a wild strawberry or raspberry versus the chemical
sweet blast of saccharine.[fn:15] Right. Nature over the synthetic,
the industrial. Basically, *my Dark is about the sublime*, indeed,
/sublimity/. And yes, I will eventually deal with Edmund Burke's (as
well as Bertrand Russell's) false, "they don't get it at all" tedium
on /sublimity/ later. In the meantime, /sublime/ is really just what
we may find beyond mere beauty, touching what Dostoevsky is saying
here

#+begin_quote
There are seconds, they only come five or six at a time, and you
suddenly feel the *presence of eternal harmony* (POEH) fully
achieved. It is nothing earthly; not that it is heavenly, but man
cannot endure it in his earthly state. One must change physically or
die. The feeling is clear and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense
the whole of nature and suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not
tenderheartedness, but simply joy.
#+end_quote

Awe ahead of joy? Again, much more fleshing out as we go along...

Allow me to hearken back to a golden era when Dark was the cultural
currency, i.e., roughly the first part of the nineteenth century, a
time when my key poets, my /principals/ --- Poe, Novalis, the Brontës
--- showed us how triste and Stygian can be so very subtle and
sublime. And most important to modern goths, I'm after something /I
will not outgrow/, rather, continue as my raison d'être sustaining me
to my grave. I say there must be no "aging out of the scene" as I fear
often happens with modern goth. Rather, the Dark Muse should be a
deepening and widening and transcendence for one's entire life.

** Dark like me?

Life would be empty, insipid, weak tea for me, every moment
rudderless, misspent, crushingly mundane were there not a strong and
constant current of the Dark Muse. It is as if nothing can be properly
understood without the dark perspective. But then I wonder, *is this
nature or nurture*?  That is to say, am I innately Dark, or is this
something to which I've been acculturated?[fn:16] I /feel/ it is the
former. One simply has dark inclinations, one either /feels/ the tug
of Dark---regardless of any sort of prepping or grooming---or one does
not.

Let's try a poetry litmus test. I present here a short, simple poem
from my main darkness benefactress, the poetess who stands at the
centre of everything I mean to say about Dark, the woman who rules me
from her grave, Emily Jane Brontë[fn:17]

#+begin_verse
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse

Here Emily of Haworth, West Yorkshire, is direct, blunt even. She
either speaks to something deep internal, or you are part of the
majority who will find it---weird, abnormal, /morbid/, overwrought,
puerile, even sick or evil. In my own life talking about my dark
/penchant/ has gotten mostly deer-in-headlights responses, if not
outright hostility. The openly peeved see my dark druthers as morose,
as wallowing in self-pity, attention seeking, dwelling on the
negative. I beg to differ. I say I'm not skewed to anything
particularly negative, morose, and certainly not morbid; rather, I
simply reject modern 24/7 cheeriness. Negative is a part
of real life, and this often hysteric spastic attempt to restrict life to
sunny-cheery happy-clappy is the real sickness in today's world. Alas
for all the "mental health professionals" who think they can "train
your brain to think positively."[fn:18]

Here is something a bit more relenting, but the same basic idea from
/Christina Rossetti/ [fn:19]

#+begin_verse
Fade tender lily,
Fade O crimson rose,
Fade every flower
Sweetest flower that blows.

Go chilly Autumn,
Come O Winter cold;
Let the green things die away
Into common mould.

Birth follows hard on death,
Life on withering:
Hasten, we shall come the sooner
Back to pleasant Spring.
#+end_verse

Rossetti is expressing the Dark Muse fatalistically, though she ends
with hope bound in humble expectancy. I like to think these two
English poetesses are expressing an informed, matured melancholy that
bespeaks a deeper understanding of life---all deriving from a deep
grasp of, homage to Dark.

And another poem, here Longfellow's /Snow-flakes/ from a collection
first published in 1863

#+begin_verse
Out of the bosom of the Air,
      Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,
Over the woodlands brown and bare,
      Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
            Silent, and soft, and slow
            Descends the snow.

Even as our cloudy fancies take
      Suddenly shape in some divine expression,
Even as the troubled heart doth make
      In the white countenance confession,
            The troubled sky reveals
            The grief it feels.

This is the poem of the air,
      Slowly in silent syllables recorded;
This is the secret of despair,
      Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,
            Now whispered and revealed
            To wood and field.
#+end_verse

Here I see Longfellow[fn:20] looking to the natural world and
/poetising/, to be sure, /darkly/. The idea of poetising, the
/poetisation/ of nature and life was central to the Romantic
Movement.[fn:21] This would be the poetry parallel to the
long-standing belief that we humans explain ourselves through, embed
our lives in narratives.[fn:22] And so despair, grief, misery are
transformed into more equanimous states of sadness and melancholy,
hopefully bringing us to a higher emotional maturity. In some
paradoxical way, nature and darkness eventually become healers ... as
if the initial agony and sorrow of life's cruel blows are like a
ravaging cancer or virus. Which may eventually fade into
remission. Which we can never entirely conquer, eliminate whilst on
Earth. Hence, some strange symbiosis must be struck... As I will explain,
being /mortal/ was an entirely different experience back then, back
when very few /thrived/, rather, mostly only /survived/.[fn:23]

This /poetising/ of Nature dark and mystical, this patient, reverent
knocking on Nature's door closed to us since the Fall from the Garden
of Eden, was the modus operandi of my select nineteenth-century
poets. Rather than avoid, they sought out, /embraced/ their Dark Muse,
something we today in our brightly-lit, cordoned-off world usually
think of as bad, counter-productive, even dangerous. I contend we have
lost this subtle art of moving hardship, tragedy, emotional crises
into a stasis remission melancholy. Today, we vilify and wage
full-scale war against any and all recurring melancholia with
psychoanalysis and prescription psychopharmacology drugs. /Instead of
hysterically rushing in to counter "negative" thoughts with "positive"
thoughts, better to find a higher perspective on the inevitability of
the negative in life, no?/ Really though, there is an unnaturalness to
chivvying a person into suppressing sad thoughts, to bombing the brain
with synthetic biochemistry. There is a desperate, embarrassing,
intelligence-insulting triteness to "cheerful at all costs." Indeed,
cheeriness as a gateway drug... And so all too often we are failures
at finding a /modus vivendi/[fn:24] vis-à-vis the trials and
tribulations of life as our ancestors once did. /Fazit/[fn:25]: When
the negative is suppressed, we become exposed to a myriad of psychic
maladies. Better I say to find some dignity through Dark
aesthetics. Which, again, is exactly what our ancestors did. Another
Fazit: There is meaning in pain---and even deeper meaning in /more/
pain. They knew this back in the day. So spoiled on the illusions and
expectations of easy modern life, we've lost sight of this fact.

*** To suffer...

Let's hear from another of my principals, Emily Elizabeth
Dickinson[fn:26]

#+begin_verse
After great pain, a formal feeling comes ---
The Nerves sit ceremonious, like Tombs ---
The stiff Heart questions ‘was it He, that bore,’
And ‘Yesterday, or Centuries before’?

The Feet, mechanical, go round ---
A Wooden way
Of Ground, or Air, or Ought ---
Regardless grown,
A Quartz contentment, like a stone ---

This is the Hour of Lead ---
Remembered, if outlived,
As Freezing persons, recollect the Snow ---
First --- Chill --- then Stupor --- then the letting go ---
#+end_verse

In her day, life was a struggle---with entropy, adversity, depression,
with Death ready to lap over the gunwales of a person's little
lifeboat at any time. Emily Dickinson of mid-1800s Amherst,
Massachusetts, relates human suffering in a severe and fatalistic yet
grounded way by pulling me into a dark place where I am suddenly
thrown into reliance on alternative, finer, higher
sensibilities. Again, all we may ever do in our lives is disperse,
reorder the initially searing, inescapable pain of travesty to a dull,
hopefully diluted ache in the ever-growing backdrop of time. We never
"win" the race, but perhaps we do get recognition for
participating---first and foremost from ourselves, then from the
network of fellow humans around us.[fn:27]

As Emily of Amherst said in a letter /...but to all except anguish the
mind soon adjusts/. Again I must say the subject of pain, suffering,
and loss was far better conducted in the past than they are
today. How, why? Because first and foremost they did not attempt to
contain, disguise, systematise, drug, or /process/ greif; rather,
greif was faced directly, /pain was shared/, empathy a way of
interconnecting in a healthy communal life. And so emotional space was
allotted, support was natural, organic, openly shared. Strikingly
different from today was their acceptance of /doom/[fn:28] and fate,
two concepts antithetical to our dynamic, positivist,
self-determining, fix and paper over everything quickly modern
ways. This, in turn, led most to faith in God and acceptance of His
will.

#+begin_quote
The soul must go by Death alone, so, it must by life, if it is a soul. \\
---Emily Dickinson
#+end_quote

...alluding to The soul as an entity of both life and
death. Indeed. Especially death was handled so very differently back
then. Consider Queen Victoria[fn:29] who wore mourning black from the
time of her husband Prince Albert's death in 1861 until the end of her
life in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg who upon losing her
husband Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. In those days death was properly, officially mourned. No one
tried to hustle mourners along with their grief and sadness. Contrast
this with today's all-too-prevalent disassociation, the confused
emotional shutdown, the disorganised quasi-denial and suppression we
moderns too often show towards death[fn:30]. For the early nineteenth
century, poetising life's train of tragedy was /depression
deconstruction/ as a life skill. The slings and arrows of human
existence found conjunction with /Nature/, /Dark/, and /Faith/ through
poetry, thereby highlighting, elevating, /ennobling/ our uniquely
human experience on Earth, thereby *casting a gossamer of sublimity
over our natural existence like no other generation before or
since*. Theirs was the deepest soundings of our humanness that I know,
and, thus, something I must pursue and showcase here.

** But again, why Dark?

Still, why Dark? Because Dark speaks to me. How? Why? Lack of a clear
and simple answer forces me into a regrettably wordier one. I might
say Dark remains mysterious---no matter how many different angles from
which I try to express it. Dark is something instinctual, cathartic,
evocative, centring for me. Dark is more than the lack of light. Dark
can lead the imagination to riot. The moss, lichens, and mushrooms in
the secretive shadows of the forest incite so much more than the
spectacular sunny vista across the forest valley. Really though, I'm
just not into spectacular...

The fresh-cut rose elicits a simple response, but the faded rose
another---deeper, sobering, but never "depressing," at least not for
me. Here is something from my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ [fn:31]

#+begin_quote
The new cut rose: initially beautiful, thereafter dried and
desiccated, lost forever its initial delicate beauty and
fragrance. Once affording a glimpse of perfection, only reminiscent
thereafter. Beauty always some fleeting illusion or madness? Moreover
its eclipse, joining, leading the shadows of our relentless doom, our
march to the grave. And though I live in this momentary brilliance, I
still search my night shore; for until now I have known only of
beauty’s haunting rumour, of love’s promise, those slightest
quickenings of things necessarily rare and formerly peripheral. Yes,
in this moment I may have some of love’s bliss, of roses' beauty, but
I know I shall cherish with a larger, more settled heart the memories
thereof, echoes sent down life’s long, clouded memory hall as true and
lasting blessings.

Yes, I might have received a nod of approval back in the day, perhaps
a pat on the back...

Let's see another example of Dark get-it-or-don't, this time another
poem from Emily Dickinson, her /There's a certain slant of
light/[fn:32]

#+begin_verse
There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons — 
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes --- 

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us --- 
We can find no scar, 
But internal difference --- 
Where the Meanings, are --- 

None may teach it – Any --- 
'Tis the seal Despair --- 
An imperial affliction 
Sent us of the Air --- 

When it comes, the Landscape listens --- 
Shadows --- hold their breath --- 
When it goes, 'tis like the Distance 
On the look of Death --- 
#+end_verse

Let that sink in for a while... The last line includes /Death/
capitalised.[fn:33] Again, I must emphasise how these
nineteenth-century artists approached human mortality so differently
than we do today. As I'm saying, this past-century view of Death has
largely gone lost. I hope to rediscover it. I'll start by positing
their understanding of Death was integral to their understanding of
Nature...

** Pre-modern Nature and Death

#+begin_quote
Travel why to Nature, when she dwells with us? Those who lift their
hats shall see her, as devout do God. \\
    ---Emily Dickinson
#+end_quote

Here are the main points towards a new understanding of Nature:
+ True nature is the myriad cycles of /birth, growth, deterioration,
  and death/ happening constantly everywhere, full stop, nothing
  else...
+ ...ergo, /nature is not a place/, no indoors versus outdoors,
  rather, a state of being, life and death, existence itself...
+ ...ergo, no increase or degression of nature, rather, nature
  constant ubiquitous...
+ ...ergo, death is an integral part of true Nature.
+ ...and so this increasingly extra-natural, quasi-immortal modern
  human flies in the face of true Nature.
+ Many Romantic Era poets tapped into real Nature, this in contrast to
  our modern triumphalist aloof grandiosities, our complete
  estrangement from nature as separate and locational, thus, optional.

I hold that our modern, twenty-first-century understanding of nature
is very different than Nature of early-nineteenth-century poets such
as William and Dorothy Wordsworth, or John Clare, or the Haworth and
Amherst Emilies.[fn:34] Alone the fact that our modern indoor living
environments are more like modular, sealed /space stations/ plopped
down on an alien planet compared to the simpler, more primitive
structures of the not-so-distant past... Quite literally, the Brontës'
Haworth parsonage, built in 1778 out of local stone and wood and clay,
had more in common with human shelters from one, /two/ thousand years
previous than with our modern suburban homes only some two hundred
years later.

Hence, /in just the past two to three hundred years a very steep,
vertical gradient or differential has grown between so-called indoors
and outdoors/. This, in turn, has brought us to see nature more as a
/place/ separate and outside, cut off, away from our artificial,
sterile, high-tech, controlled and regulated modern indoor
spaces[fn:35] ... which, in turn, has lead us to rate /nature
outdoors/ on continua of relative wildness and remoteness from our
sealed-off, self-contained, humans-only environments. And so I ask,
Who is the person in the image above walking down that hall?

<span class="cap">Homespun and one of its sources. Original art from Steve-Lease (DeviantArt.com)</span>@@
@@html:</span>@@

Even as late as my own childhood the term /homespun/ was in use to
indicate a poor, unsophisticated person, a country bumkin, a hick from
the sticks. The term referred to the inferiority of a person's
clothing being homemade from locally-sourced, hand-spun and woven
materials such as linen and wool rather than factory-made retail
clothing. The early-nineteenth century Brontëan West Yorkshire would
have seen the majority of the villagers in homespun, all but a few
garments not hand-tailored bespoke.[fn:36] And of course food was
entirely from local production. Hence, a person's daily resources were
overwhelmingly local, a small bit perhaps coming from a nearby /market
town/, while only the most exotic items (e.g., a clock, a fine musical
instrument) would have come from farther away. Today, however, this
supply pyramid is completely flipped, as nearly everything comes from
far (far!) away (e.g. China), while only a few personal items would be
from a local or even regional source.[fn:37] And so in Brontëan times
(first half of the 1800s) much of the surrounding lands were
agriculturally domesticated, a working partner, so to say. Contrast
this with today's urban-suburban populations hardly ever in contact
with farmers or their farms. Nor do we know anything about where our
clothing comes from. Today, "the land" as our immediate provider has
been completely abstracted into concepts such as /ecosystem/ and
/biosphere/, which imply we are now removed scientific observers
controlling nature as if it were just another of our mechanical
objects.

No doubt we have always made a distinction between being /inside/ a
shelter and going /outside/ into the so-called /elements/. But
starting some six to ten thousand years ago we began to give up
aboriginal nomadic life and its direct daily contact with said
untamed, uncontrolled elements in order to establish permanent
city-states supported by mass monoculture agriculture. And so indoor
environments in ever-expanding urban centres became increasingly
physically removed, walled off from the wild natural world, becoming
evermore self-contained, all-encompassing, self-referencing, thus,
/recursively derivative/.[fn:38]

Along with this growing separation came mentalities, narratives,
collective social-psychological "mindspaces" increasingly urban-based,
thus, uniquely /extra-natural/.[fn:39] Being so completely indoors
meant we no longer were in direct contact with the aboriginal animist
nature spirits all around; instead, praying to an extra-natural,
off-world monotheistic God in architecturally showcase
churches.[fn:40] Western architecture seemed to reach a fantastical
aesthetic crescendo in the Victorian nineteenth century, ironically
with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as one of the a leading
styles. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were some
manner of nostalgic revivalist (Greek, Gothic, Italianate,
Elizabethan, Queen Anne, etc.), perhaps hearkening back to times more
integrated with nature, i.e., shallower gradients between indoors and
outdoors. This coincided with the exponential growth in urban
population having just passed an inflection point. And so today we see
the steepness of our indoor-outdoor gradient has accelerated even
more, resulting in a humanity more /extra-natural/ than ever, billions
of people in an all but permanently abstract social-psychological
spaces. How then may we, a species seemingly capable of great
adaptability, measure with any objectivity our separation from nature?
But then what exactly is human adaptability? I posit there are two
sorts of adaptability

 a) Permanent thus beneficial alteration, or
 b) temporary adjustment, i.e., an allowance for less-that-optimal
    conditions, supposing an eventual return to optimal conditions.

We humans, I contend, are the second type of adaptable. And this means
we are not truly adaptable at all, rather, only capable of making
temporary adjustments to bad conditions. Thus, we are certainly no
barometer species or "canary in the coal mine" of our own
well-being. In fact, /we routinely ignore our fellow canary-like
humans/, allowing them to suffer and die, their non-adaptations
unheeded if not condemned as weakness. What has domestic, urban,
indoor living done to our brains, our sense of belonging to the
planet, to one another?[fn:41] How can we even begin to trace back up
the many rabbit hole bifurcations, the chain of derivatives we've
taken for all these centuries down and out and away from direct
interaction and response to /Natur pur/?

To be sure, we have demonstrated an amazing collective will to make
conditions better for ourselves /and for us alone/. We've set up the
entire planet to be a department store strictly for us, /then we've
looted and ransacked our own department store!/ We even accept our
dominion over, abstraction away, separation from nature as fate, as a
sort of exceptionalist, triumphalist destiny. After all, our
population doubling in less than fifty years to eight billion[fn:42]
says something to our intention, our ability to dominate. And we have
thrown every effort towards, have adapted our collective human psyche,
our narratives to this separation.[fn:43] /But is this sustainable?/
All doomsday spinnings aside, many of us today have grown concerned
over the question of sustainability, concerned about our long arc of
estrangement from nature.[fn:44] Let me repeat from above a completely
different understanding of nature, namely

#+begin_quote
Nature is not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature is everything going on everywhere. Nature is the myriad cycles
of *birth*, *growth*, *deterioration*, and *death* happening
everywhere all the time.
#+end_quote

I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, knew, or
at least /sensed/ this pre-modern meaning of Nature as above and
beyond inside or outside. Yes, one went /outside/, out into the
"elements." But once back indoors, a Brontë sister was not so
completely out of and above nature's touch, influence, /doom/ (i.e.,
the deterioration and death part) as we now fancy ourselves. Again,
the cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and especially death were
happening everywhere /sans emplacement/.

Consider how the Industrial Revolution created urban production
landscapes vast and barren, vast, seemingly endless landscapes so
completely alien and devoid of any sort of nature, spatial or
otherwise---indeed, William Blake's "satanic mills." Here is what
German philosopher Ludwig Klages of the late-1800s said

#+begin_quote
The face of the land has become a landscape of coerced
"Chicago-ifications" as humanity has fallen into an orgy of
destruction without precedence. So-called civilization wears the face
of an unleashed murderer, while the fullness, the bounty of the earth
has withered from his poisonous breath.
#+end_quote

And an equally hard-hitter from another German, Günter Grass

#+begin_quote
We already have the statistics for the future: the growth percentages
of pollution, overpopulation, desertification. The future is already
in place.
#+end_quote

This was a change on a scale never before seen, a huge and relatively
sudden step away from the physical world as the purveyance of
nature. And even when the modern individual left the confines of an
indoor space, he was still deep within a massive concentration of
extra-natural, human-exclusive structure, logistics, and activity
... which made peasant life---as hardscrabble as it might have
been---in the pre-industrial rural landscape all but idyllic compared
the grueling, grinding poverty of the soul-emptying industrial
cityscapes.[fn:45] 

Here is an excerpt from Emily Brontë's /Shall earth no more inspire
thee/ where Mother Nature speaks directly to the wayward human

#+begin_verse
...Thy mind is ever moving
In regions dark to thee;
Recall its useless roving---
Come back and dwell with me.
#+end_verse

I can never read this poem without having a very emotional
response. Indeed, the house of mirrors echo chamber that modern life
has become blocks Nature and precludes any reality. And so the choice
is simple: We can go back to Nature /or/ continue our useless roving,
which can only lead to evermore alienation---from real Nature, as well
as from each other.

To be sure, so much ominous and doomsdayish has been said about our
mass society in this modern industrialised world---all pointing to the
increasingly obvious fact that our vaunted adaptation skills are being
stretched to the breaking point, collective mental dysphoria
increasing as a total ecological collapse approaches.

Here again Emily Brontë, her epic /The night is darkening round
me/[fn:46]

#+begin_verse
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow;
But a tyrant spell has bound me,
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;
The storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below;
But nothing drear can move me;
I will not, cannot go.
#+end_verse

This the heart of my darkness. Yes, she is outdoors "facing the
elements," as we say. She even refers to the wilds as "wastes" and as
"drear."[fn:47] And yet she is transfixed, frozen to the spot---and
cannot, cannot go. Subjective terms like wastes and drear refer to the
age-old attitudes towards nature as a terrible, grim, inescapable
master, a sponsor of disaster and death, hardly over which to linger,
let alone wax poetic. But surprisingly, my Romantic Era poets did just
that, and to be sure, the grandeur and sublimity of Nature was the
surprising result. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared
directly at an enemy previously known as all-powerful and unforgiving,
and in so doing she sensed something deep and personally
transformative. /She was stirred to write lines that, for me at least,
are the very centre of the mystery of Life, Death, and the Dark Muse./

Let us now contrast Brontëan Nature with Ernest Hemingway's
twentieth-century take on nature. Hemingway and his contemporaries
rambled hither and yon over the globe trying to find the ultimate
nature experience. He attempted to dominate, to force his will upon
nature to prove his power, his worthiness as a man. I contend this was
at best some strange sacrificial ritual to nature,[fn:48] at worst,
just an act, theatre, creating drama. After all, if anything serious
had happened to him he could have been airlifted out to receive modern
medical care---and occasionally was the case.

Though not the Romantic Era poets, who lived their entire lives in
harm's way with no timeouts, no escape. Would Hemingway have done all
those chest-pounding, macho-man things if there had been no modern
world with modern medical aid just an airlift away? Haworth Emily
lived in a time when /nothing/ was modern; hence, even her
circumscribed West Yorkshire moorlands were actually a
semi-wilderness. Consider how early eighteenth-century medicine had no
understanding of germs.[fn:49] Quite literally, a cut on a toe could
become infected, resulting in amputation, even death in those
times. Nature for a Brontë sister was not a contest, a rite of
passage, a show or game on a borrowed fresh-air stage. They weren't
out to prove anything to a modern audience.

** Death beyond malfunction

With Nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around us, the last two components, deterioration
and death, must be understood beyond our mechanistic reductionist
modern take of just physical malfunction.[fn:50] We must consider
Death capitalised.

Back in the day, Death was a /force majeure/---but no longer thanks to
modern medicine. It's almost as if deterioration and Death, two of
nature's supposedly inescapable realities, have been cordoned off---or
at least placed under much greater human control than ever
before. /It's as if through modern medicine we have begun to acquire a
demi-godlike, proto-immortal veto power over physical demise./ And
with this control we have begun to tear down, dismantle a great
component of spirituality, namely the reckoning of one's mortality
with a deity, with an afterlife. Where once was supposed a /mortal/,
physical plane inferior to an /immortal/ spiritual plane, we now would
believe only the physical plane relevant, we, of course, its eventual
total masters. But with this hubris comes a great psychic and spiritual
impoverishment, the extent of which we do not fully realise.
Allow me another Amherst Emily quote

#+begin_verse
Life is Death we're lengthy at
Death the hinge to Life
#+end_verse

For the meantime, however, death still remains an undeniable
certainty. Death comes as it always has---from old age, fatal
accident, or deadly physical aggression or predation.[fn:51] But a
completely different attitude arises when modern healthcare's
labyrinth of diagnoses, drugs, procedures, surgeries, /interventions/
routinely thwart what was once all but a certain, if not swift
demise. We have seriously disrupted the schedule of Death, and so we've
begun to lessen the mystery of Death, overturn fate, consequence, and
doom. We've become lengthier at life, oiling and oiling Dickenson's
hinge...

#+begin_verse
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
--- Psalm 90:10
#+end_verse

This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalistic,
absolute inevitability so resounding as to constantly shake and echo
back into life. Death as life's backstop, container, timer,
revelator,[fn:52] combinator, shaper, /reaper/.[fn:53] And so I say,
as Death is interrupted, so are the greater human cycles of emotion
and spirituality interrupted ... meaning if Death is also adjustable,
as Emily Dickinson said it /wasn't/, then we are slashing blindly at
the very fabric of reality.

Indeed, what if we start to take over Death's appointment book,
rerouting, rescheduling Death's comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is
making the point that by no means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty
years of life, and even if we get them they might not be that
great. And yet we have grown to /expect/ from the implicit promises of
modern medical science a healthy, high-quality seventy, eighty,
ninety, or even more years. Again, modern medicine has disrupted the
two last components of Nature ubiquitous cyclic, i.e., deterioration
and death, thereby further collapsing our understanding of what true
Nature is. Modern science has lessened, confused, disrupted the wallop
of tragedy, weakened the overall doominess of doom by redefining life
as just so much carbon-based machine circuitry, a mechanism that is to
be better and better repaired, maintained, improved against entropic
wear-and-tear---until we are literally immortal.[fn:54]

Allow me to relate a modern story touching on our new attitude towards
Death. My father, who has since passed away, lost his /third/ wife to
lung cancer inevitably caused by decades of smoking.[fn:55] But
instead of accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst from a college-educated man?
I eventually theorised that from all the buzz surrounding the various
possible medical interventions---including their probabilities of
success or failure---he had begun to expect the death sentence of lung
cancer could, /should/ be beaten by some technology lurking in some
corner of the modern medical mega-factory. Death was not the
long-anticipated reunion with the Creator, rather, a trigger of enmity
and recriminations over the failure of scientific procedures and
medications. Alas...

Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed Death's arrival to
such an absurd degree. Again, human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of Death /expected/ to lap over at any time. But
today the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has become an implicitly
guaranteed minimum. Old age and death are increasingly spoken of as
"diseases" we can and should defeat. Death as a nuisance, indeed. My
father felt cheated when that three-, fourscore and more was not
forthcoming for his wife. But as you may anticipate, I contend life is
truly life only with Death---Death absolute and not easily pushed
back, much less manipulated or obviated.

A sickly Anne Brontë[fn:56] on her final dying trip to Scarborough in
1849 made a stop in York where she insisted on seeing the York
Minster. Upon gazing up at the great cathedral she said, "If finite
power can do this..."  But then she was overcome with emotion and fell
silent. /Dying Anne was in a deep and personal death mindset of utter
and complete humility and reverence./[fn:57]

In my (unpublished) novel /Emily of Wolkeld/, the character Annette
says yes to the question posed by Emily of whether she would go back
to Brontëan times in a time machine. Emily then asks Annette, "But
what if you faced a fifty-fifty chance of dying from a now curable,
fixable condition?" Annette replies, "I would /trust/ my life, and
/trust/ my death." To be sure, my father did not trust his wife's
death. How utterly sad.

*** Teenage(!) Dickinson's cemetery visit

Allow me to insert a passage from a letter Emily Dickinson wrote to
her friend Abiah Root in 1846 when she was only sixteen years of
age. She describes a visit to Boston and the first true American
cemetery, Mount Auburn.[fn:58]

#+begin_quote
Have you ever been to Mount Auburn? If not, you can form but slight
conception of this "City of the Dead." It seems as if nature had
formed this spot with a distinct idea in view of its being a
resting-place for her children, where, wearied and disappointed, they
might stretch themselves beneath the spreading cypress, and close
their eyes "calmly as to a night's repose, or flower's at set of sun."
#+end_quote

...teenager Amherst Emily feeling the Dark Muse. Here is one of her
many poems about Death

#+begin_verse
The distance that the dead have gone
Does not at first appear ---
Their coming back seems possible
For many an ardent year.

And then, that we have followed them,
We more than half suspect,
So intimate have we become
With their dear retrospect.
#+end_verse

That we in life are "following the dead" is a perspective we have lost
and has brought us great poverty of the soul.

...and probably Haworth Emily's most moving elegiac lines about (one
of) her deceased sister(s) in her grave--- /Song/

#+begin_verse
The linnet in the rocky dells,
     The moor-lark in the air
The bee among the heather bells
     That hide my lady fair:

The wild deer browse above her breast;
     The wild birds raise their brood;
And they her smiles of love caressed
     Have left her solitude!

I ween that, when the grave's dark wall
     Did first her form retain,                
They thought their hearts could ne'er recall
     The light of joy again.

They thought the tide of grief would flow
     Unchecked through future years;
But where is all their anguish now,
     And where are all their tears?

Well, let them fight for honor's breath,
     Or pleasure's shade pursue---
The dweller in the land of death
     Is changed and careless too.               

And, if their eyes should watch and weep
     Till sorrow's source were dry,
She would not, in her tranquil sleep,
     Return a single sigh!

Blow, west-wind, by the lonely mound,
     And murmur, summer-streams---
There is no need of other sound
     To soothe my lady's dreams.
#+end_verse

Indeed, a human being human about Death...

** Night and Death according to Novalis

#+begin_quote
The world must be romanticised. In this way we will find again its
primal meaning. Romanticising is nothing but raising to a higher power
in a qualitative sense. In this process the lower Self becomes
identified with a better Self ... When I give a lofty meaning to the
commonplace, a mysterious prestige to the usual, the dignity of the
unknown to the known, an aura of infinity to the finite, then I am
romanticising. For the higher, the unknown, the mystical, the
infinite, the process is reversed---these are---expressed in terms of
their logarithms by such a connection---they are---reduced to familiar
terms.
#+end_quote

This is an oft-cited quote from[fn:59] the German nobleman George
Philipp Friedrich /Freiherr/ (Baron) von Hardenberg (1772---1801), pen
name *[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novalis][Novalis]]*, who is considered to be the original muse of the
German Romantic Movement ... paralleling similar ideals and sentiments
in Britain,[fn:60] which quickly spread throughout the
English-speaking diaspora and the West in general. Specifically, his
prose-poem cycle /Hymns to the Night/ [fn:61] electrified people
around him, initially a gathering of German salon intellectuals in
Jena, Thuringia, Germany.[fn:62] These thinkers rallied around
Novalis, whom they adopted as a sort of naïf mascot, spring-boarding
from /HttN/ and Novalis' /poetising/, another term he used for the
romanticising of life. Indeed, what came to be known as Jena
Romanticism[fn:63] spread to eager circles and fertile grounds
throughout the West. They raised Novalis' idealisations of
/Poesie/ [fn:64] as an all-embracing paradigm to counter the cold,
dehumanising, thus /desensitising/ implications of Enlightenment Age
rationalism and determinism, as well as the stultifying formalisms, as
well as triumphalist imperialism of Classicism. Novalis sounded the
charge to /re-sensitise/ the human being. Here is a quote about one of
the Jena Set's central figures, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilhelm_Schlegel][August Schlegel]] to give a quick
preliminary idea of what German Romanticism was about---

#+begin_quote
It is widely accepted that the Romantic Movement in Germany emerged,
on the one hand, as a reaction against the aesthetical ideals defended
in Classicism and Neoclassicism, and on the other, as a deviation from
the rational principles of the Enlightenment with the consequent
regression to the irrational spirit of the Middle Ages.

Schlegel argues that, from a philosophical point of view, everything
participates in an ongoing process of creation, whereas, from an
empirical point of view, natural things are conceived as if they were
dead, fixed and independent from the whole.
#+end_quote

Alas, but here is where I become quite the iconoclast, primarily by
insisting /academe has Romanticism wrong!/ Even Novalis'
supporters, his Jena contemporaries, yes, even Novalis himself seemed
to lose the thread and march about spouting dessicated
intellectualisations.[fn:65] /I posit that Novalis with his
foundational HttN took off like a sleepwalker towards the Dark
Muse/. However, Romanticism, as subsequently cooked up by "experts"
during and after, became a bloated, overanalysed, theory-bound,
cart-before-the-horse disaster. Or I will simply say, German
Romanticism began true but veered off into the ditch---all while
Wordsworthian English Romanticism never really emphasised Dark with
much intention, except for Coleridge's gothic borrowings from the
eighteenth century.[fn:66]

I contend my principal poets were like a great river broken into
multiple braided channels across a broad landscape with little to
intellectualise about other than wetness. And so my whole point with
WutheriingUK is to urge you to simply *read, sigh, reflect---repeat*
the lines writtien by my principals (Brontës, Dickinson, Poe, Keats,
Wordsworth, Clare, et al.) and not follow any of the scholarly
technocrats down their musty, mildewy rabbit holes where the spirit of
it all quickly suffocates. Of course this may seem naive, context-free
and amateurish of me, but the alternative is winding up lost and
clueless as I believe the vast majority of Romanticism scholars
are. Academe Romanticism is truly the blind leading the blind. Duly
warned, let's get into /HttN/ and why it is so important.

Reading /HttN/ one cannot escape the sheer intensity of Novalis'
swoon-fest over Night and Death. Here is a small taste

#+begin_verse
I feel the flow of
Death's youth-giving flood;
To balsam and æther, it
Changes my blood!
I live all the daytime
In faith and in might:
And in holy rapture
I die every night.
#+end_verse

and just before came

#+begin_verse
What delight, what pleasure offers /thy/ life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night? Thy mother, it is she brings thee forth, and to her thou owest all thy glory.
#+end_verse

It my opinion /HttN/ is one of the densest, purest, most direct
attesting to the Dark Muse ever.[fn:67] As the legend tells, his
inspiration came from being grief-stricken at the death of his
fifteen-year-old fiancée Sophie von Kühn,[fn:68] to whose grave he
made a pilgrimage for one hundred nights. The Jena Set writer Ludwig
Tieck described the teenage Sophie

#+begin_quote
Even as a child, she gave an impression which---because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely---we must call super-earthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.
#+end_quote

Indeed, Sophie was the mascot of the mascot, an angelic being of
singular feminine mystique inspiring great feelings and words.[fn:69]
And it was her death that threw Novalis into a state of mind which, in
turn, proved to be the catalyst for so many others. But as I must
insist, /HttN/ was not just the gymnastics of flipping the sacred to
profane, the profane to sacred as Novalis himself described
romanticising poetising. He journeyed into Night and came back with
some of the most compelling Dark ever. But immediately thereafter
there yawned open a great abyss between the actual talent, the
producers on the one hand and describer-promoters on the other, i.e.,
Novalis' friends who became known as the Jena Romanticists. We'll
explore why so many of Novalis' contemporaries and nearly all of his
researchers did not "get" his Dark.

** John Keats' sense of Beauty

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge][Samuel Taylor Coleridge]][fn:70] is generally accepted as the leading
intellectualiser of early British Romanticism, its inception roughly
parallel to the Jena Romantic liftoff. Following is a Coleridge quote
as good as any

#+begin_quote
...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each
other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the
accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as
the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible
directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces
should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike
indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible
yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which
their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and
the process of our own self-consciousness.
#+end_quote

Indeed, such wordy intellectualisations are the usual fodder seized
upon by latter-day academes whipping up their own word salad
copy. Yes, Coleridge and Wordsworth's /Lyrical Ballads/ is considered
the cornerstone of English Romanticism with its clearly poetising of
Nature. But as I say, these men do not seem to possess dark
proclivities or feel much inclined to express the Dark Muse---least of
all Coleridge.

Now, let us consider what English poet John Keats said years
later in a 1817 letter to his brothers George and Thomas

#+begin_quote
...I mean *Negative Capability*, that is, when a man is capable of
being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
reaching after fact and reason---Coleridge, for instance, would let go
by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of
mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with
half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no
further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty
overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all
consideration.
#+end_quote

Keats repudiates hard and fast ideas battling it out for
supremacy. Intellectualisations, great and lengthy, especially of the
"Penetralium[fn:71] of mystery," are just so much verisimilar[fn:72]
ramblings to him. Indeed, to /not/ immediately intellectualise, but to
hold oneself in that maddeningly counter-intuitive suspended state of
unresolved---just to see where it might lead---is Keats' great
insight. Feelings and impressions and what-ifs must be gently,
carefully raised up out of the mental ruckus. To be sure, /Negative
Capability/ is about living with /cognitive dissonance/, that such
frustrations is the great and necessary burden the poet must carry, a
mental control technique key towards deeper insights and
understanding. And so the poet must fly beyond the neat and tidy piles
of logical-seeming words to reach a higher place. Keats obviates any
and all academic intellectualisms with his simple ode to Beauty. Here
is the famed beginning of his "poetic romance" /Endymion/[fn:73]

#+begin_verse
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
#+end_verse

Take that Coleridge, you babbling, brachial braincase! Again, *read,
sigh, reflect---repeat.* Let Keats sink in, dear reader. Perhaps
picture Endymion in some pre-historical Arcadia sleeping under a tree. 

In the 2009 film /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_Star_(film)][Bright Star]]/, a touching verisimilar bio-drama about
Keats, there is a scene where, speaking to his love interest Fanny
Brawne, he says

#+begin_quote
A poet is not at all poetical. In fact, he the most unpoetical thing
in existence. He has no identity. He is continually filling some other
body---the sun, the moon... Poetic craft is a carcass, a
sham. *If poetry does not come as naturally as leaves to a tree then
it had better not come at all*.
#+end_quote

...and then Fanny says, /I still don't know how to work out a poem./
To which Keats says[fn:74]

#+begin_quote
A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving
in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the
lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not /work/ the
lake out. It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and
emboldens the soul to accept mystery.
#+end_quote

And thus I would posit he did not see Romanticism as something needs
bundling and explaining and stuck with labels and herded into
categories. The point of hearing birdsong is not to think about male
birds warding off other males whilst trying to appeal to females, but
to luxuriate in the wonderful chorus of nature.[fn:75] Time and time
again I listen to or read a description of Romanticism and come away
feeling how the scholar understood nothing qualitatively, rather, is
simply stringing disparate bits and bobs together towards some
verisimilitude of penetralia they don't really get or understand. And
so I say the intellectual prison in which academe has stuck
Romanticism should be opened up, the guards soundly switched and run
off, the prisoners let back out into the wide fields and deep woods
where they might be beyond thought.

** Thriving versus surviving; top dog versus underdog

In his book /The Genius of Instinct/ [fn:76] author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to /thrive/, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural nesting in rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, /but wait/,
haven't these bats jumped /outside/ of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of /trans/-bat-ism. But is this good for
nature as a whole? In effect, the bats have short-circuited their
doom, their fate. And so I ask, what are the real long-term
consequences of this cheat?

Perhaps bats doing marginally better is not too much of an imbalance
vis-a-vis the rest of their competitors and surrounding
environment.[fn:77] But what happens when a species keeps on
"thriving" more and more, increasing its success statistics, stepping
over, beyond any of the natural restrictions that /total/ integration
and harmony with nature would have required? /Aren't we humans Exhibit
A of just such an out-of-control species?/ And so I ask, how can all
this so-called thriving be good, end well?  How can a dominant species
like ours---which always seems to be "gaming the system," using the
entire planet as our exclusive, one-species department store, evermore
ingeniously and aggressively extra-natural---not eventually have to
pay some price?  Simply put, How can more and more people consuming
more and more resources and energy, each of us full of fantasies about
success and prosperity, not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?

Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to, locked down in its tightly integrated
niche, then exponential growth ensues---which eventually must hit an
inflexion point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards
an inevitable overshoot and crash.

I bring this up because, to my mind, Emily Brontë was just this sort
of hard-pressed little bat out in the wilds---colony-less, huddled
under a rock, barely eking out a marginal life. Here is her /Plead for
me/

#+begin_verse
Why I have persevered to shun
The common paths that others run;
And on a strange road journeyed on
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.

These once indeed seemed Beings divine,
And they perchance heard vows of mine
And saw my offerings on their shrine—
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,
And mine were worthily despised;

My Darling Pain that wounds and sears
And wrings a blessing out from tears
By deadening me to real cares;
And yet, a king---though prudence well
Have taught thy subject to rebel.

And am I wrong to worship where
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me
And tell why I have chosen thee!
#+end_verse

It doesn't sound like Emily was "living her best life" in the modern
sense. I consider this her ode to skipping the unnatural trans-human
thrive scene of her day and striking out into some Beyond to commune
with her God of Visions. Again, I must believe she was a little bat
fluttering across the semi-wilderness moorland, a true existential
/underdog/ definitely /not/ thriving, rather, a quasi-equal of all the
other underdog wild critters, as was still marginally possible back
then.

Compare this with today's outdoor adventurer who, clad in "technical"
gear from REI, Patagonia, North Face, drives to government set-aside
wilds such as the Smokies mentioned above in a four-wheel-drive Jeep
Cherokee, consumes protein bars and electrolyte drinks, listens to
appropriate New Age music with earbuds, takes smart phone pictures and
GoPro videos. Any serious mishaps? Call for immediate helicopter
rescue on the iPhone satellite connection... At some point we're just
amateur Earth astronauts like Katy Perry on a Blue Origin flight into
sub-space, no? When nature is truly in balance, /all/ participants are
underdogs to some degree. But not us modern humans. We have demanded
and gained all but total dominance over nature. We see ourselves above
and beyond nature. But where does that leave us? Outside of nature
looking in, looking back, babbling on with borrowed New Age spiritual
grandiosities, pretending to have some connection that was severed
long ago. Imagine a divorced man who calls his ex-wife daily. This is
us with nature.

Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced malnutrition, contaminated
water, tuberculosis---pick one, two, or all three---five months after
her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the greater world outside of her
tiny Haworth village and its surrounding hills for a few
months.[fn:78] As I said above, hers was a world containing nothing
modern as we know it, e.g., a simple cut could lead to an infection
requiring amputation, or even worse.

Though it may seem counterintuitive to claim her existence in early
nineteen century West Yorkshire was as wild and rugged, as
back-to-nature as, say, homesteaders today on some remote Canadian
wilderness river. Was she still not observing nature from a
long-established civilised place of safety, thereby rendering her
observations just as tainted, just as removed and relativistic as ours
today? I say no. Clearly our modern, quasi-Earth astronaut perch of
high-tech materialism is many orders of magnitude greater than hers,
such that even our wildest, remotest places today are not nearly as
threatening, as precarious as was her own moolands. Just consider how
today each of us consumes upwards of /one hundred times/ the resources
and energy (i.e., per capita) as did one of our European ancestors
from Emily's time. As I contend, /the bigger the dance floor has
grown, the more spastic, the more abstract, the crazier the dancing
has become/. I see a direct correlation between resource
liberalisation and social liberalism---and thus the abstractions and
phantasms, the feeling of being lost in /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix][The Matrix]]/ we experience
today. I contend my Haworth Emily's was a unique vantage point in a
special place and time, neither too exposed to nor removed from
elemental nature. I contend pre-Roman Yorkshire and Brontëan Yorkshire
were more alike technologically, socially, look-and-feel than Brontëan
Yorkshire and today's Yorkshire just some two hundred years later.

And yet I'm often confronted with modern scoffers who must believe
Romantic Era poets only knew nature from picnics held at country
estates where dandies and their pampered ladies were attended by
servants, as seen, e.g., in Hollywood film versions of Jane
Austen[fn:79]

#+begin_export html
<img src="./images/EmmaPicnic2.png" width="770" alt="Emma picnic">
<span class="cap"><b>Emma</b> picnic in the harrowing, savage wilds of Surrey, England</span>
#+end_export

And of course, they pile up facts and figures about how deprived and
downtrodden the common man was back then. Against all this I will not
argue, so missing the point as they are. Again, for us moderns, nature is
a /place/, a /location/ away from and diametrically opposite our
modern space-station-like interior worlds. For us nature picks up
somewhere "outdoors," past our suburbs and out behind our agri-factory
farmlands, eventually becoming something we call the /Great
Outdoors/. And so the farther afield from modern civilization we can
go, the more authentic, the truer and wilder nature supposedly
becomes. And so we create a /nature continuum/ whereby a presumably
untouched, trackless wilderness as far from civilization as possible
is the truest nature, while hardly nature at all would be that weedy
ditch behind our triple-paned windowed, vinyl-siding-clad,
forced-air-HVAC suburban house. But let me again be blunt: We do not
get more nature simply because we have gone like exploring astronauts
ever farther out from our sterile, artificial exclusively human home
base. Nature is not something close or remote, rather, /Nature is
everywhere all the time/.

It is precisely because we have spoiled so much of our immediate
nature that we elevate far-afield wilderness regions to a practically
sacred, quasi-off-planet status. This is why writers like Ernest
Hemingway and Jack London exploit fright memes in describing distant,
exotic, hostile places like the Yukon and Africa ... indeed, virtually
identical to science fiction stories of strange, hostile, dangerous,
alien planets conquered by brave, intrepid astronauts. Now, where does
that get us?

And so I insist my poets of the so-called Romantic Era were not
pampered dandies with their fine ladies strolling for a few bored
minutes on manicured estate grounds, all while servants lived in
abject misery. Nor were they "white privilege" beneficiaries of the
"Age of Exploration" colonialism. My poets were mainly short-lived
little bats in their crevasses and corners, as hard-pressed as any
bats have ever been.

** Eighteenth-century British Dark

As alluded above, the world was seeing Dark, exploring dark
proclivities decades before Novalis and German Romanticism,
specifically eighteenth-century Britain and what might be called its
/gothic movement/ starting off with the doom-and-gloom /Graveyard
School/ of poetry. After Graveyard, just past mid-century, came the
/gothic novel/ full force with its direct, if not formulaic
doom-and-gloom. But then came what might be called the /Night School/,
which became the basis of my dark corner of Romanticism. Again, the
grave as inspiration---

*** The Graveyard School

It was only a few decades into the eighteenth century, many decades
before Wordsworth or Novalis, when there emerged in Britain a style of
poetry which has since been named the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_poets][Graveyard School]]/. As I do with
Novalis and his /HttN/, I can't help but believe these English
Graveyarders were more sleepwalkers than any sort of intentional
movement leaders. My Exhibit A of Graveyard is Edward Young's
epic-length /[[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33156/33156-h/33156-h.htm][The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts on Life, Death, &
Immortality]]/ (or simply /Night-Thoughts/, ca. 1742-1745).[fn:80]
Bursting with a grandiosity best provided by poetry, Young
relentlessly spins out darkness and doom. To be sure, he is Dark with
a shudder, full of fright memes meant to weigh down and ultimately
crush--if we take him seriously. A quick taste

#+begin_verse
"When the cock crew, he wept”---smote by that eye
Which looks on me, on all: that Power, who bids
This midnight sentinel, with clarion shrill
(Emblem of that which shall awake the dead),
Rouse souls from slumber, into thoughts of heaven.
Shall I too weep? Where then is fortitude?
And, fortitude abandon’d, where is man?
I know the terms on which he sees the light;
He that is born, is listed; life is war;
Eternal war with woe. Who bears it best,
Deserves it least...
#+end_verse

...indeed, life eternal war with unrelenting woe. Typical of Graveyard
School, there is no hope, no escape, just the weight of an assumed
curse (ultimately original sin?), then processions of lamentation to
cliff edges and the fated tumbling thereoff. Reading further

#+begin_verse
Art, brainless Art! our furious charioteer...
...Drives headlong towards the precipice of death;
Death, most our dread; death thus more dreadful made:
Oh, what a riddle of absurdity!
#+end_verse

Don't put away your hip-waders yet

#+begin_verse
From short (as usual) and disturb’d repose,
I wake: how happy they, who wake no more!
Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave.
I wake, emerging from a sea of dreams
Tumultuous; where my wreck’d desponding thought
From wave to wave of fancied misery
At random drove...
#+end_verse

I just hate it when dreams infest my grave, don't you? Of course every
student of the Dark Muse should read Young's /Night-thoughts/. But as
I say, this over-the-top doom hyperbole will eventually deliver even
the most indulgent reader to incredulity. Dare I say at some point it
becomes farce.[fn:81]

Though Graveyard had a more contemplative, measured side. For example,
Thomas Gray's /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44299/elegy-written-in-a-country-churchyard][Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]/ (1751) treats
our intellect with more respect. To be sure, eulogising the dead is a
much older and well established genre, typically emphasising the
qualities of the deceased over the dark, eternal abyss his grave might
represent. If we are meant to succumb to Young's relentless pounding,
Gray's elegy of a lost friend is Dark and fatalist and yet reverent
and faithful

#+begin_verse
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.
#+end_verse

With Gray whatever woefulness, doom may be swirling about, God in his
heavenly domain still has our backs. In short, Gray does not beat us
down as much as did the hardcore Graveyard Schoolers.

Whence this proto-Dark? Was there something Dark before? Or was it
simply in the air? As I insist about the Dark Muse in general,
Graveyard arrived unexpectedly, a natural, organic
upwelling---notwithstanding its heavy and oppressive. Which begs the
question, How does Dark rise to cultural and intellectual prominence
in an age?[fn:82] To be sure, many of that era condemned gothic and
Graveyard as unworthy subculture. But eventually came refinement,
which I might call the /Night School/. Though intervening was the
/gothic novel/, which we must now investigate.[fn:83]

*** Enter the /gothic novel/

Prose versus poetry. In the past, poetry was seen by members of polite
society as the higher, the acceptable form of literature. For example,
Germany has long been referred to as the land of /poets/ and
thinkers.[fn:84] Prose in the form of the novel,[fn:85] on the other
hand, was looked down on, seen as too revealing invasive personal,
i.e., it would be improper, unseemly, distasteful to expose even an
imaginary person's life details in such an open and revealing
fashion. And so according to this attitude, it was considered crude to
so freely fantasise human goings-on in a fictitious way. Preferable
for literature to ennoble the human as a being created in the likeness
of God, hence, let us not dwell on his mundanity and failings. After
all, a novel was neither factual (e.g. a saint's hagiography) nor high
lyrical poetic (e.g., church hymn lyrics or /Heldenlieder/). A
novel/roman was simply too plain-spoken, i.e., the unavoidable clarity
of straight descriptive writing invariably generated an undesirable
ordinariness. And so it was in this social climate that the prose
novel bumped along into post-Medieval Age as a tolerated, sometimes
useful corruption of writing, a regrettable parallel to poetry,
consumed mainly, as it was said, by arriviste vulgarian middle-class
women. But as the middle class grew in power and numbers, the
novel came to the fore, especially in the eighteenth century.[fn:86]

Modern academe considers the novel /The Castle of Otranto, A Gothic
Story/, appearing in its first edition in 1764, to be the official
start of British /gothic/ literature.[fn:87] Written by the excentric,
iconoclastic English nobleman Horace Walpole (1717 – 1797), /Otranto/
is a fantastical melodrama set in sixteenth-century Naples offering
the slumming, darkly-inclined readers of the day a big dose of
darkness, doom, and woe. Walpole's penchant for medievalism rode a
long-simmering nostalgic idealisation of the Medieval Age.[fn:88]
While the adjective /gothic/ referred to medieval Gothic architecture,
this is ironic since the label Gothic had previously been used
pejoratively in the Renaissance alluding to the destructive barbarian
nature of the Goths, that is to say, Gothic architecture was crude and
barbaric. Nonetheless, gothic "horror" was an instant hit, and other
writers and influencers quickly joined in creating a full-on gothic
literature movement.[fn:89]

<span class="cap">Wolf's Crag from Walter Scott's gothic <i>The Bride of Lammermore</i> </span>
#+end_export

Above is an etching from a publication of Sir Walter Scott's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_of_Lammermoor][The
Bride of Lammermore]]/ (1819). Consider the sheer visual density and
heaviness of the scene (click on the image to be taken to a larger
version). /Whence, wherefore/ this heaviness, this portent?
Predominant is Nature being Dark in an inhospitable, threatening
way. The human-built castle is primitive, isolated, and
vulnerable. The riders are miniscule, exposed... It's as if every
single living cell---plant, animal, human---is clinging to life by a
thread, and any dim green and blue hues of vegetation and sea are
wholly irrelevant. The scene evokes danger, dysphoria, as if surely
something horrific is just waiting to transpire. But again how, why?
Why did such darkness emerge and what was (and still is) the appeal?
Hitchcock tautologies aside,[fn:90] modern academe has offered
theories about the socio-political-psychological landscape of the
times, and yet these experts only sound supercilious and patronising
from their modern triumphalist perches, as if they are searching for a
disease to explain a malady, weakness to explain indulgence. No,
indeed, Dark, even when crude and heavy, arrests, mystifies,
predominates, the appeal all the stronger for its recessive,
ungraspable spherical symmetry. To be sure, this "coming out" of
gothic in the eighteenth century was overwrought, indulgent with its
fright memes, but undeniably popular and onto something real about the
inner human experience---at least to the Western world of those times.

The popularity of the gothic novel continued throughout the nineteenth
and into the twentieth century primarily in the romance genre---after
the term romance had evolved to mean love.[fn:91] Among others,
Frances Parkinson Keyes (1885 – 1970) was a popular romance author who
often wrote from a gothic perspective. /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonwyck_(film)][Dragonwyck]]/ (1946) is a prime
example of Hollywood[fn:92] does heavy, doomy, gothic romance.

**** Received gothic

Novelist Ann Radcliffe (1764 - 1823) could be said to be the first to
gain respectability for gothic fiction. Upper-middle-class and
spanning the proto-Romantic late-eighteenth century into the Romantic
Era, she forged a broad readership in the risen middle class for her
moral and otherwise high-brow treatment of gothic
gloom-and-doom. Again, a certain shade of Dark beyond cheap fright
devices was evolving and Radcliffe was a part of it.

The three most popular novels written by the Brontë sisters---/Jane
Eyre/ by Charlotte, /Wuthering Heights/ by Emily, and /The Tenant of
Wildfell Hall/ by Anne---are usually considered to be gothic, and
therefore, at least according to my logic, flawed vis-à-vis Dark. But
like I saying, by the time of their publication and subsequent fame,
gothic prose had largely shaken off its lightweight and déclassé
image. Class and taste were no longer the problem, rather, expression
and depiction. But as I insist, prose attempting Dark cannot help but
miss the subtleties and power of poetry.[fn:93]

*** The night, the stars, the moon...and I was darkling left...

As unique and original as I want Novalis' /Hymns to the Night/ to
have been, I must present Englishwoman Anna Lætitia Barbauld's /[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_(Barbauld)/A_Summer_Evening%27s_Meditation][A
Summer Evening's Meditation]]/ (/ASEM/) as the same sort of solemn
praising of the Night, but having already appeared in 1773.

Without more investigation I have no real idea if Barbauld's /ASEM/,
weighing in at one hundred and twenty-four lines, started what I'm
calling the /Night School/, but as a working theory, yes, she offered
eighteenth-century Britain a new perspective on Dark with an
accessibility and maturity not really seen in Graveyard and certainly
not gothic novels. She nods to Young's /Night-thoughts/ at the start
with the quote, /One sun by day, by night ten thousand shine/, then
launches directly into her summer night and its canopy of stars

#+begin_verse
Tis past! The sultry tyrant of the south
Has spent his short-liv'd rage; more grateful hours
Move silent on; the skies no more repel
The dazzled sight, but with mild maiden beams
Of temper'd light, invite the cherish'd eye
To wander o'er their sphere; where hung aloft
Dian's bright crescent, like a silver bow
New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns
Impatient for the night, and seems to push
Her brother down the sky. Fair Venus shines
E'en in the eye of day; with sweetest beam
Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood
Of soften'd radiance from her dewy locks.
The shadows spread apace; while meeken'd Eve
Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires
Thro' the Hesperian gardens of the west,
And shuts the gates of day. 'Tis now the hour
When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,
#+end_verse

No woe, no doom-and-gloom; instead, a relentless parade of visceral
and natural Dark hyperconductivity. Barbauld hauls us outdoors to
partake, imbibe, behold the Night like never before. We are not
swimming in doom, rather, we are touched, moved to reflect on darkness
with reverence...

#+begin_verse
...But are they silent all? or is there not
A tongue in every star that talks with man,
And wooes him to be wife; nor wooes in vain:
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.
At this still hour the self-collected soul
Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there
Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;
An embryo God; a spark of fire divine,
Which must burn on for ages, when the sun,
(Fair transitory creature of a day!)
Has clos'd his golden eye, and wrap'd in shades
Forgets his wonted journey thro' the east.
#+end_verse

Night over day. Night expansive yet serene and passive, a more nuanced
interim inviting deeper, more mature and human introspection. Far
distant, cool, and gentle are the myriad stars of a summer's eve,
unlike our single oversized and often ruinous local star of day. And
here is some of my own doggerel called /From a Grandniece To Her
Great-aunt At Her Great-uncle’s Funeral/

#+begin_verse
You see, dear Auntie, 
Day is all supposes, 
Night but only a few.
Night quietly closes 
Day’s great to-do.
Lost on the Day,
I wait for deepest Night,
for Darkness and I must
Decline clamant Light. 
#+end_verse
  
This is my kind of Dark, i.e., free of any campy scare tactics---fun
as they may be. Most assuredly every protégé of the Dark Muse, all
darkly inspired must read Barbauld's masterpiece. Hers is an
exposition of natural darkness, placing it far above the reproach of
gothic horror detractors. Though /ASEM/ was as far as I can tell a
singleton, a unicorn whose influence seemed to lay dormant for
decades.[fn:94] One Barbauld biographer mentioned a trend of that time
of ladies studying astronomy. But obviously Barbauld is waxing Dark,
not just dabbling with celestial bodies. Perusing her other poems,
yes, she often dwells on nature, sometimes in a dusky way, but
addressing Dark as she did with /ASEM/ doesn't appear again, nor from
others during her pre-Romanticism times. Today she is known as an
influential social commentator, moralist, and educator, but not as
proto-Romanticism. And so I must jump ahead some /fifty/ years and
bring in Brontëan poetry as a direct continuation of this Night School
thread. Haworth Emily's /[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Poems_of_Emily_Bront%C3%AB/Stars][Stars]]/ is just one her many examples of Night
School from someone who probably had never read nor heard of
Barbauld's /ASEM/. Exactly like Barbauld, in /Stars/ Haworth Emily
lauds the night and its starry sky

#+begin_verse
Thought followed thought, star followed star
Through boundless regions, on;
While one sweet influence, near and far,
Thrilled through, and proved us one!

Why did the morning dawn to break
So great, so pure, a spell;
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,
Where your cool radiance fell?
#+end_verse

The untrammelled night sky's depth and expanse over the harsh blaring,
the tedium of daylight life, indeed. And so the last two stanzas

#+begin_verse
Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night;
Oh, night and stars, return!
And hide me from the hostile light
That does not warm, but burn;

That drains the blood of suffering men;
Drinks tears, instead of dew;
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,
And only wake with you!
#+end_verse

Night School redeems Dark by pulling it out of the ostentatiousness,
the gimmickry of Graveyard and gothic. Probably started by Barbauld
(until I may find evidence to the contrary), it was independently
embraced by others. Let's look at sister Anne Brontë's /Night/

#+begin_verse
I love the silent hour of night,
For blissful dreams may then arise,
Revealing to my charmed sight
What may not bless my waking eyes.

And then a voice may meet my ear,
That death has silenced long ago;
And hope and rapture may appear
Instead of solitude and woe.

Cold in the grave for years has lain
The form it was my bliss to see;
And only dreams can bring again,
The darling of my heart to me.
#+end_verse

Simpler, more measured was Anne's poetry than her sister's. And she
includes the grave by eulogising either of her older sisters Maria or
Elizabeth, or her mother, but again, sans drama. And this calmer, more
introspective Dark kept quietly maturing throughout the nineteenth
century.

But let us not forget the many poems devoted to the moon. Here is Anne
Brontë's /Fluctuations/

#+begin_verse
What though the Sun had left my sky;
To save me from despair
The blessed Moon arose on high,
And shone serenely there.

I watched her, with a tearful gaze,
Rise slowly o'er the hill,
While through the dim horizon's haze
Her light gleamed faint and chill.

I thought such wan and lifeless beams
Could ne'er my heart repay
For the bright sun's most transient gleams
That cheered me through the day:

But, as above that mist's control
She rose, and brighter shone,
I felt her light upon my soul;
But now---that light is gone!

Thick vapours snatched her from my sight,
And I was darkling left,
All in the cold and gloomy night,
Of light and hope bereft:

Until, methought, a little star
Shone forth with trembling ray,
To cheer me with its light afar---
But that, too, passed away.

Anon, an earthly meteor blazed
The gloomy darkness through;
I smiled, yet trembled while I gazed---
But that soon vanished too!

And darker, drearier fell the night
Upon my spirit then;---
But what is that faint struggling light?
Is it the Moon again?

Kind Heaven! increase that silvery gleam
And bid these clouds depart,
And let her soft celestial beam
Restore my fainting heart!
#+end_verse

Here we may imagine the youngest Brontë bowed if not weighed down by
her earthly afflictions, cares, deprivations; but then in this lean,
hungry, susceptible state she is caught in an emotional whirling,
carried, borne up by the natural nighttime procession of sun to moon
and stars. She speaks of her tearful gaze, her fainting heart, her
spirits, her emotional exposure. She is a vulnerable ward of nature,
but all the more tenaciously pursuant of its subtleties. Indeed, back
then it was always subtleties, delicate qualities found in Nature by
the vulnerable if not pathetic human, an exacting counting of
seemingly modest blessings which then gained them a sublime
ascendency. Oh, what we miss today...

If I weren't pledged to Emily, I might say Anne has an even finer take
on Dark than her older sister. I might dare to say Anne's Christianity
is more conventional, whereas Emily with her obvious
thought-behind-thoughts mental state wound up taking a starker, more
fatalist view of God. Anne humble, Emily defiant perhaps;
nevertheless, the Dark Muse absolutely owned by the B-Sisters!

William Wordsworth was nearly always about daylit Nature, as were his
foundational Romanticist ideals. Though in his /A Night Thought/
(published 1837) he clearly intersects with Night School

#+begin_verse
Lo! where the Moon along the sky
Sails with her happy destiny;
Oft is she hid from mortal eye
Or dimly seen,
But when the clouds asunder fly
How bright her mien!

Far different we---a froward race,
Thousands though rich in Fortune's grace
With cherished sullenness of pace
Their way pursue,
Ingrates who wear a smileless face
The whole year through.

If kindred humours e'er would make
My spirit droop for drooping's sake,
From Fancy following in thy wake,
Bright ship of heaven!
A counter impulse let me take
And be forgiven.
#+end_verse

Moon and Night would simply be another aspect of didactic Nature,
though he does allude to the more mature subtlety brought by the
darkness. Again, he has wandered into Night School in his /To the
Moon/, here the second stanza

#+begin_verse
The aspiring Mountains and the winding Streams,
Empress of Night! are gladdened by thy beams;
A look of thine the wilderness pervades,
And penetrates the forest's inmost shades;
Thou, chequering peaceably the minster's gloom,
Guid'st the pale Mourner to the lost one's tomb;
Canst reach the Prisoner---to his grated cell
Welcome, though silent and intangible!---
And lives there one, of all that come and go
On the great waters toiling to and fro,
One, who has watched thee at some quiet hour
Enthroned aloft in undisputed power,
Or crossed by vapoury streaks and clouds that move
Catching the lustre they in part reprove---
Nor sometimes felt a fitness in thy sway
To call up thoughts that shun the glare of day,
And make the serious happier than the gay?
#+end_verse

If I previously alluded Wordsworth concentrated on Nature over Dark,
with these choice few lines he does Dark Muse very well, indeed. Sad
then that he didn't have more to say about Dark.

Allow me to mention another Night Schooler, namely, the Swiss poet
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Keller][Gottfried Keller]]. Again, he is even later by some three or four
decades than the Brontës or Wordsworth. Here is his /Winternacht/ or
/Winter Night/

#+begin_verse
Not a wingbeat went through the world;
silent and brilliant lay the white snow.
Not a puff of cloud hung in the starry canopy,
no wave surged in the torpid lake.
 
From the depths climbed a lake-tree,
to its crown encased in ice;
and upon its branches climbed the water nymph,
gazing up through the green ice.
 
There I stood upon the thin glass
that separated me from the black depths;
Close beneath my feet I saw
her white beauty, limb for limb.
 
With smothered sorrow she groped
here and there on the hard barrier.
Never will I will forget her dark expression;
always, always, shall it remain in my mind!
#+end_verse

One of my favourites, I have always wondered what the protagonist did
with the rest of his life. Did he return to the lake to try and find
his water nymph; or did he resign himself to his mortal and mundane
life? Indeed, the human divorced from Nature, though having a reunion
of sorts one night. In any event, the mystery and allure, the
aesthetic of a forest in deep winter night is undeniable.[fn:95] Such
magic and mystery obviously could not have occurred in daylight. Like
Edgar Allan Poe's /The Raven/, which we will discuss below, there is a
melancholy over a loss that deepens and ultimately enriches.

And so with Night School first there is Nature dark, then human
reflection upon that natural Dark. To be sure, recitations of the
world in darkness give subtle rise to the finest, keenest insights and
feelings. /...to call up thoughts that shun the glare of day/, indeed.

** Romanticism (sic)

If a group of people enter a restaurant together, the maître d' will
probably assume they are a party and require a single table. This is a
good analogy to what has happened to my Dark principals over the
years. I certainly have a lot to say about what has come to be known
as /Romanticism/,[fn:96] as it is the catch-all term meant to make my
principals sit at the same table and seem good company.

By now the reader knows I want my principals to have come by their
sublime poetry "as naturally as leaves come to a tree," as the film
/Bright Star/'s Keats said. I insist my visionaries were just that,
timeless and visionary. Yes, they might have had much in common,
obviously a time line, but I cannot abide reducing them to puppets
dangling on strings connected, owing to proto-this or precursor-that
on some academe's assembly line.[fn:97] Of course my principals were
of their times, and yet outliers, outsiders, unicorns, not for lumping
together or lining up on a labelled shelf. Worse, I also insist their
actual lives give little solid insight into their gifts. And yet we
have this most /unnatural/ box, this clammy container created by both
contemporaries of the day, then subsequent generations of experts to
hold, control, own, to /jail/ my greats, this cage they call
/Romanticism/. And so I say again, gripping butterflies squashes them.

Imagining influences is bread-and-butter Romantic Era academics. One
hot mess is the [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0144q90/episodes/guide][BBC's series on Romanticism]][fn:98] hosted by English
historian Peter Ackroyd. And then severe, left-brained Bertrand
Russell in his /The History of Western Philosophy/ mangles away at
Romanticism in his consummate pedantic way. These are Exhibit A-1 and
A-2 of people who don't get it but must sound important erudite.

*** Feelings, emotions, innocence, nature ... anything else?

So many proofs of these "Abstract Topological Romanticism" slogs begin
with this set of axiomatic equations[fn:99]

\begin{align*}
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{feelings}}, \\
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{emotions}}, \\
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{innocence}}, \\
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{nature}}
\end{align*}

for to build theorems whereby Romanticism is proven a spirited,
anti-rationalist (unrational, disrational, irrational?), predominantly
vernal youthful /revolt/ against the soulless straitjacket, the
supposedly failed humanism of Enlightenment logic, as well as stodgy,
urban-centric classicism ... basically, anything established and
coming before. Like hallucinating AI chatbots, academe spins and
tangles cords and wires, connecting up Descartes, Rousseau, the
American and French Revolutions, Defoe, Spinoza, Bacon, Hobbs,
Shakespeare,[fn:100] ... Buddha, Jesus, Merlin, the Pope, etc., to form
massive graphs of vertices and edges spanning the near and distant
past---the denser, the more far-fetched the better. And yet this
microscopic literary DNA matching is mostly happening long after the
fact in a modern setting, separate, aloof, and ultimately terminally
clueless. So often my beloved visionary principals are
anachronistically tagged proto-Beat, archetypal-hippie,
back-to-nature, right-brain contrarian iconoclasts just doing their
anti-Establishment thing.[fn:101]

There is the famous Oxford professor Isaiah Berlin[fn:102] who
described Romanticism in an oft-sited set of lectures as

+ a new and restless spirit, seeking /violently/ to burst through old
  and cramping forms,[fn:103]
+ a /nervous/ preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of
  consciousness,
+ a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual
  movement and change,
+ an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life,
+ a /passionate/ effort at self-assertion both individual and
  collective,
+ a search after means of expressing an /unappeasable yearning for
  unattainable goals/.

Especially the last point makes my principals seem like children who
want everything in life's candy shop. Again, an intentionality is
implied that my principals most certainly did not bring---leading us
once more to the disjunction between latter-day "expert" analysts and
the original, now grave-mute creators. But then the question Berlin
raised at the beginning of his first lecture, namely, whether this was
really a movement at all---or just a state of mind always "in the
air," emerging but then fading, as I might add, like virtual quantum
particles blinking in and out of existence...

Similarly, Berlin cannot nail down what supposed adherents to
Romanticism really wanted or were about. He imagines interviewing
Romanticism proponents of the times

#+begin_quote
Suppose you had spoken to these persons. You would have found that
their ideal of life was approximately of the following kind
... integrity, sincerity, readiness to sacrifice one's life to some
inner light, dedication to some ideal for which it is worth
sacrificing all that one is, for which it is worth both living and
dying. You would have found that they were not primarily interested in
knowledge, or in the advance of science, not interested in political
power, not interested in happiness, not interested, above all, in
adjustment to life, in finding your place in society, in living at
peace with your government, even in loyalty to your king or to your
republic. You would have found that common sense, moderation, was very
far from their thoughts.
#+end_quote

In my humble opinion, this describes nothing. Granted, Berlin seems to
cotton on to how very cryptic and fluid it all was back then. But
again, he is describing just a proponent, a person in the stands with
his "these persons"---and missing what really made my principals so
great. He just doesn't get it. He mistakes the chance geometry on the
forest floor for a path that really was never there.

As a writer myself I can say writing is difficult. I once sat down and
tried to write something prose without any prior ideas, themes, or
prompts. I simply asked myself over and over "What are you trying to
say?" And out came a wild story of a Byronic hero, probably a ghost,
pacing up and down a past-century street in eternal twilight being
reclaimed by encroaching Nature. Right. I can say yes to Berlin's
not-interesteds above, but then I stand as he does before the question
of /What are we trying to do?/ In my case a dark, gothic novella
popped out of all the confusion and blockage---and this long before I
had turned my attention to Dark. Such a lack of definite is quite
obvious in my principals as well.

For example, much is made by latter-day experts of the "writing
contest" held by Byron, the Shelleys, Mary and Percy, and John
Polidori in the summer of 1816. Indeed, there could be nothing more
Dark than an unnaturally (volcanic eruption-induced) cold, wet, and
dark summer in a villa on Lake Geneva. If you have ever been around
intelligent, creative people who are throwing around ideas, you'll
know how wild and unpredictable it can be. Out of that summer's
endeavour came /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein][Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus]]/ written by
Mary Shelley,[fn:104] /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vampyre][The Vampyre; A Tale]]/ written by John Polidori,
and Byron's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness_(poem)][Darkness]]/. But again, this is the literary version of
quantum virtual particles coming into existence out of nowhere, with
no real rhyme or reason to rearrange some two centuries later into
dissertations. And though Dark was the centreing concept, all three
works are really just throwbacks to gothic horror. In my estimation,
they did not move the Dark needle into the red zone.

Again, the question: Where is Dark in any of academe's Romanticism?
And no, I don't mean campy pop gothic. The feelings, the emotions, and
above all, the vision Haworth Emily describes in /Fall leaves fall/

#+begin_verse
...I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse

simply do not appear in any academic treatment of Romanticism, forcing
me through this manifesto to start over from scratch. Again, /Emily is
not just Novalis' poetising./ When I read her /Fall leaves fall/, yes,
they are words to be processed by my brain's logical language model,
but then they land on the emotional limbic part of my mind. This is a
quasi-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron][mirror neuron]] "yes, I feel this way too" moment giving me pause
and transporting me once again to the gates of the Dark Muse. /Fall
leaves fall/ is its own alpha and omega, i.e., I imbibe, feel, and go
forth. I /behold/ all this sublime ideation of darkness and allow it
to move me. And it surely does. But then that is all. /There is no
further work for the logical frontal cortex, let alone scholarship./
Haworth Emily infects me with contagion, and I too smile and sing
along with her for the Dark Muse.

Surely we all try to follow logically-set plans, rules in our lives,
logically-derived "goals." But we are simultaneously emotional beings,
constantly assessing how we /feel/ about this or that, how we /feel/
overall. This is what I call the /logic train/ and the /emotion
braid/. And so when I read /Fall leaves fall/ my braid of emotions
stretching back to my birth (or even further) swells and lifts me
beyond my mundane, deterministic logic train. /And it is exactly this
mirroring and swelling that scholars don't get, never catch on to./
Visions of snowy wreathes and night's decay have me pause on my clear,
well-lit logic track.

How do we maintain emotional health? By minding our feelings. And so I
will share a bit of my folk psychology: We cannot allow the logical to
always dominate and control the emotional. There can be no stripping out
of some strand of our emotion braiding. And so when dealing with
academe's cutting around on Romanticism I must, as Amherst Emily said,
/Beware of the surgeon with his knife, lest he find the culprit life/.

*** Nature reduced to sappy sentimentality

The indoorsmen of academe never fail to raise /nature/ up as a
hallmark of Romanticism. It's nature, nature, nature---but with only
the most patronising view of what it meant to my principals. Nature
what? Nature awareness, appreciation, adulation, respect,
idealisation, idolisation, rapture, fervour, worship. And so Nature
becomes just a metaphor supply closet,[fn:105] a source of inspiration,
a cruel mistress, a loving mother---an hallucinogenic drug... So
separated from Nature as academe is, Nature gets batted around
endlessly, again, making my principals seem soppy, dreamy,
sentimental, their lines see-through by us greater, wiser modernist
grownups. Again, academe does not, cannot understand Nature as I've
described it above, i.e., a non-place; instead, the constant
everything everywhere cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
Death.

Academe's favourite Romanticism nature boy is of course William
Wordsworth, whom so many call Romanticism's godfather[fn:106]---but
then routinely pan as a sappy sentimentalist. Scholars are creatures
of their times too, beholden unto the modern age and its shallow
urban-bound nihilist-tainted public. Thus, they cannot help but use as
touchstones modern realism and our supposedly more objective and
unvarnished realist understanding of nature. Whatever Wordsworth said
about wandering like a cloud and going nuts over daffodils is
presented to classrooms as affected, mushy, maudlin

#+begin_verse
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed---but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.

Eye rolls, smirks, and tsk-tsking in today's English department
classrooms. The fonder Wordsworth's waxing, the more he is the target of
our patronisation and condemnation. Missed entirely is his subtle and
sublime. Here from /Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey/

#+begin_verse
...Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,
In which the burthen of the mystery,
In which the heavy and the weary weight
Of all this unintelligible world,
Is lightened:---that serene and blessed mood,
In which the affections gently lead us on,---
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame
And even the motion of our human blood
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep
In body, and become a living soul:
While with an eye made quiet by the power
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,
We see into the life of things.
#+end_verse

Modernism has no concept of, no use for affections, for serene and
blessed moods, of seeing into the true life of things. Of course
Wordsworth is genial here. He goes to the heart and soul of what I
want to bring forth with WutheringUK, even though he hasn't included
Dark. With words he causes great vibrations to my emotion braid by
/yearning for true membership to the greater realm of Nature/---as I
would. He's a thankful man, which is so foreign to the ego-,
anthropocentric modernist triumphalist today. We, however, supposedly
better informed by modern science, distance ourselves from any sort
environmental equality. And so a false pseudo-objectivity comes home
to roost. A scholar in the Wikipedia article on /Tintern Abbey/
complains of Wordsworth ignoring the reality of the times

#+begin_quote
[Wordsworth manages] to see into the life of things only by narrowing
and skewing his field of vision and by excluding certain conflictual
sights and meanings.
#+end_quote

Obviously, Wordsworth was a toxic male apologist for the
hetero-patriarchal capitalist industrialist imperialist system,
conveniently ignoring how so very many women and minorities were being
oppressed exactly as he, so privileged, gazed so narrowly upon those
sights and penned those lines... And so Wordsworth winds up just a
dusty old statue glimpsed during a quick run-through the classic wing
of the museum, much more interesting, much better things in the modern
wing for sure. Alas...

Most condemned, Wordsworth tried to make nature the main house for
human purity and innocence. In /To a Highland Girl/ he transforms a
peasant shepherdess he encountered on a trip to Scotland into a
demi-angel

#+begin_verse
...With earnest feeling I shall pray
For thee when I am far away:
For never saw I mien, or face,
In which more plainly I could trace
Benignity and home-bred sense
Ripening in perfect innocence.
#+end_verse

I guess you had to have been there...

And so nature for modern academe is never more than a /theme/, a
/leitmotif/, thus, a piece of the very oxymoron-ish "creative
machinery"---bereft of any clue as to what Nature as I capitalise it
means.[fn:107] Indeed, Nature conducive to feelings and innocence,
inviting re-sensitisation ... Romanticism poetry so often nothing more
than someone describing what they /see/ and how it makes them /feel/
and /yearn/ ... but then modern realism, now mired in nihilism and
outright absurdism, not able to abide any of this and actively trying
to denigrate it. The modernist harps on /reality/ as if only we today
know it, certainly not the creative souls of over two centuries
past. How dare anyone raise up sentimentality let alone sublimity in
the midsts of hardships only we moderns have properly addressed, e.g.,
a sexually-oppressed working-class shepherdess who undoubtedly had to
wash her homespun clothing by hand with lye soap. The modernist's
favourite word is "conditions," as in "conditions were deplorable"
meant to cancel any nature gushing by privileged elitist poets. And so
the ghosts of an "oppressive system" are always trotted out to cast
shade on my principals---despite how vulnerable everyone of that age
was. I hope with WutheringUK to give you a better understanding of who
and what my principals were.

As I just said, so often my principals simply listed out with reverent
poetising their observations of nature, as does Anne Brontë in her
/Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day/

#+begin_verse
My soul is awakened, my spirit is soaring
And carried aloft on the wings of the breeze;
For above and around me the wild wind is roaring,
Arousing to rapture the earth and the seas.

The long withered grass in the sunshine is glancing,
The bare trees are tossing their branches on high;
The dead leaves beneath them are merrily dancing,
The white clouds are scudding across the blue sky

I wish I could see how the ocean is lashing
The foam of its billows to whirlwinds of spray;
I wish I could see how its proud waves are dashing,
And hear the wild roar of their thunder to-day!
#+end_verse

I see my principals instinctively, unintentionally, belatedly stamping
a new European nature worship out of their nearby moors and
forests---necessarily independent of whatever had been the vernacular
paganisms before Roman occupation ... orthogonal as well to
Elizabethan pastoral lyric, German /Shepherd Poetry/ of the
post-Thirty Years War seventeenth century, or even the Greek Arcadian
/Bucolic/ traditions, and, of course fully unaware of any of our New
Age Eastern-slash-shamanism mashups.[fn:108] They found something
entirely new and, dare I say, as authentic as possible. Again, Nature
capitalised. Then the urge to explore how nuanced Nature was. Here is
a more sober quote from Haworth Emily

#+begin_quote
All creation is equally mad. Nature is an inexplicable problem; it
exists on a principle of destruction. Every being must be the tireless
instrument of death to others, or itself must cease to live. Yet
nonetheless we celebrate the day of our birth, and we praise God for
having entered such a world.
#+end_quote

In my opinion, this says it all---and in such simple terms. Later I
will dive into the three poems which I believe describe this seemingly
simple but portentously paradoxical observation best. But I must
emphasise, /her Nature is completely different from our modern
scientific and locational ideas thereof/.

*** Sensitivity

Besides Nature, the modern ivory tower wants my principals, as for
example Berlin argues, to have been more in tune with their senses,
more impulsive, less emotionally suppressed---out to downright
sensual.[fn:109] And so when not signalling political correctness,
modern scholars simply patronise, like developmental psychologists
describing children. I am constantly confronted with how modernists so
widely miss what being instinctual and creative was back in the
so-called Romantic Era. Regrettable this, how one sort of gifted---the
analytical intellectual scholar---is unable to fathom another sort of
gifted---the artistic lyrical.

And yet from an historical, socio-psychological standpoint we today
may only guess (badly?) at what creative, sensitive people in those
times saw, thought, felt. Insensitive to the suffering of the
oppressed classes? What did the escalating Industrial Revolution, as
well as British imperialism mean to people at the dawn of the
nineteenth century? I posit these external forces were the source of
dehumanising and ultimately /desensitising/ reverberations throughout
society, felt keenest by my brightest, most sensitive
people. Politically correct as we might be, we today are at quite
different levels of accommodating the awful, at normalising,
relativising, turning on numbness to the consequences of modern
industrial life. But as the eighteenth century was ending, moral and
emotional disassociation was not so advanced, reactions more
spontaneous and honest. And to be sure, my principals were affronted
by what humanity was doing, troubled especially over where it was all
heading.

No, my principals did not personally experience human exploitation,
colonialism, capitalist industrialism, and yet they either knew of it
or sensed its impact. And in their own fashion they became
crypto-reactionary against it. What was conscious versus what
subconscious in Wordsworth's mind as he sat above the Tintern Abbey
ruins? Indeed, all of the negativity supposedly swirling around---the
burgeoning British Empire, the immediate proto-indstrialism havoc all
around the River Wye and environs. And yet his response was limbic
pondering. Of course modern academe will churn out filler---the
historicity, the paradigms, and socio-political winds. They make the
backdrop of Enlightenment's cold, relentless dynamism and reductionist
determinism visible in contrast. But this all misses the visceral, the
emotional aspect. And so I say, /It takes a poet to know a poet, and
it takes a special, time-travelling poet to know these special
Romantic Era poets./

But then dare I, your guide, claiming poetic skill, be so critical of
all these well-established Romantic Era professors? Following is
something I wrote in the spirit

#+begin_verse
And from bygone generations I have surely more than blood.
The loom, the wrapped bolt a shared past, holds me taunt.
And try though I may, little hope there is finding out,
Fully realising this force of past souls and blood.
For no sooner is some design of
Art, music, words offered than opens
A far greater twilit space echoing the past.
Alas, that these modern conceits must us all fail;
For the Muses range far above, behind, and beyond--- 
From the heart out to the eternal sea, sky, land,
And everywhere and forever between,
Subtle to mystical to rapturous.

Woe, the tarried songbird whose weakening wings
In late November portend death’s evening hour,
Life’s requisite warmth finally dissipated,
Her once vast blue space closing dark,
The mysterious frontiers setting up,
The shadowy boundary closing...

That we humans may touch,
Stroke the dark velvet curtains
Long before we slip the concealed gaps.
Death would have all such anticipation moot---
All suppositions. vain assurances flashing then quit,
All expectations rattling, echoing lastly towards stillness
Leaving friends to carry on in dutiful remembrance,
That those, at graveside, must as best they can
Face the darkness and resolutely reach out
Beyond the day’s anguish and sadness
(Vainly?) to some holy everlasting.
#+end_verse

This might have won me an honourable mention back in the day, perhaps
a dinner invite. But I seriously doubt any contemporary Romanticism
experts could have written such lines---half because they could not,
half because to such mawkishness they would not deign.

Yes, my poets of yore. And as Berlin noted, no political stance was
ever intended; rather, by trying to re-humanise, /re-sensitise/, à la
Novalis' poetising, theirs would be a far more subversive phenomenon
as only some new belief system or "underground movement" can
be. Socio-political templates of today do not let through my
principals, rather, they cover them up. But if Emily Dickinson, for
example, meant nothing political or even religious, no consciously
declared lifestyle or paradigm, what did she mean, what did any of
them mean or want? To me what they did and said seem in my times
wholly ethereal and extra-human. One historicity modernists cannot
abide is how my principals drafted behind the general severe Calvinist
Christian wake of the time, ultimately deferring to God. Here is Emily
Dickinson poetising belief

One fallout due to the Wordsworths' and Coleridge's "regionalism" was
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_District][Lake District]] becoming the modern world’s first eco-literature
tourist destination, now a national park with sixteen million visitors
a year.[fn:110] Again, we find none of Hemingway's adventure and
danger in Wordsworth's /Home at Grasmere/[fn:111]

#+begin_verse
...
The place from which I looked was soft and green,
Not giddy yet aerial, with a depth
Of Vale below, a height of Hills above.
Long did I halt; I could have made it even
My business and my errand so to halt.
For rest of body ’twas a perfect place,
All that luxurious nature could desire,
But tempting to the Spirit; who could look
And not feel motions there? I thought of clouds
That sail on winds; of breezes that delight
To play on water, or in endless chase
Pursue each other through the liquid depths
Of grass or corn, over and through and through,
In billow after billow, evermore;
Of Sunbeams, Shadows, Butterflies and Birds,
Angels and winged Creatures that are Lords
Without restraint of all which they behold.
...

And so he is more what might today in slight be call /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottagecore][Cottagecore]]/
than, e.g., Jack London's cast of wolves ripping throats in his
relentlessly savage, slant-anthropomorphic /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Fang][White Fang]]/. So many of
the tourists to Tintern Abbey or the Lake District expect to /feel/
something of what Wordsworth felt, extra-experiential to the unique
scenery itself. /They want to be moved like he was moved./ Contrast
this with visitors to Alaska wanting a Jack London take on the wilds
they experience for a few days.

*** East and West: Why my Dark Muse cannot abide the East

As a teen in the early 1970s, I, like so many around me, fell under
the spell of the strange and mysterious television series /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_(1972_TV_series)][Kung Fu]]/,
which premiered in 1972. For a kid growing up in Tennessee, /Kung Fu/
was a Western pop introduction to Eastern religion and philosophy. The
main character, Kwai Chang Caine, is a Chinese-American orphan raised
in a Chinese Shaolin Buddhist monastery circa mid-1800s. /Kung Fu/
begins with Caine as a young man revenge killing a nobleman who has
senselessly killed his beloved master. Which of course is the
antithesis of the Buddhist way; hence, Caine must leave the monastery,
and China as well, heading to America. Before this crisis, orphan
Caine was taught the Kung Fu martial arts style alongside the Buddhist
pacifist, non-resistant approach to life. And so episode after episode
Kwai Chang roams across the American Wild West of the mid-nineteenth
century as an aesthete itinerant on the run from the Chinese
government, embodying the peaceful, compassionate way---all while
putting bad guys on there butts.

Wanting to know more, I found a book on Zen Buddhism where I found the
concept of /Unsui/, which is Japanese and means /cloud, water/. The
term also refers to a novice monk

#+begin_quote
In Japan, one receives unsui ordination at the beginning of formal
ordained practice, and this is often perceived as 'novice ordination.'
#+end_quote

This dense, written-for-adults book further described unsui
metaphorically, saying water exhibits perfect /passive resistance/,
e.g., it changes states if challenged: as water it flows around
impediments; as steam it evaporates away from heat; if blocked or
dammed, it simply waits supremely patient; if frozen, likewise,
waits---for nothing can stop its eventual movement to the sea. And yet
now I see this as irrelevant to my Dark Muse, a false path, so to
speak. I remember we were all enthralled with Kwai Chang's adventures;
kids and adults alike all looked forward to each new episode. But yes,
looking back I can now say with assurance this extreme Eastern
pacifism is not for me.

Buddhism wants enlightenment---which supposedly raises us to a higher
trans-human state. For example, once enlightened we no longer can be
dragged down by worldly cares, needs, desires, hassles. But how many
actually reach this state, a place like some quasi-permanent version
of Dostoyevski's presence of eternal harmony? This is why I cannot
take seriously any sort of Eastern religion with the stated goal of
enlightenment, if for no other reason than /so very few people ever
arrive at this self-actualization/. And where is my Dark in the East?
Say what you will about it, the "severist," Calvinist-flavoured
Christianity of the Brontë sisters is probably the "house
spirituality" of my Dark Muse.

But can there be a Western Zen? To be sure, Emily Brontë's /All
creation is equally mad.../ presents a deep koan-like paradox. Which
would seem to fall into fatalism or perhaps stoicism rather than
offering any guarantees to higher consciousness. /Buddhism promises
relief from suffering. My Dark, however, "works with suffering."/

My principals never sought to offer anything as spiritually
comprehensive as Buddhism, no sort of spiritual path to higher
anything. They held seeds, not finished canned goods. They expanded on
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturm_und_Drang][Sturm und Drang]]/, but did not draw out any sort of architectural
plans. Yes, interaction with, movement in Nature; but no political or
spiritual paradigms towards specified goals for the mundane
world. They lived haphazardly, spoke in fragments, and the results
were anti-comprehensive. One final observation of Goethe was similar:
He was central to this time, but centralised nothing. He too saw
Nature as everything, if for nothing more than endless empirical study
as did his dear friend Alexander von Humboldt. As Goethe notes, Nature
has endless facets impossible to comprehend as a whole...

#+begin_quote
Nature has no system, she has, she is life and consequence from an
unknown centre out to an unrecognisable perimeter.
#+end_quote

And how could just poetised feelings---Longfellow's piteous ruing of
snowflakes, Novalis' swooning over the night---counter all the violent
dog-eat-dog of mad creation, all the smashing, banging, clanging, all
the shouting, wailing, arguing of real world Britain going on over the
moorland horizon? While Goethe assuredly did, my principals never
attempted to own or direct the aesthetics of their times. After all,
what could have been the artistic, aesthetic compliment to
colonialism, Newtonian science, capitalist industrialism, and the
subsequent Marxist surge?

And therein lies so much of the irony and paradox of what my
principals stirred up. What sense did naming William "Dances With
Daffodils" Wordsworth poet laureate of the British Empire
make?[fn:112] No, indeed, what the Romantic Era poets and artists
created was, as we might categorise (sic) it, a very /underground/
aesthetic, an anti-movement that blanched and faded in the presence of
political debate, that called no seekers, no bhikkhus, no one
torturing themselves into the lotus position to seek higher spiritual
planes. Grim was the new industrial urban world where the once
blithely subsistence peasants was compelled to migrate into hellscape
cities to become wage slaves, living in squalor, hunger, and
exploitation. /Homo homini lupus/ [fn:113] had raised its terrible
head in a new and awful way. The /radical philosophers/, as the
proto-Marxist activists were called by some, attacked seeking to
violently wrest power from the wealthy, i.e., the modern haves versus
the have-nots. Marxist dialectics insisted that when the gradient
became too great necessarily the revolution will begin.[fn:114] But my
principals seemed mute. Or were they?

From the start many opposed what Romanticism seemed to be doing and
saying. Goethe and Schiller promoted as an alternative their /Weimar
Classicism/. To their thinking, some neo-classicism was the best
compliment to modern man. But then what aesthetic could compliment
real-world imperialism? Obviously an art touting glory, majesty,
splendor, regality, grandeur to justify, substantiate whatever
terrible things were going out on the imperial frontiers. Even more
poignant was the classicist envelope around religion, elevating the
huge paradox of pious, compassionate Christianity as a seemingly
stop-at-nothing empire's real underlying humanistic intentions. All in
all, Romanticism could not be applied anywhere except perhaps on a
walk in Wordworth's Lake District, or from the Brontë's Haworth, out
over the moors to the Top Withens ruins. Indeed, the Wordsworths
offered a new sort of membership to Nature strange and mysterious with
no rationalisations or justifications of industrialism or
imperialism. So very ironic, but yes, Britain seemed to be saying
"Wordsworth is who we truly are" when he was named poet laureate,
ruing silently perhaps absentee capitalism for its environmental
destruction and imperialism for its lack of humble Wordsworthian
nativism. A Britain dominant and ascending seemingly knew it was going
against its true self, violating its collective soul's warranty.

Germany likewise was in political as well as aesthetic uncertainty and
turmoil.

#+begin_quote
In 1806, Napoleon conquered Prussia. French troops occupied and sacked
Weimar, where Goethe had lived since 1775. They broke into Goethe’s
house; many of his friends lost everything. Still, Goethe reconciled
himself to Napoleon’s empire, which he regarded as a *legitimate
successor to the Holy Roman Empire*. \\
---from [[https://shannonselin.com/2016/10/napoleon-met-goethe/][Shannon Selin]], Napoleonic-era historic novelist
#+end_quote

This acceptance of Napoleon's vaguely hinted at republicanism and
supposed modernisations led many German intellectuals to forgive
whatever destruction the French invasion caused, for in the end the
crazy quilt of backwards German postage-stamp-sized principalities
would finally be forced into the "modern era."[fn:115] Or so the
thinking went. But not all were on board. For example, leading
Romanticist painter [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_David_Friedrich][Caspar David Friedrich]] with his /Der Chasseur im
Walde/[fn:116] (/The Chasseur [soldier] in the Forest/) from 1814
depicts a sort of comeuppance for arrogant French modernisation
against timeless, indomitable German Nature. His visual metaphor has a
single French soldier apparently under a spell, obviously lost and
separated from the French retreat from Russia, while the symbol of
doom, the raven, waits. If any painter understood Dark, it was Caspar
David Friedrich. Perusing his works, we see he /never/ stoops to
fright memes, but delivers an exquisitely liminal darkness.

*** Nostalgia and going home

#+begin_quote
Oh sure, I'm nostalgic. But not about dentistry. I don't want any
retro-, old-fashion dentistry. \\
---anonymous comedian
#+end_quote

Novalis promoted a nostalgia for the Medieval Era---which only
confused his contemporaries. Likewise, Walpole was all in for medieval
in his more melodramatic way. Later, critiques of /Jane Eyre/ chided
its nostalgic, rustic appeal for English moorlands. All Brontëan
writing has the thread of rootedness to the land, which should be
timeless, but then was often seen as all too twee nostalgic. What then
is going on with nostalgia? What are we doing when we are nostalgic?

The Brontë sisters languished in obscurity most of their
lives,[fn:117] but as they gradually gained popular recognition in the
latter half of the eighteenth century, Victorian Neo-Romantics kept up
with portraying a softer, kinder Britain separate from the capitalist
industrialist, imperialist militarist reality. Miss Jane Eyre,
suspected of fairy ancestry, incessantly asked, Who and what am I?
Which was answered, "You are a charge of the land and your people."
Thus was a delicate bundle of Dark, Nature, and Christianity tied
together by the Brontë sisters. But could it last, could it hold up
against the avalanche of realism and modernism coming out of
industrialism in the Late Victorian Age? Or, from a different angle
let us ask, How did Romanticism die? Or if it's always in the air per
Professor Berlin, how was it driven back underground?

Consider the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood founded in 1848, an arguably
Neo-Romantic effort. Below is a later painting of John Everett
Millais, his /An Idyll of 1745/

#+begin_export html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Everett_Millais#/media/File:An_Idyll_of_1745_(Millais).jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./images/Millais AnIdyllof1745.jpg" width="780" alt="Millais Idyll"></a>
<span class="cap">Before internet social media and hysterical helicopter parents...</span>
#+end_export

Millais is dealing in what I call /profane/ or /vulgar/ nostalgia, as
opposed to /sacred/ nostalgia, which is a hearkening, yearning for the
profoundly eternal and epic such as mythos and legend. Either way,
nostalgia should not be seen as merely escapism to the past. And yet
we surely will not have our emotion bundles thrummed as Millais
thrummed emotion bundles of that time. Of course the Britain of 1745
had power---after favourable political events (e.g., Treaty of
Utrecht) and Robert Walpole's era as prime minister. 1745 was the year
of the main Jacobite rebellion; hence, the patriotic theme? In
general, this was not yet sovereign, domineering Britain; rather, a
Britain still fighting and scrapping for its position in the world,
mainly against the French, as well as still suffering the collective
PTSD of Jacobitism and the bloody seventeenth-century British civil
wars less than a hundred years earlier. Still, Millais painting this
in 1884 would hearkened back, however vulgarly, to, yes, an /idyllic/
time---at least as he thought provided by the seemingly eternal
English countryside, raised up above all as Britain's first and
foremost national treasure. In the semi-wild setting are three
innocent, tabula rasa peasant girls enraptured by an enlisted man
playing a flute, while a fatherly high-born officer looks on
admiringly. Clearly, this pastoral and class bliss was a version of
Britain longed for by the nostalgia-heavy, Romanticism-influenced
Pre-Raphaelites. Great ruing and regretting permeated Victorian
parlour society vis-à-vis the real world, spurring them to search the
earlier Romantic Era and to see in nature vitality and
salvation. Notice to the right Millais' /The Blind Girl/.[fn:118] This
was the down-home England they sought and idealised over the harsh
realities of colonialism and imperialism, the horrific suffering of
the urban industrial wastelands Charles Dickens came to chronicle over
and over throughout this time.

"English Zen" and English nostalgia against the unrelenting brutality
of the world. Romanticism's right bookend was supposedly 1850. But did
it die, retire, was it replaced? No, no, and no---in part, I would
say, exactly because it was never anything as intentional and
wrappable boxable as the watchers and minders wanted it to
be. Romanticism was like an ongoing silent-bid auction always
interrupted just before the sale. So, was nostalgia-heavy Tennyson a
Romanticist? What about Yeats' /The Stolen Child/ from 1889

#+begin_verse
Come away, O human child!
To the waters and the wild
With a faery, hand in hand,
For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.
#+end_verse

I should also mention James Macpherson's /The Poems of Ossian/, like
Walpole's /Otranto/, was the supposed field collections of the
legendary Celtic bard Oisín, although most scholars believe Macpherson
largely composed the poems himself, drawing in part on traditional
Gaelic poetry he had researched. As Wikipedia says

#+begin_quote
Though the stories "are of endless battles and unhappy loves", the
enemies and causes of strife are given little explanation and
context. Characters are given to killing loved ones by mistake, and
dying of grief, or of joy. There is very little information given on
the religion, culture or society of the characters, and buildings are
hardly mentioned. The landscape "is more real than the people who
inhabit it. Drowned in eternal mist, illuminated by a decrepit sun or
by ephemeral meteors, it is a world of greyness."
#+end_quote

Yes, Dark, but clearly more of the predominant Medieval Age nostalgia
carried on in the eighteenth century, especially since the
authenticity is highly suspect, i.e., wishful and aggrandising penning
on the part of MacPherson.

Arthur Conan Doyle believed in fairies. Julia Margaret Cameron, half
of her life spent after 1850, conjured nostalgia in her
ground-breaking photography with its soft-focus and historical
themes.[fn:119] Nostalgia, originally a medical condition,[fn:120]
morphed into the social-psychological phenomenon of idolising the
past, vulgar nostalgia selectively reviving, reanimating hoped-for
aspects of the past. Nostalgia's motivation? Again, eighteenth-century
gothic doom coincided with the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution's inflexion point, as well as the ghastly reverberations of
colonialism, e.g., slavery. Doom, indeed, as the wages of sin's
ever-compounding interest overwhelms any short-term profits or
gains. Here is how J.R.R. Tolkien responded when his fantasy writings
were called /escapist/

#+begin_quote
Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is
imprisoned by the enemy, don’t we consider it his duty to escape?
#+end_quote

Tolkien went on to say the prisoner's natural urge is to escape and
run home. Where is this home? Granted, the intersection of nostalgia
and Dark is minimal, but I say mist dims light, softens lines, and all
nostalgia involves the obscurants mist and shadow. Nostalgia is mainly
for the thrumming of the emotion braid and not hardly the calibration
of the logic train. But yes, home---perhaps the home Jane Eyre
described with the Rivers family on the Northern moorlands? Tolkien
as a Neo-Victorian Luddite closet-Monarchist was the next stepping
stone after George MacDonald, Tolkien's idol. So who is a stepping
stone after Tolkien, who before MacDonald?... But yes, it is always
about home. Ursula Le Guin said an adult is not a dead child, rather a
child that survived. But can that child in us take a faery
hand-in-hand and return to the water and the wild?  Faerie as a
hyper-idealised European homeland paralleling Abrahamic
Middle-eastern Eden? Consider Elizabeth Siddal, (1829 - 1862)[fn:121]
model, artist, poetess, her /Gone/

#+begin_verse
To touch the glove upon her tender hand,
To watch the jewel sparkle in her ring,
Lifted my heart into a sudden song
As when the wild birds sing.

To touch her shadow on the sunny grass,
To break her pathway through the darkened wood,
Filled all my life with trembling and tears
And silence where I stood.

I watch the shadows gather round my heart,
I live to know that she is gone

Gone gone for ever, like the tender dove
That left the Ark alone.
#+end_verse

Indeed, this living, this witnessing to know what is gone chain
link-like into the past. Then Siddal's /Lord May I Come?/

#+begin_verse
Life and night are falling from me,
Death and day are opening on me,
Wherever my footsteps come and go,
Life is a stony way of woe.
Lord, have I long to go?

Hallow hearts are ever near me,
Soulless eyes have ceased to cheer me:
Lord may I come to thee?

Life and youth and summer weather
To my heart no joy can gather.
Lord, lift me from life’s stony way!
Loved eyes long closed in death watch for me:
Holy death is waiting for me

Lord, may I come to-day?

My outward life feels sad and still
Like lilies in a frozen rill;
I am gazing upwards to the sun,
Lord, Lord, remembering my lost one.
O Lord, remember me!

How is it in the unknown land?
Do the dead wander hand in hand?
God, give me trust in thee.

Do we clasp dead hands and quiver
With an endless joy for ever?
Do tall white angels gaze and wend
Along the banks where lilies bend?
Lord, we know not how this may be:
Good Lord we put our faith in thee

O God, remember me.
#+end_verse

Whether the propriety of sacred nostalgia or the handy, heart-warming
profane nostalgia, the eighteenth century saw Nostalgia capitalised as
the West sought to envision, inhabit a home of yore, necessarily bound
to the eternal land and honouring the memories of the ancestors
... and all this rather darkly. Indeed, Miss Siddal, we live to know
what is gone.

*** Desensitisation, re-sensitisation

With an ever-faster-spinning planet there is antagonism, chafing with

#+begin_quote

but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every

#+end_quote

...humanity born of Spirit forever feeling wind in our faces and
circling around wisdom ... almost as if we may find a sanctity in what
may emerge from such consciousness above behaviorist
stimulus-response, action-reaction, beyond the modern gauge of the
personal logic train, beside the day's to-dos---orderings, changes,
updates, progress. All comes down to a battle of feeling versus logic
and measurement, vulnerability versus hubris. Retreat through
the mists back to the land versus a well-lit, outward-facing,
conquering logic. Two sides of the same logos? Balance perhaps desires
one side increase to compensate for the other.

Perhaps my Romantic Era principals sensed the new
hyper-individualistic, utilitarian, /reptilian/ mindset coming at them
from the middle-class capitalist industrialists and saw it rightly as
an egregious desensitisation regime spreading throughout society. And
so they threw /re-sensitisation/ at it. The stereotypical middle-class
industrialist rising during the Enlightenment was a pragmatic
utilitarian who, after absorbing the message of Adam Smith's /The
Wealth of Nations/ (1776), had shucked off [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noblesse_oblige][noblesse oblige]],[fn:122]
the New Testament beatitudes, and any lingering other-century
nostalgia and sentimentality to forge ahead as the consummate
self-reliant individualist who was laser-focused on financial
wealth. No doubt these types projected a hard, stripped-down emotional
psychological persona, indeed, a new desensitisation
regime. Capitalism, Marxism, modernism in general, dispensed with
traditional aesthetics, forcing my principals to shore up an
aesthetical foundation. But as I say, there was no call to political
action, and really no definite prescription of aesthetics either, just
their fatalist, nostalgic Englishness and Germanity. But could they
succeed? Could they through lines of poetry place something of value
on a level above the fray?

** The Romantic Movement compartmentalised

#+begin_quote

---Ecclesiastes 12:12
#+end_quote

And yet academe's version of so-called Romanticism is still a very big
elephant in the middle of our darkly-inclining room.[fn:123] And so
what to do with this beast wont to obfuscate, to blunt and talk to
death the work of my genial, gifted principals? When not /completely/
missing the Dark Muse point, academia wants to pigeonhole it as gothic
fright. Again, one of the main tasks of WutheringUK is to get Dark out
of its academic and popular media ruts. Nonetheless, we should review
the compartments of the Romanticism box.

*** German and English Romanticism: parallel but cross-fertilising?

Romanticism scholars are all over the map with theories. For
example, Andrea Wulf in her /Magnificent Rebels/ depicts Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe as a sort of adult-supervision den dad of the Jena
Set, and yet here is something he actually said about Romanticism

#+begin_quote
Klassisch ist das Gesunde, romantisch das Kranke ... \\
or further\\
... Romanticism is disease. It is the weak, the sickly, the battle cry
of a school of wild poets and Catholic reactionaries; whereas
classicism is strong, fresh, gay, sound, like Homer and the
/Nibelungenlied/.
#+end_quote

I won't accuse Wulf of poor research or intentional obfuscation, but
something went wrong with /Magnificent Rebels/. Having been a founder
of /Sturm und Drang/, Goethe might have been of two minds. Perhaps he
was initially attracted to all the buzz around Jena, all the /haute
pensée/ sprung up in his backyard, but then soured on its content,
implications, clashed with the personalities behind it. Certainly
Schiller did. Still, Wulf's is a prime example of how diverse, even
contradictory Romantic Era scholarship can be.

To be sure, many contemporaries of the actual artistic producers, my
principals, helped talk Romanticism into existence---the Jena Set,
Coleridge, Germaine de Staël, Emerson in America, et al.---but again,
I believe the actual principals were far-sighted, inward-gazing,
quasi-timeless unicorns not following guidelines nor living up to
anybody's expectations.[fn:124] ... and most certainly they did not
"write to spec" or pastiche, as was fairly obviously the case with
gothic horror novelists. /And so I say once more sifting through all
the academic chaff gets us nowhere versus simply reading and silently
contemplating the product itself/. All for naught is the listing of
facts, dates, and figures, creating categories and pigeonholes,
imagining commonalities, generalities, throwing a formulaic hyperplane
over my lone wolf creators. Caveat emptor, I say. If the purpose of a
poem, as Keats said, is to embolden the soul to accept mystery, then
the typical analytic academic death march must be seen as
counterproductive. For me at least, my principals /re-sensitised/,
while their describers and explainers have only managed to
/de-sensitise/ with their left-brain-bound approach.

Some insight to this antagonism comes from two men of that era who
unfortunately wore both creator and explainer hats: Samuel Taylor
Coleridge and Edgar Allan Poe. With them we see how their creations
might take us into the ephemeral mists of Romanticism's subtleties and
sublimities, while their intellectualizations and pontifications
thereof only sound windy, if not shrill out to ridiculous.[fn:125] And
yet the urban salons of the time necessarily trafficked in rational,
left-brain talk and copy. And this is for me the /crisis of
Romanticism/, i.e., the huge divide between the creators and their
content versus their contemporary describers and promoters. And so I
say yes Mr Keats, we shall luxuriate long in the lake, but then
slowly, gently swim back to the shore to gracefully and silently rise
out of the water and stand on the bank exulted for the whole
experience. Of course we cannot luxuriate in the lake forever, but
upon dry land we must somehow hold the experience in awe and reverence
and not grasp for logical explanations, which can only turn it into a
show, a farce, even so, a sham, a carcass.

Today a hit song or a TikTok video can go globally "viral" in less
than a day, with imitations instantly springing up like mushrooms
after rain. However, in the closing years of the eighteenth century
there just seemed to be something in the air, which, fatefully, came
to be called Romanticism, called so first by Jena Set founder
Friedrich Schlegel[fn:126] The prima facie seeds were works from
Coleridge and Wordsworth's collaboration /Lyrical Ballads/ (first
edition) appearing in 1798 and Novalis' /HttN/ in 1800. And yet my
principle principal, Emily Brontë, wrote decades later and arguably
knew very little if not absolutely nothing about Jena, Novalis---or
even much of Coleridge and Wordsworth other than perhaps a reading of
their /Lyrical Ballads/. Later, Poe is said to have encountered
translations of Ludwig Tieck's short stories. Otherwise,
cross-fertilisation was a sketchy thing. For example, brother and
sister William and Dorothy Wordsworth spent some seven months in
Germany between 1898 and 1899, but were there only to save money and
perhaps learn German. They apparently had no idea of Novalis or Jena
Romanticism starting up at that time!

What is called /Early German Romanticism/[fn:127] began when Novalis'
/HttN/ burst upon the scene in the very first year of the nineteenth
century. Clear to me, however, is that /HttN/ was a one-off that came
out of the blue, thus, certainly not intentional, positioned for, or
tailored to any specific trend or agenda. Contrast this with Goethe's
play /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Tauris_(Goethe)][Iphigenia in Tauris]]/ (versions in 1779, 1781, 1786), based on
Euripides' original, and specifically meant to showcase Goethe's ideal
of modern classicism, i.e., his and Friedrich Schiller's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Classicism][Weimar
Classicism]].[fn:128] Enter the /Jena Set/, centred around the Schlegel
brothers, August Wilhelm and Friedrich, along with August's wife
Caroline, who seized upon the mostly absentee Novalis as their boy
wonder /Liebling/ mascot---and the conflation of producer and
describers began in earnest. But just one year after /HttN/ appeared,
Novalis died on them. Though the seed had sprouted and the Jena Set
went on to create an entire mountain range of Jena Romanticism which
had little to do with their boy-man hero Novalis' scattered utterances
and writings. After philosopher [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte][Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] fell out of
favour, the young, dynamic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling][Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]] came
on board; and it is his /nature philosophy/ which became Jena
Romanticism's house brand, eventually adopted and promoted by
Coleridge (sometimes as literal translation as in his [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographia_Literaria][Biographia
Literaria]] - 1817), then by Emerson and the Transcendentalists in the
Colonies. Again, all of this shambling and churning misses Dark
entirely! Thus, right from the start Dark is obscured behind a wall of
theorising and intellectualisations. Alas.

*** Poe and Dark Romanticism

/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Romanticism][Dark Romanticism]]/ (DR) would be an even more unfortunate academe box
sporting the adjective dark. At its centre was supposedly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe][Edgar Allan
Poe]].[fn:129] Alas but the Wikipedia description of DR trots out all
the negative stereotypes of Dark. As one biographer noted, Poe
struggled all his short adult life to make a living as a writer and
poet. One supposed quote of his said

#+begin_quote
Your writer of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big
pen, with a very blunt nib.
#+end_quote

My take on Poe was that, as I said above, he led a Dr Jekyll, Mr Hyde
literary existence. The American publishing world was rarely
supportive, as one biographer said, eager to move on from anything
gothic. And yet Poe always seemed to amaze and find though back doors
an audience.

Poe's best known poem was /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven][The Raven]]/, which wound through the
publishing world---mainly periodicals and newspapers---throughout
1845, finally landing in a collection of Poe's poems in the summer
of 1845. And by the twentieth century, school children would learn by
heart at least the first stanza

#+begin_verse
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore---
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door---
            Only this and nothing more."
#+end_verse

and if you were a good student, perhaps even the second stanza

#+begin_verse
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;---vainly I had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore---
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore---
            Nameless here for evermore.
#+end_verse

then of course /...’Tis the wind and nothing more.../ and other such
evocative snatches. For youth poetry reciting contests, /The Raven/ has
been a standard. But through all this we have what is basically a
throwback to the doom-and-gloom Graveyard School gothic, i.e., not
informed by, e.g., Barbauld's finer sort of Dark.

Following /The Raven/ came Poe's unfortunate essay entitled /The
Philosophy of Composition/ wherein he attempted to reverse-engineer
what he did to come up with /The Raven/. Here's a portion

#+begin_quote
I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of
ill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word "Nevermore" at the
conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length
about one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object-
supremeness or perfection at all points, I asked myself, "Of all
melancholy topics what, according to the universal understanding of
mankind, is the most melancholy?"  Death, was the obvious reply. "And
when," I said, "is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?" From
what I have already explained at some length the answer here also is
obvious, "When it most closely allies itself to Beauty: The death then
of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the
world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for
such topic are those of a bereaved lover."
#+end_quote

Alas, but I just cannot accept that he created /The Raven/ on some
mechanised poetry conveyor belt, speaking of Death capitalised, then
the death of a woman almost as if a gimmick. Again, alas. It gets
worse

#+begin_quote
Most writers---poets in especial---prefer having it understood that
they compose by a species of fine frenzy---an ecstatic intuition---and
would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the
scenes, at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought, at the
true purposes seized only at the last moment, at the innumerable
glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view, at the
fully-matured fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable, at the
cautious selections and rejections, at the painful erasures and
interpolations---in a word, at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for
scene-shifting, the step-ladders, and demon-traps, the cock's
feathers, the red paint and the black patches, which, in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, constitute the properties of the literary
histrio [actor, player].
#+end_quote

Cringe. He sounds ashamed about falling into a state of "ecstatic
intuition," as if he is surrounded by peers around whom he had better
not sound too airy-floaty. Or maybe he wanted to say, "'Twas
nothing. Just follow my formula, and you too can write a nice, dark
poem that'll have them all weeping." Super cringe.

Personally, I do believe /The Raven/ came from something
ecstatic---out to trance and vision. Again, Poe was simply an erratic
character who seemed to change personalities often. But sometimes I
want /The Raven/ to be about the death of Romanticism. If academe says
the last breath escaped circa 1850, then perhaps I could read into the
lines a lamenting of the passing of an era symbolised by a beautiful,
virtuous woman Leanore. Allow me, please.

And so here I want to make a very important point about my principals,
to be sure, /that they were only vessels,/ those particular mortals
the Muses chose to be their emissaries. This angle is well developed
in the Hollywood film /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)][Amadeus]]/ where Mozart[fn:130] was depicted as
an immature, outta-control brat, while all the same the conduit of
heavenly music. As alluded above, Novalis was likely just such a
boy-wonder Amadeus sort, Poe often enough mercurial, Emily Brontë
austere anorexic, Emily Dickinson a spinster recluse. Looking too
closely into their personal stories gets us no closer to discovering
the origins of their inspiration---in other words, another academe
dead end, so leave off already! As writer and artist Kahil Gibran said
about children in his /The Prophet/, they come /through/ us, they are
not /of/ us.

Though Poe's own descriptions of his "place of creative origin" was
surprisingly insightful. He once mentioned the state of having
"thoughts behind thoughts." Which is something I found described in a
[[https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/neuregulin-1-genie-und-schizophrenie-moeglicherweise-folge-eines-gens-a-870089.html][/Der Spiegel/ article]] from 2012 about the link between creativity and
/schizophrenia/. Basically, an "expression" of the gene Neuregulin 1
(NRG1), which supposedly is key in regulating "synaptic plasticity"
can sometimes be amiss, but not so amiss that full-on schizophrenia
results. Instead of full debilitation with phantom voices and raging
paranoia, a "schizoid lite" sufferer will have the hidden underground
river of wild disassociated thoughts, but be able to control it, even
tap into it. After reading this Der Spiegel article scales fell from
my eyes---it described me! Here is an example of a poem I wrote

#+begin_verse
Dark burgundy roses, cobalt irises
Delivered for the night's performance,
To the theatre in the hollow, */le théâtre de la combe/*.
Village-bound now, the hollow once a fairy circle,
Long since fairy dream haunted.
Look down from the sacred grove, now the square.
Recall the one attendance as a child:
Visions of darker, older nights since. 

Escape to the countryside;
Great sunlight to dispel dark fairy rumour.
Yet the pale blue sky but tissue, the thinnest canopy.
Indigo lace swirling, grey clouds, fog billowing.
Incessant winds to lift and shred the canopy
Till starless void revealed...

... darkness, and a chill wind rises up
The cobblestone /ruelle/ from the hollow.
On this night of many nights as one,
Dark purple clouds stripe a moon large and orange,
Placed just above /le théâtre de la combe/.
#+end_verse

As far as describing my creative process I remember becoming fixated
upon a nighttime scene of a narrow, winding, cobblestone,
other-century street and a small theatre therein. And the rest simply
came from the underground river of /thought rumour/ below my direct
consciousness. For further evidence I might add a section of my novel
/Emily of Wolkeld/. Here is Emily describing her special place

#+begin_quote
She gazed once more at the broken outline of Wolkeld Hall through the
trees, letting her concentration slip and her eyes glaze. She
listened after that strange place in her mind from which bits
and pieces of scenes played beyond her comprehension, where
shadows of thoughts never quite became clear. Though at times
something would suddenly stand before her and demand her best
attempt at a poetisation.

Since Kansas, since puberty, she would occasionally find herself
slipping into some further space beyond the secret compartments. But
again, she could only sense, partially comprehend this expansive,
twilit region, fleeting, but long dominating her heart and mind. At
first she considered such flights just intense day-dreaming, but over
time they became less imagined, more a definite communion with a
distinctly separate realm. It was a dusky world, steeped in sublime
melancholic loneliness, often large and panoramic. At first she found
it worrisome---not some clear religious transport of light and
ecstasy. And yet she came to believe good was speaking, not evil, nor
for that matter any sort of lurking mental illness. She wished it to
be something of her soul’s true home, perhaps some distant view of
Cumbria---at least that was the place to which she always mapped it,
for which she yearned immediately thereafter.
#+end_quote

The queen of this sort of /Schizophrenia Lite™/ is of course Emily
Dickinson, whose lines often disappear into this underground
region. Reading her hundreds of little one-, two-, three-stanza bursts
leaves me certain she was definitely Schizo-lite™

#+begin_verse
A thought went up my mind to-day
That I have had before,
But did not finish, --- some way back,
I could not fix the year,

Nor where it went, nor why it came
The second time to me,
Nor definitely what it was,
Have I the art to say.

But somewhere in my soul, I know
I've met the thing before;
It just reminded me --- 't was all ---
And came my way no more.
#+end_verse

Bright gems, one after the other, poured out of that terribly gentle,
unimaginably deep woman. Sigh...

Now, on to what I consider Poe's best poem, namely, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabel_Lee][Annabel Lee]]/

#+begin_verse
It was many and many a year ago,
   In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
   By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
   Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love---
   I and my Annabel Lee---
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
   Coveted her and me.

And this was the reason that, long ago,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
   My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsmen came
   And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
   In this kingdom by the sea.

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
   Went envying her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
   Of those who were older than we---
   Of many far wiser than we---
And neither the angels in Heaven above
   Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;

For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
   In her sepulchre there by the sea---
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.

If there is a better American example of the Dark Muse, I don't know
it. Here Poe is contemplative melancholic, rather than flogging fright
as he does in his prose. I wonder if Poe knew of Novalis and his
supposed one hundred nights of graveside vigilance for deceased Sophie
von Kühn? Perhaps, but irrelevant. Again, I suss out that both Poe and
Emily Brontë grasped the Dark Muse and found expression through their
poetry---but, again, so ironically, not through their prose where they
could only fall back into gothic handle-cranking. And so I fall back
to poetry and fragmented bursts as the only vehicle of true Dark.

I would add that Poe, of my principle principals, was undoubtedly the
best educated and informed. He would have known Greek mythology best,
i.e., all about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanatos][Thanatos]], Nyx, Hypnos, the Underworld and, in general,
the classic Greek proto-gothic take on death and night. And yet he
delivers in his /Annabel Lee/ our new sort of Dark Muse.[fn:131]

** Emily Brontë's (unintended?) worldview

Here I will simply and plainly state (gush) that Emily Jane Brontë is
the very centre of my Dark Muse. Through just a handful of her poems
she embodies for me the heart and soul of what I consider /base/ Dark
and /real/ Romanticism. But as mentioned above, she has largely been
left out of any Romanticism boxing or packaging.[fn:132]

Though many are surprised when I say forget her book /Wuthering
Heights/, which for me is just stock old-school gothic, however
artistically potent we may find it.[fn:133] I said this before---and,
yes, it may seem odd and counter-intuitive---but prose, loaded down
with depictions of human mundanity as it must be, is doomed, as it
simply cannot do for Dark what poetry can. Likewise, Poe lost much
altitude when he would switch from poetry to prose---however much fame
he might have won from his short stories. I insist Brontë and Poe said
deep and lasting things about the Dark Muse in their lyric verse, but
really only added pulp to the gothic shelf with their
storytelling. Again, I insist gothic is a second-hand derivative, a
Platonic cave shadow of true Dark. Yes, blasphemy to many of you, but
as always, YMMV, your mileage may vary...

Of course there's no denying the human being is very
narrative-oriented. Basically, we crave /original time/ mythology. But
a telling, a story must be of legend import and gestalt;[fn:134]
otherwise, it runs the risk of being confusing, misleading, that is to
say /false/ legend, exciting our psychic legend receptor sites,
stirring up archetypes, only to lead us hither and thither, but in the
end doing us no real service for all the innervation. Which eventually
can only lead to burnout and collective madness.[fn:135] What?!
Really? Yes! And where did I get such a crazy idea? From a Native
American on the Blackfoot Reservation many years ago who adamantly
insisted his people's traditional legends were true and not just
children's fairy tales. He insisted[fn:136] our white-man science was
pointless and told us nothing worth knowing, and, worse!, that our
fictional novels, plays, and films were /false legends/, and that we
were a bunch of hapless, delusional fools chasing after false
legends![fn:137] Not kidding. But as has (thankfully!) often happened
in my life, this encounter knocked another layer of scales from my
eyes and light shined through, connections and eurekas ensued.

One quick in-place aside. It is terribly ironic how we would never
have known Emily Brontë's poetry had not big sister Charlotte pilfered
her manuscripts from their hiding place and had them published without
Emily's permission. Similarly, the reclusive Emily Dickinson only saw
some ten poems published, but after her death /over a seventeen
hundred/ were discovered in her room and subsequently published. And
so I wonder, how many Barbaulds, Brontës, Dickinsons, Poes fell back
under the waves never to be known? As with so many like the Amherst
and Haworth Emilies, /we found them, they didn't find us/. Alas.

Let me restart by saying Haworth Emily combined in her /poetry/

+ *Nature*,
+ *Dark*, and
+ *Christianity*

though in keeping with Keats' /Negative Capability/, no one or two
overshadowed the other two or one. Let's imagine a doughty frontier
one-room school teacher who forces the rowdy peasant boys of
blood-feuding families, Dark, Nature, and Christianity, to sit next to
each other on the school bench and work together. And so I urge you to
simply get the Penguin Classics /Emily Brontë The Complete Poems/ and
read and read and never stop reading Haworth Emily over and over. And
in so doing you will hopefully be able to make this magical Negative
Capability suspension of Nature, Dark, and Christianity hover above
your own heart and mind. Problematic, however, is how some forty-four
of her poems are referencing her [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracosm][paracosm]], her fantasy land
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondal_(fictional_country)][Gondal]]/,[fn:138] and without any surviving backstory, they are
obscure and cannot really be fathomed today.[fn:139] Still, the
remaining poems are gold. I will now single out three key (non-Gondal)
poems[fn:140]

+ /The night is darkening round me/ (once more),
+ /I'll come when thou art saddest/ and
+ /I would have touched the heavenly key/

which appear together as poem 31. in /The Complete Poems/ as a good
start to understanding the Brontëan West Yorkshire moorland philosophy
of life

#+begin_verse
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow;
But a tyrant spell has bound me
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow,
And the storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below;
But nothing drear can move me—
I will not, cannot go.

---

I'll come when thou art saddest,
Laid alone in the darkened room;
When the mad day's mirth has vanished,
And the smile of joy is banished
From evening's chilly gloom.

I'll come when the heart's real feeling
Has entire unbiased sway,
And my influence o'er thee stealing,
Grief deepening joy congealing,
Shall bear thy soul away.

Listen 'tis just the hour,
The awful time for thee;
Dost thou not feel upon thy soul
A flood of strange sensations roll,
Forerunners of a sterner power,
Heralds of me?

---

I would have touched the heavenly key
That spoke alike of bliss and thee;
I would have woke the entrancing song,
But its words died upon my tongue.
But then I knew that he stood free,
Would never speak of joy again,
And then I felt ... 
#+end_verse

Hmm, just more of that strangely flowery, antique-sounding stuff from
back then. And so you may wonder why I assign such importance to these
lines, how they could contain an entire philosophy. As I've said
before, I believe Emily Brontë, being such a marginal, hard-pressed
little bat was singularly qualified to speak to us today. She being
introverted, marginal, unassuming, and yet fiercely determined, stood
during those short years of her life (no doubt unwittingly) at the
nexus of a perfect storm of history, social-psychology, and culture.

I spoke previously of /The night is darkening round me/ (as well as
her /All creation is equally mad.../ quote), and I'll reiterate that
in this one poem she expresses the Dark Muse so very well. First, she
is dealing directly with natural, /source/ Dark---as Nature is the
source of Dark---and not just packaging the icons, prompts, and
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasmagoria][phantasmagoric]] symbols of gothic Dark. She is subservient to, in total
awe of this phenomenon of stormy darkness descending. She owns being
small, insignificant, overwhelmed, overpowered. This is not the
melodramatic resignation of Edward Young, not doom or woe-is-me
fatalism, not the serene reflection of Night School Barbauld. Nor is
she spiritual or reverent per se, which dominates the following two
poems. Instead, she is captivated by something beyond her control,
something seemingly extra-spiritual. She describes a powerful liminal
space created naturally by darkness descending during a snow storm,
wherein she senses a vast mystery and sublimity. Again, if we are the
man who has divorced his wife, but calls her every day, this evening
is one of those rare and portentous phone conversations. Darkness
coming down upon the wild, natural setting transports her, calls out
and speaks to her real self, presenting not just a fleeting /presence
of eternal harmony/ moment, rather, contact with a /*world* of eternal
mystery/. And yes, that world is Dark.

As discussed above, there is the basic Wordsworthian homage to Nature,
i.e., episodes of swooning over, riffing on, paying compliments to an
outdoor scene, e.g., Wordsworth's /Tintern Abbey/. Emily, however, has
been arrested, even rendered lame by Nature's commanding presence
symbolised as a tyrant's spell. And being so much under this tyrant's
spell belies a crisis. A liminal phase phenomenon[fn:141] has
overthrown her mundane, rational human regimen to accost her heart and
mind with something of some incomprehensible Beyond.

Indeed, if she were truly marginal and bat-like, not so very anchored,
not so bought into the "real," mundane world, if she had /shunned the
common paths that other run/,[fn:142] then this twilight storm across
the previously benign wastelands would surely have confronted her with
a compelling alternative to the profane, real world. Instead of an
"everywhere," mapped and ultimately dominated by humans, she glimpses
an "everywhen" rooted in the eternal. It would seem Emily's "God of
Visions" has blessed her. And so we have this everywhen rumour of some
higher world whereof the frail, enthralled narrator may only catch
glimpses presented so compellingly in this short, three-stanza lyrical
poem. Similar to Keller's /Winter Evening/ described above, we may
then wonder how the observer will proceed in life, so overwhelming as
she describes the encounter. Her lines surely embolden the soul to /be
in/ mystery. She creates the intrigue of Dark, she frames mystery by
poetically encoding deep insight borne of experience, of
vulnerability, and ultimately transport.

*** Von Droste-Hülshoff's versus Brontëan Nature 

The German poetess [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_von_Droste-H%C3%BClshoff][Annette Freiin von Droste zu Hülshoff]] (1797 -
1848)[fn:143] in her /Der Knabe im Moor/ (/The boy on the moor/ first
appearing in 1842)[fn:144] likewise speaks of Nature's power as
darkness descends. However, Droste means to bring to us the /fear/ of
nature as a superstitious peasant lad would experience it. Here is my
free prose translation of the first stanza

#+begin_verse
How ominous it is to cross the moor, when its haze, its mists writhing like phantoms bind and weave through the low growth; and up comes a springlet beneath every step, a hissing sung from the ground. How eerie it is to cross the moor when the reeds rustle in the breezes...
#+end_verse

...wild nature so ominously forsaken, so frighteningly forsaken. But
whence this ominous, frightening, and forsaken? Whence the backstory
superstitions? Droste narrates a peasant lad's scary twilight trip
across a semi-wild section of his early-nineteenth century Westphalian
lowlands, describing in terrifying detail how the landscape would seem
to come alive with terrible demonic threats. In the next five verses
the boy succumbs in his growing panic to fantasies of evil spirits and
bad actors; but in the end he makes it back---with perhaps some help
from his guardian angel---to Christian civilization. I bring up
/Der Knabe/ here because both Brontë and Droste are working with
Nature as a /liminal phase/ that has suddenly eclipsed a known,
mundane, daylit locality, becoming either a spell-binding gate to a
higher realm or a downright frightening reintroduction to the
forbidden pagan past.

In both cases the landscape is not some far-removed trackless
wilderness only approachable by Earth-astronaut explorers, rather,
marginal, abandoned spaces. These are not the geographically-dominant
forests of pre-history, wild and savage and brimming with animistic
spirits. Rather, centuries of Christian indoctrination and rationalist
science have come between the human and the greatly shrunken wild
places.

But then neither Brontë out in the storm nor Droste's lost boy
suffered under today's normative anthropocentrism where nature is so
completely contained and explained, so completely demystified. The
liminality channelling once dominant Nature is impacting, gripping yet
impressionable humans. However, we today, so deeply embedded in our
space-station, quasi-Jetsons-like existences, cannot fully appreciate
the eeriness, the out-of-time-and-space transport of someone two
hundred years prior. Nature has impacted, gripped Emily and Annette's
boy as few of us so deep in our rationalist, desensitised,
disassociated mindsets can be reached. And so most of us today will
simply scoff at such experiences as succumbing to irrationalism or
superstition. Both /The night is darkening round me/ and /Knaben im
Moor/ speak to a proto-nostalgia for nature's power and dominance, a
harkening back to a union and tracking with the land that our weaker,
more dissipated, more muddled modern nostalgic impulses cannot plumb.

Let's take an aside to talk about the very important concept of
/liminal space/. Here's a quote found on Reddit from the member
"Killcode2" explaining what a liminal space is

#+begin_quote
Imagine a classroom from your childhood. Surely you are imagining it
in the day, with sunlight spilling in through the windows and kids
shuffling to their desks. This is the state in which a classroom is
most frequently seen and serves a purpose for. Now imagine sneaking
into your school late at night and everything is empty. It is almost
eerie seeing the same classroom at night in a totally different
context. Suddenly its usual purpose has been robbed and it is just a
room---but not quite. Because now it also feels strangely alien and
enigmatic to you, a purposeless, otherworldly architecture. The next
day that room would be back to normal, in its default state. It is
back to being a real classroom. But that middle phase it was in when
you saw it in the night, it's a *liminal phase*, a state of
transition. And often spaces like that carry eerie characteristics,
such as being out of time and out of place. That's liminal spaces for
you. The same could apply for an abandoned mall, an overgrown tree
house, or a swimming pool with all the water gone in the winter.
#+end_quote

We can imagine Droste's boy growing up to be a simple, devout
Westphalian Roman Catholic who lived out the rest of his life under
the lurking fear and dread of that one liminal phase encounter of his
otherwise simple and familiar moorland. He probably instilled this
fear in his children and grandchildren---just as his head had been
filled by the adults around him with legends and stories passed down
for generations...

Droste offers us this commoner take on wilds, i.e., a basic
civilization-bound human reaction to nature. The Church, having
quashed pagan spirituality by ascribing it to Satan, the root of all
evil, ensured that what was wild and far enough removed from the
church and its Eucharist in the altar tabernacle would be associated
with evil and threat. The word /heathen/ (German /heidnisch/) is
derived from /heath/ (/Heide/)---and there we have a direct link
between wilds and pagan, hence evil. And so to venture out on the
heath was to venture into (formerly?) heathen-dominated spaces. Again,
a peasant of Droste's era had no such Earth astronaut mindset as we do
today. To him the awful spirit world of his distant pagan ancestors
was just barely held in check by Jesus and the saints. Where is the
devil? Everywhere! --- /especially/ out on the heath after dark!

Droste underlines a seemingly great limitation of our understanding of
nature, of life itself, namely, the vast majority of us are, and
probably always will be, grossly susceptible to irrationality. As an
aristocrat, she understood that in order to lead the commoners, to
hold the reins, the aristocrat must understand their functional
limitations, and subsequently /cannot ask them to do what they cannot
do, nor go where they cannot go, nor understand what they cannot
understand/. For all intents and purposes, the moorlands are full of
evil after dark, full stop. No attempt at disabusing the commoner of
superstitions is really possible. Droste's is a stasis attitude, thus,
keep things simple and steady is the mantra of the day.[fn:145]

We may contrast this with Emily Brontë's more Protestant-influenced
understanding of her heath. Hers was not the immemorial Catholic
peasant mentality, rather, that of an informed Protestant cleared of
the eisegesis,[fn:146] post-scripture metaphysics supposedly
dominating Catholicism. To give an indication of how different
Catholics and Protestants are on metaphysical phenomena, consider how
thousands of saints are officially recognised by the Catholic
church---most having qualified as saintly due to some metaphysical,
paranormal religious experience.[fn:147] Saintless Protestants, on the
other hand, would seem to exclude anything paranormal miraculous not
mentioned directly in the Old or New Testament of the Bible. Here is
Günter Grass from his novel /The Flounder/ speaking of a priestess of
prehistoric pagan times in his homeland Vistula river delta on the
Baltic Sea

#+begin_quote
Because she was a cook, Mestwina was also a priestess. She raised the
cult of Awa to perfection. And when it came time for us all to be
baptized, she brewed up paganism and Christianity into a Catholic
mixture.
#+end_quote

Like the making of sausage, Grass indicates Catholicism has a few
"early" ingredients we might not want to see.

To be sure, a Brontë sister at the dawn of Queen Victoria's reign
drank a much more filtered and distilled brew. The night Emily
describes is certainly putting on a stormy show, but she is not facing
pagan spirits that had never really quit the Westphalian boy's
landscape. For both, Nature surely takes command, but one witness
wants out and the other is frozen in place, if not wanting in. It
might be said Emily is experiencing something like what Mary felt at
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecce_Ancilla_Domini][The Annunciation]] or Moses with the burning bush. But Emily creates a
new sort of metaphysics, namely, sans religiosity, with Dark as its
ethos. And so what greater connection can a human have with Nature
than to be so completely and deeply transfixed that, for some moments
at least, one cannot go, cannot go? And that power? Some Darkness like
no one had ever seen or experienced---not the Night School, and
certainly not the gothic before. Emily is not reposing in mosses to
behold greenery as did Wordsworth; indeed, this is elemental Nature
taking over. With /The night.../ Emily Brontë has faced down the
age-old fear and threat to become some new citizen of Nature. /Hers is
a post-pagan Nature worship/, some graduation ceremony. And as I must
again emphasise, /this Nature is Dark/ with boughs weighted down, not
daffodils flopping around. Indeed, Dark is a portentous liminal space
experience. With Droste mystery floats on raw fear, while Brontë
embraces goes out into Nature to have mystery blast her. And out at us
rushes Dark like never before---or since. Liminal space Nature:
Tolkien takes us to his nighttime Lothlorien elves, H.P. Lovecraft's
to cosmic demons, but Brontë to a pure, all but metaphysically neutral
Dark---to the deepest Dark yet.

*** I'll come when thou art saddest...

...then Nature is swapped for Christianity as /I'll come when thou art
saddest/ commences. By the early eighteen-hundreds Christianity has
held the torch of spirituality ever since it buried Euro-paganism
after the fall of the Roman Empire. But has it ever figured out what
to do with this torch other than march around demanding us to fall in
behind? One obvious issue is metaphysics---what is it and how much
should there be in lieu of our burgeoning materialism based on science
and technology? And as I say, Protestantism cut the metaphysical down
even closer to the bone that had Catholicism from animist
paganism. And yet Christian piety, reverence, holiness ... doesn't it
all just add up to a holding pattern while we go through our
increasingly civilized, abstracted extra-Nature lives? But as I just
described, Nature and Dark became participatory in a new way when the
Night darkened round Emily.

In /I’ll come when thou art saddest/, Haworth Emily is hearing a very
punitive, severe, grim God who would seem to arrive only in the
human's most dire moments, when /real feeling has entirely unbiased
sway/. Only when we are saddest, alone, joyless, in the dark, close to
our demise does our supreme better come to His lesser for
consultation. Only then do the strange sensations roll as precursors
to a "sterner" power. Which leaves us to believe all previous times
are clouded, ambiguous, dominated by willfulness, foolishness, if not
utter meaninglessness. In any event, Haworth Emily again plumbs a new
depth. A new dimension is opened to life's precariousness, to the
eternal enigma of free will versus mortality. Indeed, to have free
will and yet be short-lived and delicate.

Has anyone ever spoken of God in a more consequentially unrelentingly
and austere way? Perhaps God is gentle and compassionate---but she
does not hide away the awful, miserable, grim, and desperate as
necessary precursors for this particular visitation. Here we have
suffering and demise lowering our human folly and waywardness,
scrapping our conceits, smashing our will ... to open our soul for
that flood of strange sensations heralding God. The Almighty would
seem to say, "You're in a desperate moment. Control of your life has
flown. Now we can get down to business." Emily clearly implies in
these eighty-seven words that we are like a dog that has broken his
leash and run wild, but now in his hour of need, has returned to his
master.

Surely Haworth Emily had heard preachers thunder from the pulpit of
God's terrible wrath as they quoted various violent passages from the
Old Testament. But the God she describes has arrived to calmly discuss
His will, to introduce His sterner power towards that end. Doom
certainly, but this Brontëan version is graduated from common gothic
melodrama. God is not drama of any sort, but the keenest reality we
can know, a private death-bed event of the utmost consequence. Still,
the human is /before/ any sign of redemption and forgiveness, and so
is threatened by the most complete and utter doom... Let me say, there
is little of the "good new" of Jesus in the Brontëan world. Somewhat
surprising that.

I come away believing no one sees God quite like she did, no one in or
out of scripture has described a more ominous and material meeting of
God and man. But then with whom could she have ever spoken about such
things? Her cleric father? Doubtful. He too much the Church of England
company man.[fn:148] Charlotte, Anne? Perhaps. And yet some impasse
might have prevented that, antagonisms, codependency ruts, as we might
now say. After all, she hid most of her poetry from the world. Here is
another insight into her mind, a poem called /The Philosopher/

#+begin_verse
'Enough of thought, philosopher!
Too long hast thou been dreaming
Un[en]lightened, in this chamber drear,
While summer’s sun is beaming!
Space-sweeping soul, what sad refrain
Concludes thy musings once again?

'"Oh, for the time when I shall sleep
Without identity.
And never care how rain may steep,
Or snow may cover me!
No promised heaven, these wild desires
Could all, or half fulfil;
No threatened hell, with quenchless fires,
Subdue this quenchless will!"

'So said I, and still say the same;
Still, to my death, will say---
Three gods, within this little frame,
Are warring night; and day;
Heaven could not hold them all, and yet
They all are held in me;
And must be mine till I forget
My present entity!
Oh, for the time, when in my breast
Their struggles will be o’er!
Oh, for the day, when I shall rest,
And never suffer more!

'I saw a spirit, standing, man,
Where thou dost stand---an hour ago,
And round his feet three rivers ran,
Of equal depth, and equal flow---
A golden stream---and one like blood;
And one like sapphire seemed to be;
But, where they joined their triple flood
It tumbled in an inky sea
The spirit sent his dazzling gaze
Down through that ocean's gloomy night;
Then, kindling all, with sudden blaze,
The glad deep sparkled wide and bright---
White as the sun, far, far more fair
Than its divided sources were!

'And even for that spirit, seer,
I’ve watched and sought my life-time long;
Sought him in heaven, hell, earth, and air,
An endless search, and always wrong.
Had I but seen his glorious eye
ONCE light the clouds that wilder me;
I ne'er had raised this coward cry
To cease to think, and cease to be;
I ne'er had called oblivion blest,
Nor stretching eager hands to death,
Implored to change for senseless rest
This sentient soul, this living breath---
Oh, let me die---that power and will
Their cruel strife may close;
And conquered good, and conquering ill
Be lost in one repose!'
#+end_verse

I won't say here is a counter-example, though it belies a very strong
willed person---who will make her mental and spiritual breakthrough or
fall into despair. She will resolve her three-way cognitive
dissonance, or insist on oblivion. What then are these three rivers
this self-loathing voice speaks of? Presumptuous of me to assume they
are Dark, Nature, and Christianity. But I have no doubt her mind was,
indeed, wracked by conflicting thoughts, cognitive dissonances, which
she could not always bear serenely. Though this willfulness is not
that of egotism or pettiness. She berates fate, God, eternity for not
giving her at least one moment of the eternal harmony of her three
rivers united. Honest petulance.

*** I would have touched the heavenly key...

Repeating,

#+begin_verse
I would have touched the heavenly key
That spoke alike of bliss and thee;
I would have woke the entrancing song,
But its words died upon my tongue.
But then I knew that he stood free,
Would never speak of joy again,
And then I felt...

#+end_verse

I would have put more faith, more stock in Jesus, or in salvation
while living, or in the tantalising promises of Heaven. But again, she
could not mouth the supposed "good news" of Christ. Bliss might be
fleetingly known while on Earth, but woe and doom must be endured to
the bitter end, as a expurgate of pride, foolishness, and sinfulness,
as the fate of a race too weak, too unworthy of even glimpses of
heavenly bliss.

Then not Heaven but Earth---as God has so constructed our earthly
"starter" experience. I see this seemingly grim surrender, abstaining
throughout her poetry, a resolved humility to stay on Earth---even
after death.

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Heber][Reginald Heber]]'s /Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!/, surely an
entrancing song speaking of bliss and Thee would have died upon
Emily's tongue, as she seemingly eschewed any indulgence of imaginings
of heaven and God's majesty while serving out her earthly sentence

#+begin_verse
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!

Holy, holy, holy! all the saints adore Thee,
casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;
cherubim and seraphim, falling down before Thee,
which wert and art and evermore shalt be.

Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee,
though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;
only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee,
perfect in pow'r, in love, and purity.

Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth and sky and sea;
Holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!
#+end_verse

Dutiful Anne would have sung full-throated. Charlotte perhaps less
so. But Emily, yes, only mouthed. No coward soul was hers, faith so
very strong---but then this Christian triumphalist boosterism, this
perfunctory marching behind the Christian torch probably left her in a
state both moved but also of stunned ennui.[fn:149]

And so Emily would wish for nothing more than what she had of Nature
on Earth, that she, too human, too accustomed to Earth, should want
anything of any Beyond but to taste its awe. And that this awe came
mostly from imbibing Dark.

** My sepulchre by the sea?

One of my earliest encounters with what I might now categorise as
Dostoevski's /presence of eternal harmony/ (POEH) came on a dark
Halloween evening back when I was a little boy of six years in my
small Southern Illinois town. We were trick-or-treating on my street,
the oldest in town with its cobblestone, gas streetlights, and
Victorians, and at some point I knew I had entered another place,
another time. Being so young meant I was not completely disabused of
the extra-normal; thus, other worlds, other dimensions did not seem
out of the ordinary. I remember looking up into the dense, bare
branches of the giant trees to see the moon beaming through the
crossing clouds and feeling like I was a part of some special magical
world. Throughout my life I've compared subsequent POEH experiences
with that Halloween night. Perhaps this is why I cleave to the Dark
Muse. Allow me to insert an appropriate Haworth Emily here

#+begin_verse
O dream, where art thou now?
Long years have passed away
Since cast from off thine angel brow
I saw the light decay ---

Alas! alas for me!
Thou wert so bright and fair,
I could not think thy memory
Would yield me nought but care!

The moonbeam and the storm,
The summer eve divine,
The silent night of solemn calm,
The full moon's cloudless shine

Were once entwined with thee,
But now with weary pain ---
Lost vision! 'tis enough for me ---
Thou canst not shine again ---
#+end_verse

Yes, where has my childhood "dream" so opposite the "real" world taken
me? I live in a world, a time that would have me deny, forget, repress
such childhood magic, if for no other reason than they bring "nought
but care." Nevertheless, I know my "lost vision" cannot shine again.

Scoffers will scoff, and no doubt what I just shared can easily be
dismissed as the imaginings of an impressionable small child; but as
a character in one of my stories says, "Magic, it's just in your
head---until it's not anymore." Truly, I've tried to be the atheist
rationalist science type, but my heart was never really in
it. Throughout my "career" I wore a physics, a math, and finally a
computer hat. And although STEM paid the bills, in the long run the
whole sci-tech scene just never felt like home. Science people can be
the nicest people you'd ever want to meet, but at the end of the day
they just weren't my crowd. Now I'm back to believing things I did
when I was six, and still seeking my people. Often enough I simply
create my crowd in fictional short stories and novels.

How did my dark inclinations continue? Whether you saw all the
Hollywood horror films or not, /everyone/ of my generation knows the
television shows /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family][The Addams Family]]/ and /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Munsters][The Munsters]]/. Odd as those
series were, we all seemed to "get" the premise and laugh along with
the basic goths-versus-normies gag. Likewise, the biggest film of my
childhood, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz][The Wizard of Oz]]/ had many gothic themes, especially the
Wicked Witch of the West and her very creepy flying monkeys and
castle.[fn:150]

My teen years were influenced mainly by all the progressive Woodstock
Era memes, especially the music of the day, the only Dark exposure
coming from my paternal grandmother, who channelled a very Victorian
Englishness, inherited as we understood from her model Victorian
mother. She exuded a proto-Downton Abbey aura, something none of us in
that small Southern Illinois small town could fathom---until we
finally saw Maggie Smith's Violet Crawley, the Dowager Countess of
Grantham!

My Grandma Grace Virginia did not possess great intellect or culture,
and yet she was a potent carrier of the even then quickly-fading
Victorian mega-paradigm. Specifically, she exposed us grandchildren to
its poets, especially Poe. She could recite /Annabel Lee/ by heart. I
say she was not an educated thinker; nevertheless, she possessed an
instinctual grasp of the Dark Muse as though it was a common thread of
hers and the earlier Victorian generations. Longfellow, the Brownings,
and Whittier were also her favourites, and I can only assume she had
been infected by her mother who was born circa 1870. To be sure, we
are woven from strands reaching back into the past.

I joined the U.S. Army right out of high school in 1974, and in 1975,
at the age of nineteen, after basic training and AIT (Advanced
Individual Training), I received my permanent assignment to West
Germany. My first location was far out on the Bohemian frontier, deep
in the /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Forest][Bavarian Forest]]/ where the Army and Air Force operated a small
mountaintop electronic eavesdropping post near the tiny village of
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimbach,_Upper_Palatinate][Rimbach]].[fn:151] We were less than one hundred Americans "on the
economy," which meant we had no base nor barracks, rather, lived out
amongst the locals. My rooms were with a farmer family in a house just
below the /haunted/ Lichteneck [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burg_Lichteneck_(Oberpfalz)][castle ruins]] overlooking the wild,
forested /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoher_Bogen][Hoher Bogen]]/ ridge.

For the first time in my life I was living in, not just hearing or
reading about the Old World. I'll never forget waking up that first
September morning in Rimbach in the small, country-style /Pension/ the
Army had rented for transient barracks and social events. It was
located in the centre of the tiny village and my window that morning
overlooked the inner courtyard of a neighboring farm where I saw a
wizened old crone out of a fairytale splitting firewood. I then looked
up to the facing hillside and saw a small troop of men wearing what
looked like other-century traditional costumes hand-scything hay and
piling it into a horse-drawn wagon. It was truly the land time had
forgotten.

For the first time in my life I was not plugged into the all-consuming
social-psychology spew of America and its domineering, blighting
Zeitgeist-wrangling media. Everything around me felt old, very old,
the local Bavarians connected to something else, perhaps a fairytale
that was now in suspended animation.[fn:152] And when I was handed a
copy of /Lord of the Rings/ and I first learned of Hobbits and the
Shire, yes, this is the Shire, I thought. As fall turned into winter I
spent every free moment hiking the forested ridge trails. It was as if
time had changed its mechanisms from round, perfect cogs to endlessly
looping Möbius strips. I would work a shift at the high-tech American
site built on the /Hoher Bogen/'s most eastern bump, /Eckstein/, then
reenter the fairytale land all around me. Oh but Nature had a very
dark, old, and serious feel in those environs, while by comparison any
American wilds had a lighter, even merry feel. I almost made it a
daily pilgrimage hiking up to the Lichteneck Ruins, parts of which had
been reconstructed, including the original keep. A legend said a
princess had thrown herself from the original keep to her death and
her ghost supposedly roamed the place after dark. And so the warning
to never be in the woods after dark was taken seriously.

I can remember the odd dark, gothic moments during my Army time in
Germany. Back then, however, I was not keying on Dark, my life simply
experiential. 

*** What Nature means to me now

Fast forward several decades---past my well-lit, rationalist life in
high-tech professions---to find me in the far northeastern corner of
Minnesota, the so-called /North Shore/ of Lake Superior. This is the
very last county, Cook, just before the Canadian border, the very tip
of the so-called "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region][Arrowhead Region]]" to the north and east of
Duluth. Here are some six million-plus acres of wilderness continuing
northward from the coast of the world's largest body of freshwater (by
surface area). To be sure, this can be a very Dark Muse kind of place,
so much so that believe I cannot go, cannot go ... as much as my
fellow humans here frustrate me with their pointedly anti-Dark
attitudes. Pictures may be worth thousands of words, but our Dark vibe
up here must be experienced to be truly appreciated. I routinely get
tiny glimpses of the shadow and magic realm whenever I look out at my
moonlit /Inland Sea/[fn:153] over the treetops of dark spruce and
gnarled, bare aspen. As Haworth Emily means, Nature is
the original Dark.

The /Inland Sea/ or /Mother Superior/, as some call her, is so
much more sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is much
smaller and much---plainer, simpler. The enormity of our Inland Sea
means she is often violent like any sea or ocean of saltwater. No
friendly little puddle for beer-and-brats picnickers, speedboat and
jet ski riffraff is she.[fn:154] To be sure, one senses a mighty
présence on her shores, often dark and moody, if not angry and
malevolent on a stormy night. The lady has /personality/.

Despite our expansive and all but contiguous wildness, despite our
famous chains of Ice Age-glaciated lakes in the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_Waters_Canoe_Area_Wilderness][Boundary Waters Canoe
Area Wilderness]], the Arrowhead is not /spectacular/ in the
stereotypical "American Great Outdoors" sense. Nothing here overwhelms
as with the American West or Alaska with their "natural wonders"
postcard vistas every five feet. As I'm saying, a deep moodiness often
prevails, setting up the Dark Muse subtle to sublime pathway. Sadly,
however, my local community is bereft of Dark Musers.[fn:155] Which
might have a silver lining in that I have a perfect laboratory to test
whether the Dark Muse is nature or nurture. That is to say, if I see
no past-century architecture,[fn:156] if I have no like-minded
community to mutually re-enforce nighttime proclivities, then any Dark
musing must come from the actual place itself, hence, nature over
nurture, right?

But I do believe I am here quite alone with my Dark musings. Despite
Grand Marais counting only some thirteen hundred permanent residents,
we are becoming evermore modern urban/suburban in behavior and
mentality. Why? Mainly due to our popularity as a Northern Midwest
resort town. Tourists of short-, medium-, and long-stay duration,
well-off retirees, and especially all the relocating urban-suburban
refugees constantly mix up and dilute this community. And these
newcomers are tipping the balance away from any sort of small-town
ambience; instead, they bring and maintain their aloof, disengaged,
blinkered, emotionally and intellectually unavailable urban-suburban
ways. Of course "boosters," the knee-jerk positive promoters and spin
doctors, will always disagree with my assessment; but many
"old-timers" agree that it ain't what it used to be. Alas.

A particular North Shore social-psychological phenomenon is the large
numbers of people who relocate here from the Midwestern urban
city-states, e.g., Chicago or especially the Twin Cities, ostensibly
to /reinvent/ themselves. Of course tourist destinations traffic in
short-exposure vibe and fantasy, but here is a very unique sort of
expectancy build-up. My theory has it that our newcomers have made
their one great leap out of the sterile, soulless clone-bunny
urban/suburban scene with the intent of becoming some better, more
/authentic/ version of themselves in the wilderness. The most dominant
North Shore reinvention /lifestyle/ is loosely based around a
Hemingway and Jack London ethos, i.e., the macho, gonzo, adventurer
takes on the Great Outdoors, something I call /Neo-Klondikism/. Of
course the real white European North Shore pioneers of the
late-nineteenth, early-twentieth centuries were mainly of Scandinavian
origin and brought their admixture of Scandi and Victorian
civilization to the wilderness, but of course none of that remains,
except at the Historical Society's museum. Today we see /Outside/
magazine acteurs, college-grad back-to-the-lander nouveau hillbilly
peasant chic, with their tattoos, huge beards, Carhartt and Pendelton
duds, driving Jeep Cherokees, their theme music a faux country-western
Appalachian---in other words, an impromptu guerrilla theatre of some
slice of the American Zeitgeist churn.

But then what are we supposed to be doing up here? Thousands upon
thousands of tourists spend their vacation time and money here. If I'm
getting Dark vibes, I won't pretend to know what they are getting out
of this place.[fn:157] Many decide to be here permanently, and, thus,
begin their North Shore lives of expectation---that their childhood
memories of singing Kumbaya around the campfire and the general
vacation magic become 24/7.

Grand Marais is the home of the [[https://northhouse.org/][North House Folk School]], where the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement][Arts and Crafts Movement]] meets the Scandinavian /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_high_school][Folk school]]/. Early
in the summer they hold their annual [[https://www.northhouse.org/events/wooden-boat-show?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwhb60BhClARIsABGGtw85B1_ja5XEfwK8z67xLIluZlvh8rzvshmO0ke1XdO84iJQRGChyCsaAqqfEALw_wcB][Wooden Boat Show]] where
non-powered, legacy wooden boats---many built on-site---are on
display, subsequently sailed and oared about our Grand Marais
harbour. To be sure, many of these designs are based on the crafts
used by the Norwegian immigrant fishermen of the late nineteenth,
early-twentieth century along our Lake Superior coast. But during this
summer's event all the happy boating was disrupted when a hooligan on
a "personal watercraft," aka jet ski, ripped around the harbour,
throwing wake after wake at the floating participants. I've thought
about this quite a bit, about how these visiting "educated elites"
from the Twin Cities were mocked by the yokel descendent of
Scandinavian peasant loggers and fishermen. And so in the twenty-first
century we have one derivative /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality][hyperreality]]/ attacking
another. Wikipedia defines hyperreality thusly

#+begin_quote
Hyperreality is a concept that refers to the process of the
evolution of notions of reality, leading to a cultural state of
confusion between signs and symbols invented to stand in for reality,
and direct perceptions of consensus reality ... Hyperreality tricks
consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement,
instead opting for artificial simulation, and endless reproductions of
fundamentally empty appearance... *Fulfillment or happiness is found
through simulation and imitation of a transient simulacrum (an
insubstantial, unsatisfactory imitation) of reality, rather than any
interaction with any "real" reality.
#+end_quote

A working definition of hyperreality has often simply been "porn." And
so I wonder what are these idealist, progressive college-gradders
hoping to experience with their brief proximity to traditional,
human-powered boats? But then what would the hooligan from his world
of NASCAR, "contemporary" country music, and cheap American beer hope
to achieve with his little protest action? Are we all just lost in
these endless opaque labyrinths of recursive symbols, stand-ins, and
derivative hyperreality? What is porn and what is real? Yes, indeed,
this is the North Shore resort town theatre I experience daily.

Dare I say outright nobody gets this place, or that I do and they
don't? And yet there is a tacit understanding that here is not really
dazzling striking amazing. This is a lower-key for sure. Wealthy
people are here; but this is certainly not the ostentatious, celebrity
scene like Jackson Hole, Wyoming, nor dynastic "old money" like
Newport, Rhode Island. No, we're not in that league.[fn:158] A
memorable advertisement poster for Arrowhead tourism showed a twilit
Boundary Waters wilderness lake with the tagline "Stirred not
shaken."[fn:159] I'm sure many do have Dark Muse moments, but simply
lack the cultural background to process (embellish?) and identify them
as such. For example, our so-called Northern Lights give pause, are
beloved by all, thus, Night gets a probational capitalisation

Here's a few lines I once wrote some twenty years ago after a
late-autumn hike

#+begin_quote
Mists race westward through the surrounding spruce forest, enveloping
the entire ridge. The light is quickly failing, the Western
Hemisphere’s greatest inland sea just four miles south and seven
hundred feet below fully obscured. Sleet begins to fall stinging my
face, keeping my eyes from fully focusing. Though I hear the wind
through the coated trees, the distant sound of the invisible waves
crashing angrily against the rocks, land's staunch defenders.

I have come the four miles up from the town, up the wet, slippery
trail, up through the darkening forest, to pay homage to this late
autumn wonderland. I, modern human, wear a Gore-Tex jacket over a
Merino wool top over a silk base layer. I wear running tights and
padded biking gloves. I wear special minimalist running shoes to
simulate barefoot running. So dressed I am out to face the age-old
elements.

Not a soul as I climb the darkening trail. I pause at the ridge’s two
main streams to take in their loud and clear coursing from all the new
precipitation. I should walk rather than run. But visibility is going
fast and I must reach the ridge top ere dusk.

Fittingly anti-climatic is my arrival at the cloud-bound ridge
top. All but evening's darkness when I set off again for home. The
snow is now accumulating in earnest, making downhill footing
difficult. But the Muse is strong, and the growing twilight and
pooling blackness make it all the stronger.
#+end_quote

Throughout my wonderful hikes in these wild, dark places I greatly
appreciate the natural beauty. But always lingering are existential
doubts, mainly in the form of my undeniable separation from nature,
again, that huge modern gradient between indoors and outdoors, that
constant calling of our divorced partner. If I said /our growing
separation from nature runs parallel to our growing separation from
one another/, I wouldn't be saying much new. People today waddling
about in their /fantasy silos/, extremely sensitive to any challenges
of their illusions, their hyperreality stack. I sense we're in the
midst of a great unmooring, and I feel a growing dysphoria. It was
darkening round me on that magical Halloween evening, as well as on
that misty, sleeting evening. But what can I keep of those experiences
when I come back inside?

As so often before and since, I finished my lonely, silent, inclement
ridge-top visitation and left Nature to return to my cocooned human
existence. So there I sat in my modern apartment drinking my protein
shake and wondering what it all meant. Those particular lines were
written before I had really latched onto the Dark Muse. Now things are
much more firmly formed and I'm following a more intentional path
vis-à-vis Dark. And yet clarity, direction, purpose are a fleeting as
ever---though what is Dark to me is interwoven with what is Nature to
me. Maybe I should just try for more mysticism as did my
nineteenth-century principals. Here again is Haworth Emily

#+begin_verse
I’m happiest when most away
I can bear my soul from its home of clay
On a windy night when the moon is bright
And the eye can wander through worlds of light ---
When I am not and none beside ---
Nor earth nor sea nor cloudless sky ---
But only spirit wandering wide
Through infinite immensity.
#+end_verse

And here's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron][Byron]][fn:160]

#+begin_verse
I live not in myself, but I become				
Portion of that around me; and to me
High mountains are a feeling, but the hum
Of human cities torture: I can see
Nothing to loathe in nature, save to be
A link reluctant in a fleshy chain,
Class’d among creatures, when the soul can flee,
And with the sky, the peak, the heaving plain
Of ocean, or the stars, mingle, and not in vain.
#+end_verse

When I'm in Nature I can feel /something/---even realising I'm a
barely tolerated out to despised orphan prodigal juggling my own
special hyperrealities. But invariably when I return to civilisation I
always feel somewhat crash-landed. If the Marine drill sergeant said
to the recruit struggling to do push-ups, /pain is weakness leaving
the body,/ then depression is illusion leaving the mind. I would blame
myself even louder if not for the fact that so many, many people can
relate to this pervasive emptiness. Longing, yearning might be all I
can ever do amidst infirmities, weakness, corruption, depression
... once more Haworth Emily

#+begin_verse
...'Twas grief enough to think mankind
All hollow, servile, insincere ---
But worse to trust to my own mind
And find the same corruption there

In closing, I doubt Grand Marais will ever be my sepulchre by the
sea. I may eventually move on to where the cemeteries are bigger, the
buildings older, the people more openly darkly-inclined. Or just find,
wherever they may be, a niche amongst those who acknowledge there can
be a darkness in the day and a lightness arriving at twilight.[fn:161]
But here is so much of Nature if I will keep after her. And in so
chasing Nature, I in my own modern-era way embrace the "dark half" as
well, deterioration and Death. Brightness, darkness. The sun
shines. The clouds hide the sun. The moon shines. The clouds hide the
moon. Light and its play pull at me. The seasons turn eternally
emphasizing cycles over clocks---that too. Lost and found and lost
again is a basic cycle as well. But at the end of the day my Dark Muse
remains mouldering, smoldering, waiting, waiting for something. But
for now at least I cannot go, I cannot go.

#+INCLUDE: "./footer.org" :minlevel 1

* Footnotes

[fn:1] /muse/: Originally any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts; /or/ a state of
deep thought or abstraction, e.g., to enter a /muse/ over a poem; /or/
a source of inspiration, e.g., /Jane Austen is my muse/.

[fn:2] ...e.g., Lady Dedlock's death at the graveyard of her secret
lover in Dickens' /Bleak House/. \\
[[file:images/BleakHouseCemetery.png]] \\
\\

[fn:3] The word /moor/ appears forty-three times in /Jane Eyre/. After
the second or third use, I was just putty in Charlotte's hands...

[fn:4] ...or by modern, well-off tourists.

[fn:5] ...the first half in Southern Illinois.

[fn:6] ...more than double the next most popular, the Grand Canyon...

[fn:7] Perhaps give the Smokies a second chance by reading the
pre-park fictional work /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_(novel)][Christy]]/ by Catherine Marshall. She captures
something that might be called /Appalachian Gothic/.

[fn:8] Allow me the poetic emphasis device of capitalising nouns.

[fn:9] Quick preliminary, much more later: The term Romanticism
followed a twisted path beginning with the Latin /romant/, or, "in the
Roman manner", thus, not at all our current use of the word as a
synonym of lovey-dovey stuff. In general, bundling what I'm trying to
get at as /Romanticism/ is fraught to say the least. Academe wants to
grip butterflies, but when they open their hands there is only
goo. Lots more on this problem as we go...

[fn:10] Yes, ironic that I'm trying to be logical analytical here, no?

[fn:11] ...goth described [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture][here]] by Wikipedia as well as anywhere. \\
[[file:images/RyderBeetlejuice.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:12] By the way, the Germans capitalise nouns, i.e., built-in
poetic emphasis.

[fn:13] ...and then the normies haul out their DSM-5s (/Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders/) and pigeonhole us as
abnormal.

[fn:14] Yes, MHGA: Make Halloween Great Again \\
[[file:images/Santos-Halloween-regular-Diamond.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:15] More about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard][Jean Baudrillard]] and his theories of simulacra and
hyperreality later. But for now, yes, Dark too often suffers from
hyper-Dark treatments.

[fn:16] ... for example, due to the Victorian shadow thrown over my
childhood especially by my grandmother?

[fn:17] Look [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB][here]] for a quick biography.  \\

\\

[fn:18] The appallingly high percentages of people these days on
prescription psychopharmacology drugs or /pyscho-pharma/, "happy
pills," is proof of what I'm saying. Happy and sad cannot, should not
be controlled chemically.

[fn:19] See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Rossetti][here]] for a bio. She is considered by many Britain's
most prolific poet. \\
[[file:images/RossettiAge16.jpg]] \\

[fn:20] Go [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow][here]] for a quick biography. HWL was not typically Dark,
rather, a popular, "uplifting" poet with a big audience. That's what
makes this selection so unique for me.

[fn:21] Below, we will go over Romanticism poetising's originator,
Novalis. Much to say about poetising, Novalis, and Romanticism...

[fn:22] ...more about storytelling below...

[fn:23] A side question may be, Why in such bounteous, prosperous,
easy times as our today are so many people not thriving, rather, only
barely surviving---mainly due to psychological infirmaries?  More on
the false gospel of thrive, thrive, thrive!  later...

[fn:24] /modus vivendi/: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, /or/ (literally) a way of living.

[fn:25] /Fazit/: n; in conclusion, in summary, all in all; Germanized
Latin for /it follows/.

[fn:26]  See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson][here]] for a quick biography. \\
[[file:images/EmilyDickinson2.jpg]]
\\
\\

[fn:27] Where has our human network gone? Something tells me getting
pity responses to a YouTube comment isn't the same...

[fn:28] Doom as unforeseen consequences of previous actions, which in
turn, entropically snowball into indebtedness, tragedy, and ruin;
typically multi-generational, a punishment that never seems to fit the
original crime---if it was a crime at all. One German word for doom is
/Untergang/, which also means /downfall/.

[fn:29] Queen Victoria in mourning black ca. 1862. \\
[[file:images/QueenVictoriaInMourningBlack.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:30] Is there anything worse than the so-called /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief][five stages of
grief]]/ or the Kübler-Ross model? Grief as an emotional malfunction
to be systematically reduced, fixed, corrected? Alas.

[fn:31] Not out yet. Coming...

[fn:32] In the third line, /Heft/ means weight, heaviness; importance,
influence; /or/ (archaic) the greater part or bulk of something.

[fn:33] Dickinson freely employed the capitalising of nouns for poetic
emphasis.

[fn:34] Again, my shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson is
based on their earthly locations---Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the
former and Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.

[fn:35] Is it not ironic how nearly all lifeforms that attempt to
share our modern human environments uninvited are considered invasive,
noxious vermin, pests to which we have developed almost hysterical
revulsion?

[fn:36] Though /cotton/ was rapidly becoming a global commodity, both
cotton and wool fabrics eventually being produced in steam-powered
factories as the Industrial Age reached its inflexion point of growth.

[fn:37] In any modern (non-organic Amazon Whole Foods-style) chain
supermarket I'm sure less that 1% of the food items come from a truly
local source. Nearly everything is shipped in from often far afar.

[fn:38] ...e.g., what is a flower garden but a derivative, a mock-up
of an original place out in the wilds, albeit with the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits left, weeded out?
Again, this is Baudrillard's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality][hyperreality]], which we'll discuss below.

[fn:39] How often is a Shakespeare character out communing with
nature? Never?...

[fn:40] Churches were typically built in the centre of a town or city
on the highest ground. I once heard that to this day no building in
Vienna may be built taller than the tower of St. Stephen's Cathedral.

[fn:41] Skyline of Orbit City from /The Jetsons/ cartoon sitcom

[fn:42] Human population grew 60% between 1800 and 1900, and /275%/
between 1900 and 2000.

[fn:43] Modern human narratives come at us as thousands upon thousands
of fictional novels, films, plays, while aboriginal peoples had myth
and legends timeless and unchanging. That alone...

[fn:44] Is our relatively gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog][boiling frog]] metaphor?

[fn:45] What became of Wordsworth's /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45560/to-a-highland-girl][To a Highland Girl]]/ shepherdess
when she and her family were forced into an industrial urban slum? We
can only hope she and her kin are in a better place now...

[fn:46] ...which we will explore again below...

[fn:47] In those days wild, untouched places were often referred to as
wastelands.

[fn:48] Where I live (the Arrowhead region of Northeast Minnesota) we
have two major bike races of over one hundred miles through our
wilderness. Is this some sacrificial, ceremonial ritual to nature?
Indeed, much of our "outdoor activities" here involve hardship and
discomfort in a sort of "rite of passage" way.

[fn:49] What is generally acknowledged as a clear breakthrough was
John Snow's tracing of the London cholera outbreak of 1854 back to
certain London neighborhood public wells. This was strong proof of
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease][contagion theory]]. However, it wasn't until the late nineteenth
century that Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur established the field of
bacteriology and our modern scientific understanding of microscopic
pathogens finally developed.

[fn:50] Couple this modern mechanistic "death as malfunction" with
atheist nihilism to arrive at today's soulless mechanical universe
realism dumpster fire.

[fn:51] For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are---outside of war and homicidal aggression---all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.

[fn:52] Gillian Welch nod.

[fn:53] Consider [[https://youtu.be/PnjFu9CPwlQ?si=FRnqDZZXh5TAcvfG][this quite tolerable goth version]] of the classic rock
song. Had this been written in Brontëan times, it would have been no
cheap, sentimental gimmickry.

[fn:54] Consider the now commonplace heart pacemaker, a device that
literally overrides the human heart with artificial electronic
pulses. Also, hip and knee replacements are now routine. And this, we
are promised, is only the beginning. Some have called this
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism][transhumanism]]/.

[fn:55] Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.

[fn:56] Anne Brontë's grave in Scarborough \\

[fn:57] Perhaps watch [[https://youtu.be/_yzBEP3Qyvc?si=QBkrGikYxWP7C9eN][this]] on Anne's last days in Scarborough.

[[file:images/Novalis-1.jpg]] \\
This is the only known picture of Novalis, found at the family estate,
then later identified by Ludwig Tieck---meaning it might actually be a
brother of Novalis'...

[fn:60] Coleridge and Wordsworth's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrical_Ballads][Lyrical Ballads]]/, first edition
appearing in 1798.

[fn:61] Started ca. 1797, finally published in 1800. The German
/Hymnen/ (plural of /Hymne/) means "praising songs"
(/Lobgesang)/. Allow me the abbreviation /HttN/ from here on. Try
[[https://www.george-macdonald.com/etexts/hymns_to_night.html][this
George MacDonald translation]] as found in a publication from 1897.

[fn:62] ...referred to as the /Jena Set/ by Andrea Wulf in her
/Magnificent Rebels, The First Romantics and the Invention of the
Self/ by Andrea Wulf; 2022; Vintage Books. More about this flawed
account in a section below.

[fn:63] See the Wikipedia explanation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism][Romanticism]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Romanticism][German
Romanticism]] ... but with a grain of salt. As I repeat throughout, one
of the main objectives of WutheringUK is to wrest Romanticism and
especially Dark away from the ivory tower humanities "scholars."

[fn:64] The German /Poesie/ is typically translated as simply
/poetry/; however, poetry as a concept beyond just the literary art,
more towards the older /poesy/ perhaps.

[fn:65] If you must, read [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/novalis/][this about Novalis]], which is as good as
any. But as academe is wont to do, it hangs on every word uttered and
written by a young man in his twenties feeling his way along. This
approach may work with Bohr and Einstein, but not with a
twenty-something poet...

[fn:66] Lots more on eighteenth-century English Gothic below.

[fn:67] And yet /HttN/ wasn't entirely new after all. Soon will be
discussed similar offerings from the eighteenth century.

[fn:77] Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven't noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats' primary food sources.

[fn:78] ...a stay in Belgium to learn French and a short-lived gig in
nearby Halifax as a governess.

[fn:79] Sadly enough, there is nothing really otherworldly Dark or
Romanticist as I know it about Jane Austen. She was seemingly devoid,
non-pursuant of Dostoyevski's POEH. Although she once did say,
"Pictures of perfection, as you know, make me sick and wicked."
(Letter to her niece Fanny Knight, 23 March 1817.) Otherwise, we know
nothing of any dark inclinations she might have had.

[fn:80] From my 1853 copy \\
[[file:images/NightThoughtsBook2.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:81]  YMMV. Personally, I like a good doom-and-gloom session, and
Young really delivers with /Night Thoughts/. Later we'll go into Emily
Brontë's take on doom-and-gloom and her more measured Christian
perspective.

[fn:82] ...that is, in a past age not exposed to the science of modern
public relations. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays][this]] about Edward Bernays and the birth of
modern advertising and public relations. TL;DR: Since Bernays, no
"movement" in our modern times can be considered natural and organic,
rather, the result of somebody's financed public relations campaign.

[fn:83] ...but the Germans were not idle during this time, either. I
should also mention Gottfried August Bürger's very popular and often
translated into English epic poem /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenore_(ballad)][Lenore]]/ from 1774.

[fn:84] /Das Land der Dichter und Denker/. Intentionally absent was
novelists. Although now novelists count as part of /die Belletristik/,
i.e., /schöngeistige Literatur/ or aesthetic literature.

[fn:85] Two terms, /novel/ (English) and /roman/ (French, German,
etc. from the adjectival /Roman/, /Roman-like/) came to describe any
long-form prose story-telling.

[fn:86] Ironically, the /Novella/, a long short-story format with no
chapter breaks, was better tolerated in Germany.

[fn:87] One giveaway is /gothic/ in the title. Perhaps read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction][this
overview]] of Gothic fiction.

[fn:88] Walpole initially claimed /Otranto/ to be a medieval
manuscript he had discovered and translated, when all along it had
been his own creation.

[fn:90] Hitchcock was once asked why he thought his horror films were
so popular. He replied, "From time to time the man on the street likes
to dip his toe in the lake of horror."

[fn:91] See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_(prose_fiction)][this]] sorting out.

[fn:92] Once asked why his horror films were so popular, Alfred
Hitchcock said the man on the street likes to occasionally dip his toe
in the lake of horror.

[fn:93] My former wife, a Jane Austen fan, read /Wuthering Heights/
and advised me to skip it. I always trusted her literary advice and,
thus, have never read it.

[fn:94] ...although Wordsworth would later mention Barbauld and
/ASEM/ as inspirational.

[fn:95] We'll talk about /liminality/ soon...

[fn:96]  The Jena Set's Friedrich Schlegel first used /romantic/ in
contrast to /classic/ to describe what they in Jena were supposedly
starting. But it wasn't until the 1820s when the term Romanticism
became widely known and used---evermore randomly...

[fn:97] A quote from M.H. Abrams' laborious /The Mirror and the Lamp/
would insist ... /even an aesthetic philosophy so abstract and
seemingly academic as that of Kant can be shown to have modified the
work of poets./ Really? I doubt the Brontë sisters read much Kant. But
then Abrams never even mentions the Brontës...

[fn:98] Peruse on YouTube under /The Romantics: [[https://youtu.be/oLwRXlSgiSQ?si=y4a1MQek8Ac0pkyJ][Liberty]], [[https://youtu.be/liVQ21KZfOI?si=GpsPOUfS_l6w6r8_][Nature]],
[[https://youtu.be/R6mefXs5h9o?si=c-cJk0fKTneunPZH][Eternity]]/ at your peril.

[fn:99] Notably absent is *Romanticism = Dark*...

[fn:100] From the outset, the Schlegels in Jena made Shakespeare a
principal proto-Romanticist, Ludwig Tieck and others of the Jena Set
feverishly translating his plays into German. For me this was a clear
sign they were on the wrong road. I will at some future date have my
fictional character from my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ tell you why.

[fn:101] So convenient for modern experts that Jena Romanticism came
about in a for its time free-wheeling university town, many of the
Jena Set also lecturers and professors at the University of
Jena. Perhaps a modern version would have been [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mountain_College][Black Mountain College]].

[fn:102]  Sample perhaps [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIffazJIrLo&list=PLhP9EhPApKE_9uxkmfSIt2JJK6oKbXmd-&pp=iAQB][Isaiah Berlin's 1965 lectures on Romanticism]],
published later in book form as /The Roots of Romanticism/.

[fn:103] ...my italics...

[fn:104] Contrast with E.T.A. Hoffmann's very gothic and sinister /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(short_story)][The
Sandman]]/ appeared in 1817 dealing with an all-too-human mechanical
automaton.

[fn:105] More about /pathetic fallacy/ soon.

[fn:106] ...due to ignorance of Novalis? Alas...

[fn:107] ...and again there is certainly no inkling of what I spoke of
above about the modern indoor-outdoor dichotomy.

[fn:108] One observer called this modern tendency to appropriate
Eastern religion along with animist aboriginal shamanism "spiritual
grandiosity."

[fn:109] ...they always trot out Byron for *Romanticism = sensual*.

[fn:110] In 1810 he published /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guide_to_the_Lakes][Guide to the Lakes]]/, which kicked off
Lake District tourism fever in earnest. Rail access began in 1846
and 1847.

[fn:112] ...named in 1843.

[fn:113] /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_homini_lupus][Man is a wolf to man]]/.

[fn:114] Some might call Marx's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Condition_of_the_Working_Class_in_England][The Condition of the Working Class in
England]] published in 1845 the beginning of Marxism.

[fn:115] [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_mediatisation][German mediatisation]] brought on by Napoleonic conquest of the
so-called Germanic /Holy Roman Empire/ reduced, secularlised, and
consolidated the German states from 300 down to 39.

[fn:116] Friedrich's enigmatic /Der Chasseur im Walde/, 1814 \\
[[file:images/FriedrichLostFrenchSoldier.png]] \\
\\

[fn:117] Oddly enough, the Brontës are completely left out of many key
academic analyses of Romanticism. For example, Abrams' /The Mirror and
the Lamp/, Beach's /The Concept of Nature in Nineteenth-Century
English Poetry/, and Berlin's /The Roots of Romanticism/ make no
mention of them! Maybe they had read [[https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Bronte-upload-4.pdf][Virginia Woolf's comments on
/Jane Eyre/]] and had given up the B-Sisters for a bad job. See [[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/19/virginia-woolf-in-bronte-country-jane-eyre][this
analysis]] as well. Big cringe. More soon...

[fn:120] *Nostalgia*, from Latin, literally means /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homesickness][homesickness]]/ and

[fn:122] Luke 12:48: /For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall
be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him they

[fn:123] Again, the Romantic Era is typically fenced between the years
1800 and 1850.

[fn:124] ...e.g., the Brontës were pastor's daughters in rural West
Yorkshire with little exposure to (taint from?) the cultural and
literary buzz of the cities.

[fn:125] Again, today we have the concept of left-brain, right-brain,
as often enough nothing else can describe this split-personality
confusion. The best ideas about left-right brain are those of Iain
McGilchrist. Try [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK7XG3t2nFg&list=PLqBHk3itxyPDKFnwj8-SmlwHra64cCrky&pp=iAQB][these]].

[fn:126] [[https://engines.egr.uh.edu/english-romanticism/what-romanticism][This]] will save you some googling. Again, note especially the
tortured, left-brained origin of the term /romantic/.

[fn:127] For what it's worth, German Romanticism can be broken down
into Jena, Heidelberg, then Berlin Romanticism based largely on the
principle artists.

[fn:128] Again, Goethe would criticise Romanticism harshly, but
attempted to bridge proto-Romanticm /Sturm und Drang/ with his new
classicism.

\\

[fn:131] Academe is also wont to play around with Freud's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive][death drive]]
(/Todestrieb/), another red herring completely antithetical to
everything I'm about here with WutheringUK. If anyone didn't get
feelings and poetisation as my principals saw it, that would be
Sigmund Freud.

[fn:132] ...a blessing perhaps?

[fn:133] Let me finally mention here that the word /wuthering/ is
"Northern" dialect for the wind blowing; from late Middle English
/whither/, /wuther/ "rush, make a rushing sound", probably of
Scandinavian origin; or /whithering/ comes from the Old Norse and
means roaring like the wind on a stormy day. This is the sort of
/wuthering/ I'm using in my title /WutheringUK/, i.e., I'm not
referencing the book.

[fn:134] /Gestalt/ in the sense of form, pattern,
configuration. Perhaps as well legends are comprised of /atoms/ of
legend stuff, etc. More on "legend receptor sites" later.

[fn:135] Case in point is Goethe's /The Sorrows of Young Werther/
(first print 1774) which supposedly unleashed a wave of suicides of
young men who identified all too closely with the story's male
protagonist who commits suicide after losing at love.

[fn:136] ...forcefully, poking me in the chest with his finger!

[fn:137] Compare perhaps with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mircea_Eliade#Philosophy][Mircea Eliade]] "terror of history"
concept where, literally, the linear progression of time and history
is meaningless when compared to the mythical sacred times of
origin. In effect, mundane life is meaningless, thus, its accumulation
of "events" are also meaningless, even oppressive destructive for
those still trapped in linear time and a strictly mundane
interpretation of life and reality.
