** To begin

Light snow drifts gently down from low clouds draped over a misty
boreal forest. Deer in their grey winter coats process through the fir
and spruce. Ravens and crows dolefully croak and caw back and
forth. And I burn a daytime candle. Such an ambience to convey my
thoughts, my impressions and /feelings/ about my /Dark Muse/.[fn:1]

Do you have a strange fascination for things on the gloomy side? You
often find dreamy what others find dreary ... like when an overcast
day brings on a strangely sanguine melancholy ... or a stormy night is
magnificent in a frightening and thrilling sort of way. Twilight is a
welcome reprieve from the hectic day, freeing your senses, deepening
your thoughts. Unnatural is getting out of heat into air conditioning
and drinking iced beverages; however, it is so nice to come inside out
of the cold and sit by a fire and drink hot tea... Perhaps you've
paused to gaze transfixed upon an old, abandoned cemetery, or a
lonely, nondescript landscape. A decaying, overgrown other-century
dwelling makes you envious of the bats living there. Though panic and
nausea well up when those around you are attempting to impose
happy-clappy, sunny-cheery; generally, what is uplifting to them is
piteously trite out to ruefully wretched to you. Your heroes learned
and grew facing grim and harsh---and if they succumbed to the
thrashing, amen, RIP...[fn:2] You prefer candlelight over artificial
light, old architecture over new, the genial disorder of wild nature
over the forced order of gardens. If in a city, you gravitate to the
"old town." What is spectacular to them is suspect and eventually
disappointing to you ... whereas things subtle, veiled, shadowy
tenuous, understated are intriguing. Stirrings, please, not shaking or
slamming... And wouldn't it be grand if every month (or week!) we
celebrated Halloween? If yes to any of this, you might understand what
I'm trying to say here.

We are loathe to explain our dark /penchant/ to those who don't,
can't, won't get it. As it were, the Dark Muse must flee any sort of
logical or rational packaging. Dark as I mean it was best presented by
certain principle *poets* of the early nineteenth-century Romantic
Era[fn:3], an emergent property, a very special private corner of this
ultimately maligned and misunderstood time. And best is the Dark Muse
in poetry, for if we put something to lyrical poetry we have captured
more and drove deeper than had we described with prose. I can only say
my Dark Muse often comes on as a /feeling behind feeling/, subtle,
profound, yet fleeting, not hanging around for pedantics'
descriptions.[fn:4] Dark stirrings arrive mostly unannounced, a
veritable surprise. And so this essay will rely heavily on the poetry
of the preeminent Romantic Era champions of Dark Muse.[fn:5]

** Adding an extra wagon to the goth train

Of course I have an affinity with and feel a kinship to the modern
goth subculture.[fn:6] And yet it is one of the elephants I must shift
from the centre of the room. In very short, I believe modern goths
surely /sense/ Dark[fn:7], but for whatever reasons only want to
express it, explore it very narrowly through goth music and
fashion. My Dark Muse would hopefully include, be akin to what is
today called goth and gothic, /but I must go deeper and more
elemental/. I hope it's obvious by now that I want to speak to your
"inner goth."

There is a /natural darkness/ nature provides, a basis upon which we
may create symbols, artefacts, icons, trappings to emulate, decorate,
magnify, socialise, humanise, /bring indoors/ natural Dark. Yes to
aesthetics as far as they may resonate, do honour to Dark. But too
often our human take on Dark arrives overstated, overwrought---all the
way out to grimy, ignoble, silly, scummy. We imbibe then express what
we see, experience, feel, but it should be done carefully, if not
respectfully. And so I must reject so many of the overdone /gothic/
horror fright memes, e.g., vampires, witches, demons; mean, nasty,
menacing this, campy, threatening, evil that. Right up front: My Dark
is not meant to shock or frighten, rather, invite, deepen, and
enrich. My Dark Muse contains nothing cruel nor evil nor sinister nor
satanic[fn:8]. Not the /Star Wars/ "dark side," not dark barbarism à
la /Heart of Darkness/, and not the psychic dark described by Freud or
Jung. I cringe when someone says, "...and then things took a /dark/
turn." In general

\begin{align*}
\Large{\text{Dark} \ne \text{negative}}
\end{align*}

Or course they're all interesting, and yes, over-the-top can be fun,
but I'd rather not lose sight of the source, however obscure and
difficult. I'm after something more subtle, discriminating, and
inward-personal. *My Dark is about the sublime,*[fn:9] sublimity being
the next step beyond beauty into Dostoevsky's POEH. And so I hearken
back to a golden era when Dark was the cultural currency, to be sure,
the early nineteenth century, a time when my key poets, my
/principals/ (e.g. Poe, Novalis, the Brontës) showed us how triste and
Stygian can be so very subtle and sublime. I'm after something /I will
not outgrow/, rather, continue as my raison d'être sustaining me to my
grave. And so I say there must be no "aging out of the scene" as I
fear often happens with modern goth. Rather, the Dark Muse should be a
deepening and widening and transcendence for one's entire life.

*** Good English, please

Another ox gored is my rejection of modern dumbed-down American street
English, which has permeated modern society virtually
worldwide. Basically, I mean to sound more erudite, sophisticated,
intellectual with my use of past-century British-tinted English. Why?
Simply because the English of the early-nineteenth century was like a
thoroughbred race horse, sleek and powerful, capable of amazingly deep
and magical expression. Contrast this with beggared, destitute,
impoverished modern American street English, which requires a buy-in
to a particularly base, ignorant, crude and aggressive hipster
Zeitgeist. Which I repudiate, not going there. Although I'm sure I'll
occasionally slip up.

Back in the day, people were more genteel, thoughtful,
fine-spoken. Indeed, back when having character and honour, when
showing decorum and graciousness was a way of life. As a result, their
poetry could express the depths and heights of human thought and
sensitivities so much better.[fn:10] In past centuries they understood
the human need for holiness, grandeur, the epic and eternal. Compare
this with the crypto-rebel posers we see everywhere today who believe
being coarse, crass, base, irreverent---and arrogantly in-your-face
about it---is somehow progressive and desirable...

But on the other hand, it might just be that I've finally succumbed to
the influence of all those schoolmarms back in my distant 1950s-60s
childhood who made us read, e.g., Shakespeare and Hawthorn, those
nearing-retirement throw-backs who held up "wordy," other-century
English as superior. Mrs Mugwortlawny was right, you know. And yes,
I'll occasionally drop foreign as well as Latin words and phrases, my
foreign language being German. You have been warned...

** Dark like me?

For me life seems empty, insipid, weak, every moment rudderless and
misspent without a strong current of the Dark Muse. It's as if life
cannot be properly understood without the dark perspective. *But is
this nature or nurture*? That is to say, am I innately so, or is this
something acculturated?[fn:11] I /feel/ it's the former, especially
given my intro-questionnaire above. Once simply /feels/ the tug of
Dark---regardless of any sort of prepping or grooming. But let's do
another quick litmus test. I present here a short, simple poem from my
main darkness benefactress, the poetess who stands at the centre of
everything I mean to say about dark, namely, Emily Jane Brontë[fn:12]

#+begin_verse
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse

Here EB is direct, blunt even. But now we know. Either she speaks to
something in you, or you are part of the majority who finds
it---weird, abnormal, morbid, overwrought, puerile, even sick or
evil. To be sure, my dark /penchant/ gets mostly deer-in-headlights
responses, if not outright hostility. The openly hostile see my dark
druthers as morose, morbid, as wallowing in self-pity, dwelling on
the negative, in need of a quick DSM–5 look-up. I beg to differ...

Here is something a bit lighter but the same basic idea from
/Christina Rossetti/ [fn:13]

#+begin_verse
Fade tender lily,
Fade O crimson rose,
Fade every flower
Sweetest flower that blows.

Go chilly Autumn,
Come O Winter cold;
Let the green things die away
Into common mould.

Birth follows hard on death,
Life on withering:
Hasten, we shall come the sooner
Back to pleasant Spring.
#+end_verse

Rossetti exposits a dark fatalism, ending with hope bound in humble
expectancy. I like to think these two English poetesses are expressing
an informed, matured melancholy that bespeaks a deeper understanding
of life.

And another poem,[fn:14] here Longfellow's /Snow-flakes/ from a
collection published in 1863

#+begin_verse
Out of the bosom of the Air,
      Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,
Over the woodlands brown and bare,
      Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
            Silent, and soft, and slow
            Descends the snow.

Even as our cloudy fancies take
      Suddenly shape in some divine expression,
Even as the troubled heart doth make
      In the white countenance confession,
            The troubled sky reveals
            The grief it feels.

This is the poem of the air,
      Slowly in silent syllables recorded;
This is the secret of despair,
      Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,
            Now whispered and revealed
            To wood and field.
#+end_verse

Here I see Longfellow[fn:15] looking to the natural world and
/poetising/, to be sure, /darkly/. The idea of poetising, the
/poetisation/ of nature and life was central to the Romantic
Movement. It parallels the long-standing belief that we humans explain
ourselves through, embed our lives in narratives. And to be sure, in
olden times nature was the stage. And so, agents of mental affliction
and depression---despair, grief, misery---are transformed into more
equanimous states of sadness and melancholy, hopefully reaching a
higher emotional maturity. In some paradoxical way, nature and
darkness eventually become healers ... as if the initial agony and
sorrow are a ravaging cancer or virus that eventually fades into
remission, but can never entirely be eliminated whilst on Earth.

This /poetising/ of nature dark and mystical was the modus operandi of
my select nineteenth-century poets[fn:16]. Rather than avoid, they
encountered, /embraced/ the dark, something we today in our
brightly-lit, cordoned-off world might consider counter-intuitive, if
not wrong-headed. I contend we have lost this subtle art of moving
hardship, tragedy, emotional crises into a stasis remission
melancholy. Too often we are failures at finding a /modus
vivendi/[fn:17] with the trials and tribulations of life as our
ancestors once did.

Surely the human suffers poorly. Again, all we may ever do is usher
the initially searing, inescapable pain to a dull ache in the backdrop
of time. Though again I would say this was better conducted in the
past than today. They did not attempt to contain, disguise,
systematise, or /process/ greif, rather, greif was faced directly,
pain was shared, empathy a way of life. And so emotional space was
allotted, support was communal, organic, and natural. Strikingly
different from today was their acceptance of /doom/[fn:18] and fate,
two concepts antithetical to our dynamic, positivist,
self-determining, fix-everything-quickly, cover-up-the-sticky-bits
modern attitudes.

Consider Queen Victoria[fn:19] who wore mourning black from the time
of her husband Prince Albert's death in 1861 till the end of her life
in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg who upon losing her husband
Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. In those days death was properly, officially mourned. No one
dared chivvy mourners along with their grief and sadness. Contrast
this with today's all-too-prevalent disassociation, the confused
emotional shutdown, the disorganised quasi-denial and suppression we
moderns too often show towards death[fn:20]. For the early nineteenth
century, poetising life's train of tragedy was depression
deconstruction as a life skill. The slings and arrows of human
existence found conjunction with /nature/, /darkness/, and /faith/
through poetry, thereby highlighting, elevating our uniquely human
experience on Earth, *casting a gossamer of sublimity over our natural
existence like no other generation before or since*. Theirs was the
deepest exploration of our true humanness that I know, and, thus,
something I must pursue.

** But why Dark?

But still, why Dark? Dark speaks to me, but, again, how, why? Lack of
a clear and simple answer forces me into a regrettably wordier one?
Dark remains mysterious---no matter how I try to imbibe or express
it. Dark is something instinctual, cathartic, evocative, centring for
me. Dark is more than the lack of light. Dark can lead the imagination
to riot. The moss, lichens, and mushrooms in the secretive shadows of
the forest incite so much more than the spectacular sunny vista across
the forest valley. The fresh-cut rose elicits one response, but the
faded rose another---deeper, but for me never dysphoric. Here is
something from my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/[fn:21]

#+begin_quote
The new cut rose: Initially beautiful, thereafter dried and
desiccated, lost forever its initial beauty and fragrance. Once
affording a glimpse of perfection, only reminiscent thereafter. Beauty
always some fleeting illusion or madness? Moreover its eclipse,
joining, leading the shadows of our relentless doom, our march to the
grave. And though I live in this momentary brilliance, I still search
my night shore; for until now I have known only of beauty’s haunting
rumour, of love’s promise, those slightest quickenings of things
necessarily rare and formerly peripheral. Yes, in this moment I may
have some of love’s bliss, but I know I will cherish with a larger,
more mature heart the memory thereof, an echo sent down life’s long,
clouded memory hall as the true and lasting blessing.
#+end_quote

Yes, there might have been a dinner invite for me back in the day... 

Let's see another example of get-it-or-don't, this time a poem from
Emily Elizabeth Dickinson[fn:22] of Amherst, Massachusetts,
her /There's a certain slant of light/[fn:23]

#+begin_verse
There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons — 
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes — 

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us — 
We can find no scar, 
But internal difference — 
Where the Meanings, are — 

None may teach it – Any — 
'Tis the seal Despair — 
An imperial affliction 
Sent us of the Air — 

When it comes, the Landscape listens — 
Shadows – hold their breath — 
When it goes, 'tis like the Distance 
On the look of Death — 
#+end_verse

Indeed. That last line includes /Death/ capitalised[fn:24]. Again, I
must emphasise these nineteenth-century artists understood death much
differently than we do today. Unfortunately, this capitalised,
past-century view of Death has become opaque, lost. I hope to
rediscover it. I'll start by positing their understanding of Death was
integral to their understanding of nature...

** Nature and Death in the nineteenth century

/The main points being:/
+ True nature is /birth, growth, deterioration, and death/, full
  stop, nothing else...
+ ...ergo, /nature is not a place/, inside or out, rather, a state of
  being...
+ ...ergo, no degrees of nature, rather, nature constant ubiquitous...
+ ...ergo, death is an integral part of true nature.
+ The increasingly extra-natural, quasi-immortal modern human
+ My poets' direct exposure to nature dominant versus our aloofness,
  estrangement from nature as planet-spatial.

I hold that our modern, twenty-first-century understanding of nature
is very different than that of early-nineteenth-century poets such as
the Haworth and Amherst Emilies[fn:25] and their contemporaries. Just
considering our indoor living environments today, a typical modern
building is more like a sealed /space station/ plopped down on a
hostile alien planet compared to the simpler, more primitive
structures of the not-so-distant past. Quite literally, the Brontës'
Haworth parsonage, built in 1778 out of local stone and wood and clay,
had more in common with human shelters from one, /two/ thousand years
previous than with our modern suburban homes only some two hundred
years later[fn:26]. Hence,

#+begin_quote
in just the past two to three hundred years a very steep, vertical
gradient or differential has grown between indoors and outdoors.
#+end_quote

This, in turn, has brought us to see nature more as a /place/ separate
and outside, cut off, away from our artificial, high-tech, controlled
and regulated modern indoor spaces[fn:27] ... which, in turn, has lead
us to rate /outdoors nature/ on continua of relative wildness and
remoteness from our sealed-off, self-contained, humans-only
environments.

<span class="cap">Homespun and one of its sources. Original art from Steve-Lease (DeviantArt.com)</span>@@
@@html:</span>@@

Even as late as my own childhood the term /homespun/ was in use to
indicate a poor, unsophisticated person, a country bumkin, a hick from
the sticks. The term referred to a person's clothing being homemade
from locally-sourced, hand-spun and woven materials such as linen and
wool rather than factory-made retail clothing. The early-nineteenth
century Brontëan West Yorkshire would have seen the majority of the
villagers in homespun, all but a few garments not hand-tailored
bespoke.[fn:28] And of course food was entirely from local
production. Hence, a person's daily resources were overwhelmingly
local, a small bit perhaps coming from a nearby /market town/, while
only the most exotic items (e.g., a clock) would have come from
farther away. Today, however, this supply pyramid is completely
flipped, as nearly everything comes from far (far!) away (e.g. China),
while only a few personal items would be from a local or even regional
source.[fn:29] And so in Brontëan times (first half of the 1800s) the
surrounding land was agriculturally domesticated, a working
partner. Contrast this with today's urban-suburban populations hardly
ever in contact with farmers or their farms. Nor do we know anything
about where our clothing came from. Today, nature as "the land," as
our immediate provider, has been completely abstracted into concepts
such as /ecosystems/, which implies we are now removed observers
controlling nature as if it were just another of our mechanical
objects.

No doubt we have always made a distinction between being /inside/ a
shelter and going /outside/ into the so-called /elements/. But
starting some six to ten thousand years ago we began to give up
aboriginal nomadic life and its direct daily contact with said
untamed, uncontrolled elements in order to establish permanent
city-states supported by mass monoculture agriculture. And so indoor
environments in ever-expanding urban centres became evermore
physically removed, walled off from the wild natural world, becoming
increasingly self-contained, all-encompassing, self-referencing, thus,
/recursively derivative/.[fn:30]

Along with this growing separation came mentalities, narratives
increasingly based indoors and /extra-natural/.[fn:31] Being indoors
meant we no longer were in direct contact with the nature spirits all
around; instead, praying to an extra-natural, off-world monotheistic
God in architectural showcase churches[fn:32]. Western architecture
seemed to reach a fantastical aesthetic crescendo in the Victorian
nineteenth century[fn:33], coinciding with an exponential growth in
urban population which had just passed an inflection point. Today the
steepness of our indoor-outdoor gradient has increased even more since
Victorian times ... resulting in a humanity more abstracted
/extra-natural/ than ever. How then may we, a species seemingly
capable of great adaptability,[fn:34] objectively measure our
separation from nature?  What has domestic, urban, indoor living done
to our brains, our sense of belonging to the planet, to one another?
How can we even begin to trace back the many rabbit hole bifurcations,
the chain of derivatives we've taken for all these centuries down,
out, and away from /nature pure/?  To be sure, we have demonstrated a
collective will to make conditions better for us /and us alone/. We
see our dominion over, abstraction away, separation from nature as
fate, as destiny. After all, our population doubling in less than
fifty years to eight billion[fn:35] says something to our intention
and ability to dominate. And we seem to have adapted our collective
human psyche, our narratives to this separation.[fn:36] /But is this
sustainable?/ All dark musings aside, many of us today have grown
concerned over the question of sustainability, concerned about our
long arc of estrangement from nature.[fn:37] Let me suggest a
completely different understanding of nature, namely---

#+begin_quote
Nature is not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature is everything going on everywhere. Nature as the myriad cycles
of *birth*, *growth*, *deterioration*, and *death* happening
everywhere all the time.
#+end_quote

I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, knew,
sensed this pre-modern meaning of nature as beyond inside or
outside. Yes, one went outside, out into the elements. But once back
indoors, a Brontë was not so completely out of and above nature's
touch, influence, /doom/ as we now fancy ourselves. Again, the cycles
of birth, growth, deterioration, and death were happening everywhere
/sans emplacement/. Consider how the Industrial Revolution created
urban production landscapes vast and barren and completely outside of
any sort of nature, spatial or otherwise---indeed, William Blake's
"satanic mills." Here is what Ludwig Klages in the late-1800s said

#+begin_quote
The face of the mainland has become a landscape of coerced
Chicago-ifications as humanity has fallen into an orgy of destruction
without precedence. So-called civilization wears the face of an
unleashed murderer, while the fullness, the bounty of the earth has
withered from his poisonous breath.
#+end_quote

This was a change on a scale never before seen, a huge and relatively
sudden step away from the physical world being solely the purveyance
of nature. And so even when the individual left his house he was still
deep within a massive concentration of extra-natural, human-exclusive
space and activity. Poverty in the pre-industrial rural landscape was
all but idyllic compared the grueling, grinding poverty of the
industrial cityscapes.[fn:38]

Here again is Emily Brontë from her poem /Shall earth no more inspire
thee/ where Mother Nature speaks directly to the wayward human

#+begin_verse
...
Thy mind is ever moving
In regions dark to thee;
Recall its useless roving—
Come back and dwell with me.
...
#+end_verse

I can't read this poem without having a very emotional
response. Indeed, the house of mirrors echo chamber that modern life
has become precludes any real adaptation. And so the choice is simple:
We can go back to nature or continue our useless roving, which can
only lead to evermore mental crisis and catastrophe.

To be sure, so much ominous and doomsday has been said about mass
society in this modern industrialised world—all pointing to the
increasingly obvious fact that our vaunted adaptation skills are being
stretched to the breaking point, dysphoria, as well as ecological
collapse inevitable.

And again Emily Brontë, her epic /The night is darkening round me/

#+begin_verse
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow;
But a tyrant spell has bound me,
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;
The storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below;
But nothing drear can move me;
I will not, cannot go.
#+end_verse

Yes, she is outdoors "facing the elements," as we say. She even refers
to the wilds as "wastes" and as "drear."[fn:39] And yet she is
transfixed, frozen to the spot---and I cannot, cannot go, as she
says. Subjective terms like wastes and drear refer to the age-old
attitude towards nature as a terrible, grim, inescapable master, a
sponsor of disaster and death, hardly over which to linger, let alone
wax poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that, and to be sure,
grandeur and sublimity expressed in lines of verse was the surprising
result. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared directly at
an enemy previously known as all-powerful and unforgiving, and in so
doing she sensed something deep and personally transformative. She was
stirred to write lines that, for me at least, are the very centre of
the mystery of life, death, and the Dark Muse.

Now, contrast Brontëan nature with Hemingway's twentieth-century
nature. Hemingway went hither and yon, all over the globe to do his
macho outdoors thing. But if anything serious had happened to him he
could have been airlifted out to receive modern medical care. Not the
Romantic Era poets who were in harm's way with no timeouts, no
escape. Would Hemingway have done all those macho-man things if there
had been no modern world with modern medical aid just a plane ride
away? Haworth Emily lived in a time when /nothing/ was modern, i.e.,
her West Yorkshire moorlands were semi-wilderness and early
eighteenth-century medicine didn't even know about germs.[fn:40]
Literally, a cut on a toe could become infected resulting in death.

With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around, the last two components, deterioration and
death, must be understood beyond our mechanistic reductionist modern
take of just physical malfunction.[fn:41] Back in the day, death was a
/force majeure/, but no longer thanks to modern medicine. It's almost
as if deterioration and death, two of nature's supposedly inescapable
realities, have been cordoned off---or at least placed under much
greater human control than ever before. /It's as if through modern
medicine we have begun to acquire a demi-godlike, proto-immortal veto
power over physical demise./ And with this control we have torn down,
dismantled a great component of spirituality, namely the reckoning of
one's mortality with a deity. Where once was supposed a /mortal/,
physical plane inferior an /immortal/ spiritual plane, we now would
believe only the physical plane to be relevant. And with this comes a
great psychic and spiritual impoverishment, the extent of which we
cannot fully know.

Though for the meantime death remains an undeniable certainty. Death
comes as it always has---from old age, fatal accident, or deadly
physical aggression or predation.[fn:42] But a completely different
attitude arises when modern healthcare's labyrinth of diagnoses,
drugs, procedures and surgeries routinely thwart what was once all but
certain, as well as swift demise. And so we've begun to lessen the
mystery of Death, overturn fate, consequence, and doom.

#+begin_verse
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
--- Psalm 90:10
#+end_verse

This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalistic,
absolute inevitability so resounding as to constantly shake and echo
through life. Death as life's backstop, container, timer, combinator,
reaper.[fn:43] And so I say, as death is interrupted, so are the
greater human cycles of emotion and spirituality interrupted.

Indeed, what if we start to take command of Death's appointment book,
rerouting, rescheduling Death's comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is
making the point that by no means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty
years of life, and even if we get them they might not be that
great. And yet we have grown to /expect/ from the implicit promises of
modern medical science a healthy, high-quality seventy, eighty,
ninety, or even more years. Again, modern medicine has disrupted the
two last components of a nature ubiquitous cyclic, i.e., deterioration
and death, thereby further collapsing our understanding of what true
nature is. Modern science has lessened the wallop of tragedy, weakened
overall the doominess of doom by redefining life as so much organic
machine circuitry, a mechanism that, in turn, is to be better and
better repaired, maintained, improved against entropic
wear-and-tear[fn:44].

Let me relate a modern story about our new attitude towards death. My
father, who has since passed away, lost his /third/ wife to lung
cancer caused inevitably by decades of smoking[fn:45]. But instead of
accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I finally theorised that he
had explicated from all the buzz of the various possible medical
interventions---including their probabilities of success or
failure---a hope that the death sentence of lung cancer could,
/should/ be beaten by some technology lurking in some corner of the
modern medical labyrinth. Alas...

Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed Death's arrival to
such an absurd degree. Human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of Death able to lap over at any time. But today
the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has become an all but
guaranteed minimum. Old age and death are increasingly spoken of as
"diseases" we can and should defeat. Death as a nuisance, indeed. My
father felt cheated when that three-, fourscore and more was not
forthcoming. But as you may anticipate, I contend life is life only
with Death---Death absolute and not easily pushed back, much less
obviated.

A sickly Anne Brontë[fn:46] on her final dying trip to Scarborough in
1849 had made a stop in York where she insisted on seeing the York
Minster. Upon gazing up at the great cathedral she said, "If finite
power can do this..."  But then she was overcome with emotion and fell
silent. Anne was in a deep and personal death mindset of utter and
complete humility and reverence. Indeed, God was in her death.

In my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/, which I will eventually discuss, I
have a character saying yes, she would get in a time machine and go
back the Brontëan times. But what if you faced a fifty-fifty chance of
dying from a now curable, fixable condition? her friend asks. Yes, she
replies, I would /trust/ my life, and /trust/ my death. Indeed. Who
can trust their death today?

** Death rises as Romanticism: Novalis

#+begin_quote
The world must be romanticised. In this way we will find again its
primal meaning. Romanticising is nothing but raising to a higher power
in a qualitative sense. In this process the lower Self becomes
identified with a better Self ... When I give a lofty meaning to the
commonplace, a mysterious prestige to the usual, the dignity of the
unknown to the known, an aura of infinity to the finite, then I am
romanticising. For the higher, the unknown, the mystical, the
infinite, the process is reversed---these are---expressed in terms of
their logarithms by such a connection---they are--reduced to familiar
terms.
#+end_quote

This is an oft-cited quote from[fn:47] the German nobleman Friedrich
Leopold /Freiherr/ (Baron) von Hardenberg (1772---1801), aka, Novalis,
who is considered by academe to be the original muse of the German
Romantic Movement, which coincided with similar literary happening in
Britain, quickly spreading throughout the English-speaking
diaspora. And yet most people have never heard of
Novalis. Specifically, it was his prose-poem cycle entitled /Hymns to
the Night/[fn:48] (hereafter /HTTN/) that set people around him
off. And the gathering of German intellectuals in Jena, Thuringia,
Germany, referred to as the /Jena Set/ by Andrea Wulf in her
/Magnificent Rebels/[fn:49] rallied around Novalis, and subsequently
tried to build on /HTTN/ and Novalis' romanticising poetising. Indeed,
what came to be known as Jena Romanticism[fn:50] spread to eager
circles and fertile grounds throughout the West.

Alas, but here is where I become quite the iconoclast, primarily by
insisting /nearly everyone has got Romanticism wrong!/ Even the actual
contemporaries around Novalis. Perhaps even Novalis himself! I posit
that Novalis with his foundational /HTTN/ took off in a straight line
into the Dark Muse[fn:51]. Just reading /HTTN/, one cannot escape the
sheer intensity of Novalis' swoon-fest over Night and
Death[fn:52]. Here's a small taste

#+begin_verse
I feel the flow of
Death's youth-giving flood;
To balsam and æther, it
Changes my blood!
I live all the daytime
In faith and in might:
And in holy rapture
I die every night.
#+end_verse

and just before came

#+begin_verse
What delight, what pleasure offers /thy/ life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night? Thy mother, it is she brings thee forth, and to her thou owest all thy glory.
#+end_verse

In my humble opinion, /HTTN/ is one of the densest, purest attesting to
the Dark Muse ever. As the legend tells, his inspiration came from
being grief-stricken at the death of his fifteen-year-old fiancée
Sophie von Kühn, to whose grave he pilgrimed for one hundred
nights. The Jena Set writer Ludwig Tieck
described the teenage Sophie

#+begin_quote
Even as a child, she gave an impression which---because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely---we must call super-earthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.
#+end_quote

HTTN is trance, vision, most certainly not just the gymnastics of
flipping the sacred to profane and profane to sacred as Novalis
describes Romanticism above. He journeyed into Dark and came back with
some of the purest Dark ever. /And this has little or nothing to do
with all the intellectualising copy produced by his Jena Set friends./
And here yawned open this great abyss between producers and
describer-promoters.[fn:53]

** John Keats' sense of Beauty

Samuel Taylor Coleridge is generally accepted as the leading
intellectualiser of British Romanticism during its inception roughly
parallel to the Jena Romantic liftoff. Following is a Coleridge quote
as good as any

#+begin_quote
...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each
other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the
accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as
the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible
directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces
should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike
indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible
yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which
their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and
the process of our own self-consciousness.
#+end_quote

Indeed, such wordy intellectualisations are the usual approach for
academics whipping up copy. Ironically, Coleridge could put aside his
explainer hat and put on his poet hat. He and Wordsworth's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrical_Ballads][Lyrical
Ballads]]/ are considered the cornerstone of English
Romanticism.[fn:54] Now, let us contrast this with what English poet John
Keats said years later in a 1817 letter to his brothers George and
Thomas

#+begin_quote
...I mean /Negative Capability/, that is, when a man is capable of
being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
reaching after fact and reason---Coleridge, for instance, would let go
by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of
mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with
half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no
further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty
overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all
consideration.
#+end_quote

Ideas, only those logically circumscribed, battling it out for
supremacy ... feelings and impressions and what-ifs lost in the ruckus
... intellectualisations, great and lengthy, especially of the
"Penetralium[fn:55] of mystery," just verisimilar[fn:56]
ramblings. Indeed, to /not/ immediately intellectualise, but to hold
oneself in a counter-intuitive state of unresolved---just to see where
it might lead. Then with a simple ode to Beauty the poet obviates,
obliterates the sterility of intellectualisation. Keats' /Negative
Capability/ is about /cognitive dissonance/ as a great and necessary
burden the poet must carry, a process key to deeper understanding
beyond neat and tidy piles of logical-seeming words to impress other
don't-get-it people.  Here is the famed beginning of his "poetic
romance" /Endymion/

#+begin_verse
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
#+end_verse

Take that Coleridge, you brachial babbling braincase!

In the 2009 film /Bright Star/, a touching verisimilar bio-drama about
Keats, there is a scene where, speaking with his love interest Fanny
Brawne, he says /A poet is not at all poetical. In fact, he the most
unpoetical thing in existence. He has no identity. He is continually
filling some other body---the sun, the moon./ He then says, /Poetic
craft is a carcass, a sham. If poetry does not come as naturally as
leaves to a tree then it had better not come at all./ And then Fanny
says, /I still don't know how to work out a poem./ To which Keats
says[fn:57]

#+begin_quote
A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving
in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the
lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not /work/ the
lake out. It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and
emboldens the soul to accept mystery.
#+end_quote

And thus, I would posit he, like I, did not see Romanticism as
something needs bundling and explaining and stuck with labels and
herded into categories. The point of hearing birdsong is not to think
about male birds warding off other males while trying to appeal to
females, but to luxuriate in the wonderful chorus of nature. Time and
time again I listen to or read a description of Romanticism and come
away with the feeling the scholar, the author understands nothing,
rather, is simply stringing disparate bits and bobs together for some
verisimilitude of a penetralia they don't really get, understand. And
so I say the intellectual prison yard in which academe has stuck
Romanticism should be opened up, the guards soundly switched and run
off, the prisoners let back out into the wide fields and deep woods.

** Thriving versus surviving; top dog versus underdog

In his book /The Genius of Instinct/ [fn:58] author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to /thrive/, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, but wait,
haven't these bats jumped /outside/ of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of /trans/-bat-ism. But is that a good thing?
In the meantime the bats profit. But for nature as a whole? In effect,
the bats have short-circuited their doom, their fate. Again, what are
the real long-term consequences?

Perhaps bats doing better is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis
the rest of their competitors and surrounding environment.[fn:59] And
yet what happens when a species keeps thriving more and more,
increasing its success statistics, stepping over, beyond any of the
natural restrictions that real integration and harmony with nature
would have required? *Aren't we humans Exhibit A of just such an
out-of-control species?* And so I ask, how can all this so-called
thriving be good, end well?  How can a dominant species like
ours---which always seems to be "gaming the system," evermore
ingeniously and aggressively extra-natural---not eventually have to
pay some price? Simply put, How can more and more people consuming
more and more resources and energy, each of us fantasising about
success and prosperity, not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?

Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to its tightly integrated niche, then
exponential growth ensues---which will eventually hit an inflexion
point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards an
inevitable overshoot and crash.

To my mind, Emily Brontë was just this sort of hard-pressed little bat
out in the wilds---colony-less, huddled in a hollow tree, barely eking
out a marginal life. Here is her /Plead for me/

#+begin_verse
Why I have persevered to shun
The common paths that others run;
And on a strange road journeyed on
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.

These once indeed seemed Beings divine,
And they perchance heard vows of mine
And saw my offerings on their shrine—
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,
And mine were worthily despised;

My Darling Pain that wounds and sears
And wrings a blessing out from tears
By deadening me to real cares;
And yet, a king---though prudence well
Have taught thy subject to rebel.

And am I wrong to worship where
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me
And tell why I have chosen thee!
#+end_verse

I consider this her ode to skipping the trans-human thrive scene of
her day and striking out into some Beyond to commune with her God of
Visions. Again, I must believe she was a little bat fluttering across
the semi-wilderness moorland, as true an existential /underdog/ as was
still possible back then.

Compare this with today's outdoor adventurer who clad in his technical gear
from REI, Patagonia, North Face, drives to government set-aside wilds
in a four-wheel-drive Jeep Cherokee, consumed protein bars and
electrolyte drinks, listens to music with earbuds, takes smart
phone pictures and GoPro videos. Any mishaps? Call for immediate
helicopter rescue on a satellite connection... At some point we're
just amateur Earth astronauts, no? When nature is in balance, all
participants are underdogs to some degree. But we want and have gained
total dominance over Nature.

Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced malnutrition, contaminated
water, tuberculosis --- pick one, two, or all three---five months
after her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the greater world outside
of her tiny Haworth village and its surrounding hills for a few
months.[fn:60] As I've said, hers was a world containing nothing
modern as we know it, e.g., a cut on a toe could lead to an infection
requiring amputation, or even worse.

And yet one might ask if her existence in the early nineteen century
was really so very wild and rugged. Was she still not observing nature
from civilization's relative place of safety, thereby rendering her
observations just as tainted, just as removed and relative as ours
today? I say no. Clearly our modern place of safety is maximal, hers
minimal, as we of the twenty-first century float above cruel Nature on
unprecedented levels of modern high-tech
materialism.[fn:61] Nonetheless, I contend hers was a unique vantage
point, neither too exposed nor removed from elemental nature.

So often I am confronted with modern scoffers who would have us
believe Romantic Era poets only knew nature from picnics held at
country estates where dandies and their pampered ladies were attended
by servants, as seen, for example, in Hollywood film versions of Jane
Austen's /Emma/[fn:62]

#+begin_export html
<img src="./images/EmmaPicnic2.png" width="770" alt="Emma picnic">
<span class="cap"><b>Emma</b> picnic in the harrowing wilds of England</span>
#+end_export

Again, for us moderns nature is a /place/, a /location/ away from and
diametrically opposite our modern interior spaces. Nature today is
seen as this vast other place, the /Great Outdoors/. Therefore, the
farther afield from modern civilization we can go, the truer and more
authentic nature supposedly becomes. And so we create a /nature
continuum/ whereby a trackless wilderness as far from civilization as
possible is the truest nature, while hardly nature at all would be a
ditch overgrown with weeds behind one of our triple-paned windowed,
vinyl-siding-clad, forced-air-HVAC suburban houses. Nature can only be
very wild, thus, very far away from the safety of our space-colony
civilization. But let me again be blunt

#+begin_quote
We do not get more nature simply because we have gone like explorer
astronauts way farther out from our sterile, artificial exclusively
human home base. /Nature is not something close or remote./
#+end_quote

It is precisely because we have so destroyed proximate Nature that we
elevate far-afield wilderness to a practically quasi-off-planet
status. Writers like Ernest Hemingway and Jack London exploit fright
memes of Nature as a distant, exotic, hostile place ... again,
virtually identical to science fiction stories of strange, hostile,
dangerous, alien planets conquered by brave, intrepid astronauts. To
be sure, many sci-fi depictions of alien worlds are interchangeable
with the Klondike Yukon that London described.

No, my poets of the so-called Romantic Era were not pampered dandies
with their fine ladies strolling for a few bored minutes on manicured
estate grounds. Nor were they beneficiaries of the "Age of
Exploration" colonialism. My poets were mainly short-lived little bats
in their crevasses and corners, as pressed as any bats have ever been.

** Eighteenth-century British Dark

...though Britain was seeing Dark decades before Novalis and German
Romanticism. As I do with Novalis and his /HTTN/, I can't help but
believe these eighteenth-century English principals were more
sleepwalkers than any sort of intentional movement leaders. First came
The /Graveyard School/ of poetry full of doom and gloom, then just
past mid-century the gothic romance novel arrived with an even more
graphic doom-and-gloom. But then came what might be called the /Night
School/, which became the basis of my dark corner of Romanticism.

*** The Graveyard School

It was only a few decades into the eighteenth century when there
emerged in Britain a style of poetry which has since been named the
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_poets][Graveyard School]]/. My Exhibit A of Graveyard is Edward Young's
epic-length /[[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33156/33156-h/33156-h.htm][The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts on Life, Death, &
Immortality]]/ (or simply /Night-Thoughts/, ca. 1742-1745).[fn:63]
Bursting with a grandiosity only poetry can reach, Young relentlessly
spins out darkness and doom. To be sure, he is Dark with a shudder,
full of fright memes meant to weigh down and ultimately defeat---if
taken seriously. A quick taste, s'il vous plaît

#+begin_verse
"When the cock crew, he wept”---smote by that eye
Which looks on me, on all: that Power, who bids
This midnight sentinel, with clarion shrill
(Emblem of that which shall awake the dead),
Rouse souls from slumber, into thoughts of heaven.
Shall I too weep? Where then is fortitude?
And, fortitude abandon’d, where is man?
I know the terms on which he sees the light;
He that is born, is listed; life is war;
Eternal war with woe. Who bears it best,
Deserves it least...
#+end_verse

...indeed, unrelenting doom and woe. Typical of Graveyard
School, there is no hope, no escape, just the weight of an assumed
curse, then processions of lamentation to cliff edges and fated
tumbling thereoff

#+begin_verse
Art, brainless Art! our furious charioteer...
...Drives headlong towards the precipice of death;
Death, most our dread; death thus more dreadful made:
Oh, what a riddle of absurdity!
#+end_verse

or

#+begin_verse
From short (as usual) and disturb’d repose,
I wake: how happy they, who wake no more!
Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave.
I wake, emerging from a sea of dreams
Tumultuous; where my wreck’d desponding thought
From wave to wave of fancied misery
At random drove...
#+end_verse

Of course every student of the Dark Muse should read Young's
/Night-thoughts/. And yet this over-the-top doom hyperbole eventually
delivers even the most indulgent reader to incredulity. To be sure, at
some point it becomes farce. Though Graveyard had a more
contemplative, measured side. For example, Thomas Gray's /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44299/elegy-written-in-a-country-churchyard][Elegy
Written in a Country Churchyard]]/ (1751). To be sure, the eulogising of
the dead is a much older and well established genre, typically
emphasising the qualities of the deceased over the dark, eternal abyss
his grave might represent. While we're not meant to survive Young's
world, Gray's elegy of a lost friend is Dark and fatalist and yet
reverent faithful

#+begin_verse
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.
#+end_verse

Here whatever negatives---sinister, morose, and doomy---may be
swirling about, God in his heavenly domain has our backs. Gray doesn't
try to beat us down as much as did the hardcore Graveyard
Schoolers. And yet with Graveyard, Britain had arrived at a public
exhibition of Dark.

Was Dark simply in the air? In my humble opinion, Graveyard arrived
unexpected, a natural, organic upwelling---however spotty its actual
expression. Which begs the question, What rises to cultural and
intellectual prominence in an age?[fn:64] To be sure, many of that era
condemned gothic and Graveyard as subculture. But eventually came
refinement, which I might call the /Night School/. Though intervening
was the /gothic novel/.

*** The arrival of the /gothic novel/

Prose versus poetry. In the past poetry was seen by members of polite
upper-class circles as the higher, the acceptable form of
literature[fn:65]. Prose in the form of the novel,[fn:66] on the other
hand, was not acceptable, seen as too revealing invasive personal,
i.e., it is improper, unseemly, distasteful to expose even an
imaginary person's life details in such an open and revealing
fashion. According to this attitude, it was a crude thing to so freely
fantasise human goings-on in a fictitious way. Rather, literature must
ennoble the human as a being created in the likeness of God, and not
dwell on his mundanity and failings. After all, a novel was neither
factual (e.g. a saint's hagiography) nor high lyrical poetic (e.g.,
church hymn lyrics or /Heldenlieder/). A novel/roman was simply too
plain-spoken, i.e., the unavoidable clarity of straight descriptive
writing invariably generated an undesirable ordinariness. And so it
was in this mise en scène that the prose novel bumped along
post-Medieval Age as a barely tolerated corruption of writing, as a
regrettable parallel to poetry, consumed mainly by easily excited
arriviste vulgarian middle-class women. But then as the middle class
grew in power and numbers, the novel came to the fore, especially in
the eighteenth century.[fn:67]

Modern academe considers the novel /The Castle of Otranto, A Gothic
Story/, appearing in its first edition in 1764, to be the official
start of British /gothic/ literature.[fn:68] Written by the excentric,
iconoclastic English nobleman Horace Walpole (1717 – 1797), /Otranto/
is a melodrama set in sixteenth-century Naples offering slumming
readers a big dose of darkness, doom, and woe. Walpole's penchant for
medievalism rode the long-simmering nostalgic idealisation of the
Medieval Age[fn:69], while the adjective /gothic/ referred to medieval
Gothic architecture.[fn:70] Gothic "horror" was an instant hit, and
other writers and influencers quickly joined in creating a full-on
Dark movement.[fn:71] The popularity of the gothic novel continued
throughout the nineteenth and into the twentieth century primarily in
the Romance genre. Among others, Frances Parkinson Keyes (1885 – 1970)
was a popular romance author who often wrote from a gothic
perspective. /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonwyck_(film)][Dragonwyck]]/ (1946) is a prime example of
Hollywood[fn:72] does gothic romance.

<span class="cap">Wolf's Crag from Walter Scott's gothic <i>The Bride of Lammermore</i> </span>
#+end_export

Above is an etching from a publication of Sir Walter Scott's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_of_Lammermoor][The
Bride of Lammermore]]/ (1819). Consider the sheer visual density and
heaviness of the scene (click on the image to be taken to a larger
version). Whence, wherefore this heaviness, this portent?  Predominant
is nature dark, inhospitable, threatening. The human-built castle is
primitive, isolated, and vulnerable, the riders miniscule, exposed. It
is as if every single living cell---plant, animal, human---is clinging
to life by a thread, and any dim green and blue hues of vegetation and
sea are wholly irrelevant. The scene evokes danger, dysphoria,
something horrific just waiting to transpire. But again how, why? Why
such darkness and what was (and still is) the appeal? Hitchcock
tautologies aside, modern academe has offered theories about the
socio-political-psychological landscape of the times, and yet these
"experts" only sound supercilious and patronising from their modern
triumphalist perches, as if they are searching for a disease to
explain a malady, weakness to explain indulgence. No, indeed, Dark,
even when crude and heavy, predominates, arrests, mystifies, the
appeal all the stronger for its recessive, ungraspable spherical
symmetry. To be sure, this "coming out" of gothic in the eighteenth
century was overwrought, overweight with its fright memes, but
undeniably popular and onto something real about the inner human
experience.

*** The night, the stars the moon...

As assuredly personal and original as Novalis' /Hymns to the Night/
was, Englishwoman Anna  Lætitia Barbauld's /[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_(Barbauld)/A_Summer_Evening%27s_Meditation][A Summer Evening's
Meditation]]/ had already appeared in 1773 praising the night in a
similarly cherished, solemn way. Without deeper investigation I have
no real idea if Barbauld's /Meditation/ started what I'm calling the
/Night School/, but as a working theory, yes, she offered a new
perspective to Dark with an accessibility and maturity not seen in
Graveyard or gothic horror. After a nod to Young's /Night-thoughts/
with the quote, /One sun by day, by night ten thousand shine/,
Barbauld launches directly into her summer night and its canopy of
stars...

#+begin_verse
Tis past! The sultry tyrant of the south
Has spent his short-liv'd rage; more grateful hours
Move silent on; the skies no more repel
The dazzled sight, but with mild maiden beams
Of temper'd light, invite the cherish'd eye
To wander o'er their sphere; where hung aloft
Dian's bright crescent, like a silver bow
New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns
Impatient for the night, and seems to push
Her brother down the sky. Fair Venus shines
E'en in the eye of day; with sweetest beam
Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood
Of soften'd radiance from her dewy locks.
The shadows spread apace; while meeken'd Eve
Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires
Thro' the Hesperian gardens of the west,
And shuts the gates of day. 'Tis now the hour
When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,
#+end_verse

No woe, no gloom-and-doom, rather, a relentless parade of visceral and
natural Dark hyperconductivity. Barbauld hauls us outdoors to partake,
imbibe, behold. We are not obsessing on doom, rather, we are touched,
moved to reflect in reverence---

#+begin_verse
...But are they silent all? or is there not
A tongue in every star that talks with man,
And wooes him to be wife; nor wooes in vain:
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.
At this still hour the self-collected soul
Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there
Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;
An embryo God; a spark of fire divine,
Which must burn on for ages, when the sun,
(Fair transitory creature of a day!)
Has clos'd his golden eye, and wrap'd in shades
Forgets his wonted journey thro' the east.
#+end_verse

Night over day. Night a more expansive, passive, more nuanced
interim inviting deeper, more mature human introspection. Far distant,
cool and gentle are the myriad stars, unlike our single oversized and
often ruinous local star of day. And here is some of my own doggerel called /From a Grandniece To Her
Great-aunt At Her Great-uncle’s Funeral/

#+begin_verse
You see, dear Auntie, 
Day is all supposes, 
Night but only a few.
Night quietly closes 
Day’s great to-do.
Lost on the Day,
I wait for deepest Night,
for Darkness and I must
Decline clamant Light. 
#+end_verse
  
I mean to say this is my kind of Dark, i.e., free of any campy fright
devices. Most assuredly every protégé of the Dark Muse must read
Barbauld's lengthy masterpiece. Hers is an exposition of natural
darkness, placing it far above the reproach of gothic horror
detractors. Though /Meditation/ was no doubt a singleton, a unicorn
whose influence seemed to lay dormant for decades.[fn:73] One Barbauld
biographer mentioned a trend of that time of ladies studying
astronomy. But obviously Barbauld is waxing Dark, not embellishing
celestial bodies. Perusing her other poems, yes, she dwells on nature,
sometimes in a dusky way, but addressing Dark as she did with
/Meditation/ never again appeared so directly during her times. Today
she is known as an influential social commentator, moralist, and
educator, not as proto-Romantic. And so I must jump ahead some fifty
years and bring in Brontëan poetry as a continuation of this Night
School thread. Haworth Emily's /[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Poems_of_Emily_Bront%C3%AB/Stars][Stars]]/ is just one her many examples
of Night School from someone who probably had never read nor heard of
Barbauld's /Meditation/. Exactly like Barbauld, in /Stars/ Haworth
Emily lauds the night and its starry sky

#+begin_verse
Thought followed thought, star followed star
Through boundless regions, on;
While one sweet influence, near and far,
Thrilled through, and proved us one!

Why did the morning dawn to break
So great, so pure, a spell;
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,
Where your cool radiance fell?
#+end_verse

The night sky's depth and expanse over the trammels of life during
sunlight, indeed. And so the last two stanzas

#+begin_verse
Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night;
Oh, night and stars, return!
And hide me from the hostile light
That does not warm, but burn;

That drains the blood of suffering men;
Drinks tears, instead of dew;
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,
And only wake with you!
#+end_verse

Night School redeems Dark by pulling it out of the ostentatiousness,
the gimmickry of Graveyard and gothic. Started by Barbauld, it was
independently embraced by others. Let's look at sister Anne Brontë's
/Night/

#+begin_verse
I love the silent hour of night,
For blissful dreams may then arise,
Revealing to my charmed sight
What may not bless my waking eyes.

And then a voice may meet my ear,
That death has silenced long ago;
And hope and rapture may appear
Instead of solitude and woe.

Cold in the grave for years has lain
The form it was my bliss to see;
And only dreams can bring again,
The darling of my heart to me.
#+end_verse

Simpler, more measured was Anne's poetry than her sister's. And she
includes the grave by eulogising either of her older sisters Maria or
Elizabeth, or her mother, but again, sans drama.

This calmer, more introspective Dark dominated the eighteenth
century. And let us not forget the many poems devoted to the
moon. Here is Anne's /Fluctuations/

#+begin_verse
What though the Sun had left my sky;
To save me from despair
The blessed Moon arose on high,
And shone serenely there.

I watched her, with a tearful gaze,
Rise slowly o'er the hill,
While through the dim horizon's haze
Her light gleamed faint and chill.

I thought such wan and lifeless beams
Could ne'er my heart repay
For the bright sun's most transient gleams
That cheered me through the day:

But, as above that mist's control
She rose, and brighter shone,
I felt her light upon my soul;
But now—that light is gone!

Thick vapours snatched her from my sight,
And I was darkling left,
All in the cold and gloomy night,
Of light and hope bereft:

Until, methought, a little star
Shone forth with trembling ray,
To cheer me with its light afar—
But that, too, passed away.

Anon, an earthly meteor blazed
The gloomy darkness through;
I smiled, yet trembled while I gazed—
But that soon vanished too!

And darker, drearier fell the night
Upon my spirit then;—
But what is that faint struggling light?
Is it the Moon again?

Kind Heaven! increase that silvery gleam
And bid these clouds depart,
And let her soft celestial beam
Restore my fainting heart!
#+end_verse

Here we may imagine the youngest Brontë bowed if not weighed down by
her earthly afflictions, cares, deprivations, but then in this lean,
hungry, susceptible state caught in an emotional whirling, carried,
borne up by the natural nighttime procession of sun to moon and
stars. She speaks of her tearful gaze, her fainting heart, her
spirits, her emotional exposure. She is a vulnerable ward of nature,
but tenaciously pursuant of its subtleties. Indeed, back then it was
always subtleties, delicate qualities found in nature by the
vulnerable if not pathetic human, an exacting counting of seemingly
modest blessings which then gained sublime ascendency.

If I wasn't pledged to Emily, I might say Anne has an even finer take
on Dark than her older sister. I might dare to say Anne's Christianity
is more conventional, whereas Emily with her obvious
thought-behind-thoughts mental state took a starker, more fatalist view of
God. Anne humble, Emily defiant perhaps; *nevertheless, the Dark Muse
absolutely owned by these Brontës!*

Just for some balance, let me mention another Night Schooler, namely,
the Swiss poet [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Keller][Gottfried Keller]]. Again, he is even later by some
three or four decades than the Brontës. Here is his /Winternacht/ or
/Winter Night/

#+begin_verse
Not a wingbeat went through the world;
silent and brilliant lay the white snow.
Not a puff of cloud hung in the starry canopy,
no wave surged in the torpid lake.
 
From the depths climbed a lake-tree,
to its crown encased in ice;
and upon its branches climbed the water nymph,
gazing up through the green ice.
 
There I stood upon the thin glass
that separated me from the black depths;
Close beneath my feet I saw
her white beauty, limb for limb.
 
With smothered sorrow she groped
here and there on the hard barrier.
Never will I will forget her dark expression;
always, always, shall it remain in my mind!
#+end_verse

One of my favourites, I have always wondered what the protagonist did
with the rest of his life. Did he return to the lake trying to find
his water nymph; or did he resign himself to his mortal and mundane
life? In any event, the mystery and allure of a forest in deep winter
night is undeniable. Such magic and mystery obviously could not have
occurred in daylight.

With Night School, first there is Nature Dark, then comes human
reflection upon that natural Dark, i.e., no fake Dark, no camp, no
hyperbole. Just the deepest possible descriptions of the world in
darkness bringing forth some of humanity's finest insights.

** A Romantic movement by any other name

#+begin_quote
And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books
there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
---Ecclesiastes 12:12
#+end_quote

Academe's take on Romanticism---a very big elephant in the middle of
the room, indeed. What to do with this beast wont to co-opt and usurp
my principals, and, in general, completely miss my Dark Muse?
Foremost is how academe Romanticism seems more the labeling work of
these clueless busy-bodies than any intentional movement from the
actual creators.[fn:74] Which begs the question posed by the
highly-respected humanities professor Isaiah Berlin in his lecture
series on Romanticism whether those times were not something timeless,
a permanent state of mind wholly outside of anyone's historical fence
work.[fn:75] Nevertheless, there is no avoiding the sweeping
intellectualisations, the mountains of churn from Romanticism's
academic investigators. And as I say, /none/ get Dark.

Thus, the cleft between what Romanticist scholars say we are reading
and what you or I might simply feel upon reading can be huge. And that
is my whole point here. Worse, scholars can be all over the map with
these pontifications and theories. Andrea Wulf's /Magnificent
Rebels/ depicts Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as the adult-supervision
den dad of Jena Romanticism, and yet here is something he actually
said about Romanticism

#+begin_quote
Klassisch ist das Gesunde, romantisch das Kranke ... or
... Romanticism is disease. It is the weak, the sickly, the battle cry
of a school of wild poets and Catholic reactionaries; whereas
classicism is strong, fresh, gay, sound, like Homer and the
/Nibelungenlied/.
#+end_quote

I won't accuse Wulf of poor research or intentional
obfuscation. Having been a founder of /Sturm und Drang/, perhaps we
should grant Goethe the right to have been of two minds. Perhaps he
was initially attracted to the Jena buzz, all the /haute pensée/
sprung up in his backyard, but then soured on its content,
implications, the personalities behind it. Certainly Schiller
did. Still, this as an example of how diverse, even contradictory
Romantic Era scholarship can be.

Yes, the would-be shepherds, the explainers talked something into
existence---the Jena Set, Coleridge, Germaine de Staël, Emerson et
al.---but again, I believe the actual producers were far-sighted,
inward-gazing, quasi-timeless unicorns not following guidelines or
living up to anybody's expectations.[fn:76] ... and most certainly
they did not "write to spec" or pastiche, as was fairly obviously the
case with gothic horror novelists. And so I say sifting through all
the academic chaff gets us nowhere versus simply reading and silently
contemplating the product itself. All for naught listing facts and
figures, creating categories and pigeonholes, imagining commonalities,
generalities, throwing a formulaic hyperspace over the lone wolf
creators. Caveat emptor. If the purpose of a poem, as Keats said, is
to embolden the soul to accept mystery, then such analytical death
marches must be seen as antithetical. Analysing mystery is a fool's
errand.[fn:77] For me at least, the principals /re-sensitised/, while their
describers have only managed to /de-sensitise/ with their mystery-deaf
approach.

Some insight comes from two men of this era who unfortunately wore
both hats, i.e., creator and explainer, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and
Edgar Allan Poe. With them we see their creations take us into the
ephemeral mists of Romanticism's subtleties and sublimities, while
their intellectualizations and pontifications thereof sound windy, if
not shrill out to ridiculous. No wonder the concept of left-brain,
right-brain arose,[fn:78] as nothing else can describe this
split-personality confusion. But the urban salons necessarily
trafficked in rational, left-brain talk and copy. And this is for me
the /crisis of Romanticism/, i.e., the huge divide between the
creators and their content versus the describers and promoters. Yes Mr
Keats, we shall luxuriate long in the water, but then slowly, gently
swim back to the shore to gracefully and silently rise out of the
water and stand exulted for the whole experience. Of course we cannot
luxuriate in the lake forever, but upon exiting we must somehow hold
the experience in awe and reverence and not grasp for logical
explanations, which can only turn it into a show, a farce, even so, a
sham, a carcass.

*** English and German Romanticism

Today a hit song or a TikTok video can go "viral" globally in less
than a day, with imitations instantly springing up like mushrooms
after rain. But in the closing years of the eighteenth century there
just seemed to be something in the air, which came to be called
Romanticism, apparently first by Jena Set founder Friedrich
Schlegel[fn:79] ... after Coleridge and Wordsworth's collaboration
/Lyrical Ballads/ (first edition) appeared in 1798 and Novalis' /HTTN/
in 1800. But again, my principle principal, Emily Brontë, who wrote
decades later, arguably knew very little to absolutely nothing about
Jena, Novalis, or even much of Coleridge and Wordsworth other than
perhaps a reading of their /Lyrical Ballads/. Even later, Poe had
supposedly had encountered translations of Ludwig Tieck's short
stories. Otherwise, there had not been much cross-fertilisation,
rather, the Romanticism Muse was just in the air.

/Early German Romanticism/[fn:80] began when Novalis' /HTTN/ burst
upon the scene in the very first year of the nineteenth century. Clear
to me, however, is that /HTTN/ was a one-off that came out of the
blue, thus, certainly not intentional, positioned for, or tailored to
any specific trend or agenda. Contrast this with Goethe's play
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Tauris_(Goethe)][Iphigenia in Tauris]]/ (versions in 1779, 1781, 1786), based on
Euripides' original which was specifically meant to be a showcase
example of Goethe's ideal of modern classicism, i.e., his and
Friedrich Schiller's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Classicism][Weimar Classicism]]. But the so-called /Jena Set/,
an intellectual salon centred around the Schlegel brothers, August
Wilhelm and Friedrich, along with August's wife Caroline, seized upon
the mostly absentee Novalis as their boy wonder /Liebling/
mascot---and the conflation of producer and describers began in
earnest. But just one year after /HTTN/ appeared Novalis dies on
them. The seed sprouted, the Jena Set went on to create an entire
mountain range of Jena Romanticism supposedly inspired by boy-man hero
Novalis[fn:81]. Philosopher Schelling was on board, and it is his
"nature philosophy" which is adopted and promoted by Coleridge
(sometimes as literal translation as in his [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographia_Literaria][Biographia
Literaria]] - 1817) and eventually by Emerson and the Transcendentalists
in the Colonies. Any brightening of the ominous tremendous /HTTN/ is
irksome, but if we stay loyal to Dark, we may reach further back to
the English /[[https://www.britannica.com/art/graveyard-school][Graveyard School]]/ of the mid- and late-eighteenth
century.

*** Poe and Dark Romanticism

For example /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Romanticism][Dark Romanticism]]/ was supposedly a phenomenon, and at its
centre was Edgar Allan Poe.[fn:82] Unfortunately The Wikipedia description of
Dark Romantic trots out all the negative stereotypes of Dark. But as
one biographer noted, Poe struggled all his short adult life to make a
living as a writer and poet. One supposed quote of his said “... your
writer of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big pen,
with a very blunt nib.” However the American publishing world was
rarely supportive, as one historian said, eager to move on from Dark
and gothic. And yet Poe always seemed to find audiences.

#+begin_verse
It was many and many a year ago,
   In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
   By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
   Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love—
   I and my Annabel Lee—
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
   Coveted her and me.

And this was the reason that, long ago,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
   My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsmen came
   And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
   In this kingdom by the sea.

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
   Went envying her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
   Of those who were older than we—
   Of many far wiser than we—
And neither the angels in Heaven above
   Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;

For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
   In her sepulchre there by the sea—
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.

My principals had nothing to do with Schlegels or Coleridge or Emerson.

  There a gave way to the more

Again, I suss out that both Poe and Emily Brontë got it and gave it

Fright v. melancholy.






After writing on my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ for the past seven years
I have made a rather bitter discovery, namely, that mankind is largely
wandering about clueless --- /seriously/ clueless.



** Feeling our way out of the Enlightenment

#+begin_quote
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even
touched --- they must be felt with the heart. \\
--- Helen Keller
#+end_quote

I sometimes get the /feeling/ that my Romantic Era poet principals
were unknowingly, belatedly trying to stamp a new European nature
worship out of the moors and forest floors---necessarily independent
of whatever had been the vernacular beliefs before the Romans. Though
first and foremost I believe they were instinctively countering the
latest rise of /desensitisation/ brought on by colonialism,
Enlightenment, and their nasty fruits, namely, industrialism, by
trying /re-sensitise/, à la Novalis' poetising. I like both,
actually. And yet Romanticism scholars invariably trot out their
simplistic equation

\begin{align*}
\Large{\text{Romanticism = feelings}}
\end{align*}

as if Romanticism was just some emotional sideshow, an effete,
irrational outburst, a reactionary, mob mentality counterattack
against the Enlightenment dynamism juggernaut ... conjuring up again
the image of the privileged-pampered lounging at picnics counting
butterflies, or /Salonlöwen/[fn:83] reading poetry in candlelit
parlours thinking they were witnessing against the satanic mills. But
could poetised feeling sit atop and pretend to control, marshal,
govern all the violent dynamism behind the colonialism, the satanic
mills? How was Romanticism to be the aesthetics of, the contemporary
cultural offerings to such a coercive materialism? It was not, it
could not be. And therein lies so much of the irony and paradox. How
could The British Empire at the height of its power and reach have
William Wordsworth as its poet laureate? Of course the Brontë sisters
languished in obscurity most of their lives, but in the latter half of
the eighteenth century, they and other Victorian Neo-Romanticisms
clearly portrayed a different Britain from the capitalist, militarist
reality. Consider the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (founded in
1848). Below is a later painting of John Everett Millais, /An
Idyll of 1745/

#+begin_export html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Everett_Millais#/media/File:An_Idyll_of_1745_(Millais).jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./images/Millais AnIdyllof1745.jpg" width="780" alt="Millais Idyll"></a>
<span class="cap">Before YouTube and hysterical helicopter parents...</span>
#+end_export

Of course Britain in 1745 was not dominant domineering yet, rather,
fighting for its existence against, mainly the French, still suffering
the echoing collective PTSD of the bloody seventeenth-century British
civil wars less than a hundred years earlier. And yet Millais painting
this in 1884 was hearkening back to, yes, an /idyllic/ time. Three
innocent, tabula rasa peasant girls are enraptured by an enlisted man
playing a flute while a fatherly high-born officer looks on
admiringly. Clearly, this is the Britain so yearned, so longed for by
nostalgia-heavy Pre-Raphaelitism. Great rueing and regretting
permeated Victorian parlour society. See beside as well Millais'
/The Blind Girl/.[fn:84] This was the real England, the true England they
wanted, and not the bloody savagery of colonialism imperialism, nor
the horrific suffering of the urban industrial wastelands Charles
Dickens came to chronicle.

No
more that Christianity before it could.

Romanticism portrayed as a furtherance of Enlightenment freedom of
expression is also farcical. See how eighteenth-century gothic doom
paralleled the beginning of the Industrial Revolution's inflexion
point, as well as the reverberations of colonialism, e.g.,
slavery. Doom, where sins' ever compounded interest smashed any
profits, gains. Dynasties subject to Old Testament's crashing woe.

*** Desensitisation, re-sensitisation

The /radical philosophers/, as the proto-Marxist activists were called
by some, were about power and wealth, i.e., the haves versus the
have-nots. Marxist dialectics then said when the gradient is too great
necessarily the revolution will begin. Grim was the new industrial
urban, the largely subsistence peasants now wage slaves living in
existential terror of squalor, hunger, and exploitation. /Homo homini
lupus/[fn:85] had once again raised its terrible head in a new and
cataclysmic way. perception hang-ups, much less emotion
brake-checking. There was no pause to reflect on

#+begin_quote
The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof,
but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every
one that is born of the Spirit. \\
---John 3:8

And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all
things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to
the sons of man to be exercised therewith. \\
---Ecclesiastes 1:13
#+end_quote

Humanity born of Spirit forever feeling wind in our faces and circling
around wisdom ... almost as if there is a sanctity in what may emerge
from consciousness beyond behaviorist stimulus-response,
action-reaction, the Day's to-dos: order, change, progress.

Perhaps my Romantic Era principals sensed the hyper-individualistic
reptilian mindset from the middle-class capitalist
industrialists[fn:86] as a egregious desensitisation regime spreading
throughout society, and threw a re-sensitisation at it.



Marxism dispenses with aesthetics, while my principals could not do
without an aesthetical foundation---and then only adorned said
foundation with poetisings. And of course there was no "call to action."

No, my principle principals

Here I will simply and plainly state that I believe Emily Jane Brontë
was the very centre, the utter culmination of the whole Romanticism
thing---ironically _the most outside_ of any Romanticism boxing or
packaging by academe. She combined in her /poetry/[fn:87]

+ *Pagan Nature*,
+ *Dark*, and
+ *Christianity*

and in keeping with Keats' /Negative Capability/ she did not let any
one or two overshadow the other two or one. *Like a frontier one-room
school teacher, she forced the rowdy peasant boys Pagan Nature, Dark,
and Christianity sit close enough on the school bench to smell each
other.* Her nature awareness mentioned above would be enough, but my
Haworth Emily brings something even deeper to the table. She forced
nature paganism and Christianity to sit close to each other on the
rock on the moors, on the bench in the church, close enough to smell
each other. Here I'll repeat what I consider to be her other two
points, namely, the Dark and Christianity in these three poems

+ /The night is darkening round me/ (once more),
+ /I'll come when thou art saddest/ and
+ /I would have touched the heavenly key/

which appear clumped together as poem /31./ in /Emily Brontë The Complete
Poems/ from Penguin Classics

#+begin_verse
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow;
But a tyrant spell has bound me
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow,
And the storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below;
But nothing drear can move me—
I will not, cannot go.

---

I'll come when thou art saddest,
Laid alone in the darkened room;
When the mad day's mirth has vanished,
And the smile of joy is banished
From evening's chilly gloom.

I'll come when the heart's real feeling
Has entire unbiased sway,
And my influence o'er thee stealing,
Grief deepening joy congealing,
Shall bear thy soul away.

Listen 'tis just the hour,
The awful time for thee;
Dost thou not feel upon thy soul
A flood of strange sensations roll,
Forerunners of a sterner power,
Heralds of me?

---

I would have touched the heavenly key
That spoke alike of bliss and thee;
I would have woke the evening song,
But its words died upon my tongue.
But then I knew that he stood free,
Would never speak of joy again,
And then I felt ...

However, the pagan

Along came one  and threaded
a very convoluted path between 

** All travesties aside...

What if we all went around completely misrepresenting each other,
telling outlandishly false things about whomever whenever? Enmity,
feuding, the breakdown of society, perhaps even civil war would
ensue---at the very least lawyers would get rich from all the libel
and slander lawsuits. But what if the people about whom we are lying
and making up complete fabrications are long since dead? In today's
Hollywood they are fair game...

The travesties I mean are the modernist triumphalist revisionist,
intentionally anachronistic misrepresentations of my two main
principals, i.e., the two Emilies, Brontë and Dickinson, in the form
of the AppleTV+ series /Dickinson/ (2019) and the Hollywood film
/Emily/ (2022). It is partly the need to correct these serious crimes
against culture and history that I have initiated this whole
Wuthering.UK effort.

Both /Dickinson/ and /Emily/ are completely cringe unwatchable, but
worse by far is the all but demonic inhabitation of Emily Dickinson
unfolding in the three-season, thirty episode AppleTV+ series
/Dickinson/. Apparently, the real Amherst Emily said something
affectionate in a letter to a female friend---which opened the door
for screenwriter Alena Smith to reinvent the shy, gentle, reclusive,
homebody, proto-nerd-girl Emily Elizabeth as a brassy, braying,
bratty, boorish, snarky, completely desensitised, masculinised,
outta-control, hyper-sexual protest-lesbian victim martyr. And so this
filth and inanity, this period porn, this cultural hooliganism went on
for three years, spread over thirty episodes of crashing, crypto-rebel
poser effrontery, even winning a Peabody, among other, "awards." As the
wincing Wikipedia article, which categorises it as a "comic-drama,"
(sic) says

#+begin_quote
/Dickinson/ is notable for its use of anachronisms, incorporating
modern language, music, and references into its portrayal of
historical events and figures.
#+end_quote

...quite possibly the understatement of all time. It also states
/Dickinson/ is "a window into the cultural and political climate of
the time."  Really. It is nothing of the sort, rather, a whole-cloth
reinvention based on radical, male-hating, misanthropic,
twenty-first-century agitprop feminism, full stop. If conspiracy
theories about "cultural Marxism" were ever to be taken serious, this
would be Exhibit A.[fn:88]

#+end_export

More innocuous perhaps, simply because it is a single film lasting
only two hours thus not able to get up to as much inanity as
/Dickinson/, is the Hollywood /Emily/.[fn:89] This train wreck depicts
Haworth Emily, the woman I consider the greatest, deepest
English-language poet, as a clumsy, oafish maladroit, stumbling around
in a completely anachronistic period fantasy chaos. Enough said.

I hemmed and hawed over this bit of electron savagery directly above,
but seriously, there can be /zero/ buy-in to this sort of nonsense if
we are to get anywhere near understanding the true nature of these
special people.

Indeed, modern leftist polemicists are forever latching onto some
defenceless figure in the past to reimagine as their pet visionary
radicals. And so any gifted unicorn from yesteryear who might have the
least bit chafed at society's eternal(ly shifting, reforming)
containment fields is available for reintroduction reconstitution as
some modern hack's proto-revolutionist. Sad.

Contrast with the 2011 /Jane Eyre/ where the modernist triumphalist
nonsense is kept to a minimum. In this umpteenth filming of the
Charlotte Brontë classic, there are two actual prayer scenes!

Of course the audio-visual medium of
film is fraught

First and foremost, we must accept the social-political landscape of
those times. 

Christianity simply was a given in both of their lives. It was their
metaphysical foundation and was largely accepted by both Emilies, in
fact, often poetised.



Today we shamble about in a political fog that will have the Left not
wanting to believe anything good about the past, and the Right not
brooking anything bad about some golden era in their imaginations. The
Left is arguably everything Noam Chomsky had bad to say about French
intellectualism, now conveniently packaged as /cultural Marxism/, and
the Right an amalgamation of conservative and, newly,
libertarianism.[fn:90]

To understand my principals we must suspend any and all revisionist
wishful thinking.


** Grand Marais, my sepulchre by the sea?

One of my earliest brushes with Dostoevski's /presence of eternal
harmoy/ came to me on a Halloween night back when I was a little boy
in a small Southern Illinois town. We were trick-or-treating on our
street, the oldest neighborhood in town with Victorians, cobblestone,
and gas streetlights. At some point I felt like I had left the present
and entered another dimension, a nighttime fairy forest of bare
trees. Everything was magical, and yet as a child not completely
disabused of magic, I didn't think anything was too out of the
ordinary. I distinctly remember looking up into the dense, bare
branches of a huge old oak and seeing the moon looking in and out of
crossing clouds and feeling like I was a spirit entered another
world. 

I live in the far-northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called North
Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, just before the
Canadian border. This so-called "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region][Arrowhead Region]]" holds some three
million-plus acres of wilderness on the shores of the world's largest
body (by surface area) of freshwater. And to my mind, this is a very
Dark Muse kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, I cannot
go. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but our Dark vibe here
must be experienced to be really appreciated. And I still see this
other world of shadow and magic as I often look out at my moonlit
/Inland Sea/ over the treetops of dark spruce and gnarled, bare
aspen.

Again, I'm wont to call Lake Superior the /Inland Sea/,[fn:91] thus,
North Coast instead of North Shore. Indeed, she is so much more
sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is something much
smaller and much friendlier. The Inland Sea is big and often violent
like any sea or ocean of saltwater. She's no simple lake for
beer-and-brats picnickers, windsurfers, speedboat and jet ski
riffraff[fn:92]. To be sure, she has a mighty présence, often dark and
moody if not threatening.

Often a deep moodiness prevails. Here is nothing really spectacular in
the sense of the Great Outdoors overwhelming with one postcard vista
after another---as we think of the American West and Alaska. Rather,
here is more subtlety, more reserve, thus more mood.

Though I feel quite alone here in this assessment. My little village,
Grand Marais, the county seat, is only some thirteen hundred
souls. And yet as the years go by we are becoming evermore
suburban-like in mentality. Being a popular Northern Midwest resort
town, we have a steady stream of newcomers who increasingly are not
adapting to small-town life; instead, maintaining their aloof,
disengaged, emotionally unavailable, blinkered urban-suburban ways. So
often one encounters another supposed fellow human---only to receive
the "you don't exist" treatment common on a street in Manhattan.

Another social-psychology pitfall is how many people came up from a
Chicago or especially Twin Cities suburb ostensibly to reinvent
themselves. They've made the leap out of the sterile, soulless
clone-bunny suburbia to now be some new version of themselves. They
typically use Hemingway and Jack London, i.e., a macho attitude about
wilderness and what I call this /Neo-Klondikism/. This is totally
different from the real pioneers of late nineteenth, early twentieth
centuries who brought Victorian civilization to the wilderness.

Because the spectacular is mostly blazingly lit, our dearth of
spectacular allows the night to come up alongside.

Grand Marais is my "sepulchre by the sea."

Here's a few lines I once wrote after a late-autumn hike

#+begin_quote
Mists race westward through the surrounding spruce forest. The entire ridge enveloped in snow clouds, light failing, the Western Hemisphere’s greatest inland sea—four miles South and seven-hundred feet below—totally obscured. Sleet falls fast and hard, stinging my face; my eyes cannot fully focus; though I hear the wind through the coated trees, the distant sound of the invisible waves, crashing angrily against the rocks. . . . I have come the four miles from the town, up the wet, slippery trail, up through the darkening forest, to pay homage to this late autumn wonderland. The Dark Muse is strong.
	I, the Modern, wear a Gore-tex jacket, over a Merino wool top, over a silk base layer. I wear black lycra tights, thin gloves with padded biking gloves on top in case of a fall. I wear special minimalist moccasins made to simulate barefoot running. I am out to face the age-old elements hiding behind modern accoutrements.
	I had contemplated walking rather than running, but no, darkness was too near and I had to reach the ridge-top ere dusk. I saw not a soul as I climbed the trail. I stopped at the ridge’s two main streams to witness their loud and clear coursing from all the new precipitation.
	It was all but dark when I set off from the cloud-bound ridge-top for the town again. The snow was accumulating in earnest, making downhill footing difficult. But as I say, the Muse was strong, and the growing darkness made it all the stronger.

Quietude and contemplation in a place far from civilization.

** /My background/

** About the name Wuthering.UK

* Footnotes

[fn:1] /muse/: Originally any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts; /or/ a state of
deep thought or abstraction, e.g., to enter a /muse/ over a poem; /or/
a source of inspiration, e.g., /Jane Austen is my muse/.

[fn:2] ...e.g., Lady Honoria Dedlock's death at the graveyard in
Dickens' /Bleak House/.

[fn:3] Quick preliminary, much more later: The term Romanticism
followed a twisted path beginning with the Latin /romant/, or, "in the
Roman manner", thus, not at all our current use of the word as a
synonym of love. In general bundling what I'm trying to get at as
Romanticism is fraught to say the least. Lots more as we go...

[fn:4] One very important principal, the German poet [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novalis][Novalis]] (penname
for Baron Friedrich von Hardenberg), often used his unique /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_fragment][fragment]]/
style to describe his Dark Muse. And so he abandoned even lyrical
poetry to get even more bursty, more spontaneous in order to capture
the subtleties of his impressions. Lot more about Novalis, the
presumed founder of German Romanticism below.

[fn:5] It is almost as if principal poetess Emily Dickinson used words
to mercilessly expose just how tenuous words really are. We'll see her
wicked flights into thoughts behind thoughts.

[fn:6] ...described [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture][here]] as well as anywhere. \\
[[file:images/RyderBeetlejuice.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:7] Allow me German noun capitalisation for poetic emphasis.

[fn:8] As philosopher and psychologist John Vervaeke said in
describing the modern crisis of anxiety and dysphoria, "Horror is the
/aesthetic/ of when you feel like you're losing your grip on reality."
Nothing to gain with horror memes. Not going there...

[fn:9] Indeed, /sublimity/. More on Edmund Burke's (as well as
Bertrand Russell's) false, "they don't get it at all" tedium on
/sublimity/ later. In short, /sublime/ is what we may find beyond mere
beauty, touching what Dostoevsky is saying here: /There are seconds,
they only come five or six at a time, and you suddenly feel the
*presence of eternal harmony* (POEH) fully achieved. It is nothing
earthly; not that it is heavenly, but man cannot endure it in his
earthly state. One must change physically or die. The feeling is clear
and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense the whole of nature and
suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not tenderheartedness, but
simply joy./ ... Perhaps awe instead of joy? Again, much more fleshing
out as we go along...

[fn:10] ...while so much of our modern poetry is screed doggerel. For
example, Allen Ginsberg acclaimed /Howl/ is really social-political
pamphleteering in verse, not true poetry as it has been known for
centuries. And from there things go downhill fast---into the most
ridiculous absurdist nihilist nonsense.

[fn:11] ...perhaps by one of my Victorian Era-heavy schoolmarms?

[fn:12] Oddly enough, I've never read her /Wuthering Heights/ and do
not intend to. (More about why later.) However, her poetry I read
continually, discovering new things, gleaning deeper insights each
time. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB][here]] for a quick biography.  \\
[[file:images/Emily_Brontë_by_Patrick_Branwell_Brontë_restored.jpg]] \\

[fn:13] See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Rossetti][here]] for a bio. She is considered by many Britain's
most prolific poet. \\
[[file:images/RossettiAge16.jpg]] \\

[fn:14] Yes, poems, as the Dark Muse seems to find its best, most
concentrated expression through poetry. Much more on why mainly poetry
delivers the ineffable of darkness later.

[fn:15] Go [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow][here]] for a quick biography. HWL was not typically Dark,
rather, a popular "uplifting" poet with a big audience. That's what
makes this selection so unique for me.

[fn:16] Dark as a teacher. The German poet Novalis, whom we'll meet
later, described in exceptionally moving poetic terms the night as a
soother and healer.

[fn:17] /modus vivendi/: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, /or/ (literally) a way of living.

[fn:18] Doom as unforeseen consequences of previous actions, which in
turn, entropically snowball into indebtedness, tragedy, and ruin;
typically multi-generational, a punishment that never seems to fit the
original crime---if it was a crime at all. The German word for doom is
/Untergang/, which also means /downfall/.

[fn:19] Queen Victoria in mourning black ca. 1862. \\
[[file:images/QueenVictoriaInMourningBlack.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:20] Is there anything worse than the so-called /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief][five stages of
grief]]/ or the Kübler-Ross model? Grief as an emotional malfunction
to be systematically reduced, fixed, corrected? Alas.

[fn:21] Lots more about my novel as we go.

[fn:22] See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson][here]] for a quick biography. \\
[[file:images/EmilyDickinson.png]]
\\
\\

[fn:23] In the third line, /Heft/ means weight, heaviness; importance,
influence; /or/ (archaic) the greater part or bulk of something.

[fn:24] Again, Dickinson often employed the capitalising of nouns for
poetic emphasis.

[fn:25] My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson is based on
their towns of origin --- Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.

[fn:26] Deep indoors deep in the forest... \\
[[file:images/MaxIndoorsOutdoorsGradient.png]] \\
\\

[fn:27] Is it not ironic how nearly all lifeforms that attempt to
share our human environments uninvited are considered invasive,
noxious vermin, pests to which we have developed almost hysterical
revulsion?

[fn:28] However cotton was rapidly becoming a global commodity, both
cotton and wool fabrics eventually being produced in steam-powered
factories as the Industrial Age reached its inflexion point of growth.

[fn:29] In any modern (non-organic Amazon Whole Foods-style)
supermarket I'm sure less that 1% of the food items come from a truly
local source. Nearly everything is shipped in from often far afar.

[fn:30] ...e.g., what is a flower garden but a derivative, a mock-up
of an original place out in the wilds, albeit with the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits left, weeded out?

[fn:31] How often is a Shakespeare character out communing with
nature? Never?...

[fn:32] Churches were typically built in the centre of a town or city
on the highest ground. I once heard that to this day no building in
Vienna may be built taller than the tower of St. Stephen's Cathedral.

[fn:33] ...with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as a leading
style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
"revivalist-nostalgic" (Greek, Gothic, Italianate, Elizabethan, Queen
Anne, etc.), perhaps a hearkening back to times more integrated with
nature, with shallower gradients between indoors and outdoors?

[fn:34] Adaptability leading to, A) a permanent (beneficial)
alteration, or B) a temporary adjustment, allowance for
less-that-optimal conditions, supposing an eventual return to optimal
conditions. We humans, I contend, are B-adaptable. This means we are
certainly no barometer species or "canary in the coal mine" of our own
well-being. We routinely ignore our fellow canary-like humans,
allowing them to suffer and die, their warnings unheeded.

[fn:35] Human population grew 60% between 1800 and 1900, and /260%/
between 1900 and 2000.

[fn:36] Modern human narratives come at us as thousands upon thousands
of fictional novels, films, plays, while aboriginal peoples had myth
and legends timeless and unchanging. That alone...

[fn:37] Is our relatively gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog][boiling frog]] metaphor?

[fn:38] What became of Wordsworth's /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45560/to-a-highland-girl][To a Highland Girl]]/ shepherdess
when she and her family were forced into an industrial urban slum? We
can only hope she and her kin are in a better place now...

[fn:39] In those days wild, untouched places were often referred to as
wastelands.

[fn:40] What is generally acknowledged as a clear breakthrough was
John Snow's tracing of the London cholera outbreak of 1854 back to
certain London neighborhood publich wells. This was strong proof of
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease][contagion theory]]. However, it wasn't until the late nineteenth
century that Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur established the field of
bacteriology and our modern scientific understanding of microscopic
pathogens developed.

[fn:41] Couple this mechanistic "death as malfunction" with atheist
nihilism to arrive at a completely soulless mechanical universe
realism dumpster fire.

[fn:42] For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are---outside of war and homicidal aggression---all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.

[fn:43] Consider [[https://youtu.be/SMNGhPgCKzw?si=L4HFHQuUTnP3j8I6][this quite tolerable goth version]] of the classic rock
song. Had this been written in Brontëan times, it would have been no
cheap, sentimental gimmick.

[fn:44] Consider the commonplace heart pacemaker, a device that
literally overrides the human heart with artificial electronic pulses.

[fn:45] Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.

[fn:46] Anne Brontë's grave in Scarborough \\
[[file:images/AnneBrontesGrave2.png]]
\\
\\
Perhaps watch [[https://youtu.be/_yzBEP3Qyvc?si=QBkrGikYxWP7C9eN][this]] on Anne's last days in Scarborough.

[fn:47] ...quoted from the third volume, /Fragmente/, of /Novalis:
Werke, Briefe, Dokumente/; Verlag Lambert Schneider; 1957.

[fn:48] Allow me the abbreviation /HTTN/ from here on.

[fn:49] /Magnificent Rebels, The First Romantics and the Invention of
the Self/  by Andrea Wulf; 2022; Vintage Books. More about this flawed
account shortly.

[fn:50] See the Wikipedia explanation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism][Romanticism]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Romanticism][German
Romanticism]]. They're as stiff and ultimately as clueless as any...

[fn:51] But /HTTN/ wasn't that new after all. Soon will be discussed
similar things from the previous eighteenth century.

[fn:52] Try [[https://www.george-macdonald.com/etexts/hymns_to_night.html][this George MacDonald translation]] as found in a
publication from 1897. Amazing how obscure unknown the keynote address
to the whole Romanticism convention has been. I'll try at a better,
annotated version soon.

[fn:53] Yes, give Wulf's /Magnificent Rebels/ a shot. But you'll
quickly realise she is more like a journalist gossiping about the
celebrities than someone who understands what they did. For all
intents and purposes, she might as well be describing Andy Warhol's
/Factory/. She is just more evidence that academe doesn't get
Romanticism, especially my dark corner thereof.

[fn:54] ...however /LB/ is bereft of Dark, although Nature is spot-on
romanticised.

[fn:55] *penetralium*: (plural /penetralia/) the innermost (or most
secret) part of a building; an inner sanctum; a sanctum sanctorum.

[fn:56] *verisimilar*: having the appearance of truth.

[fn:57] [[https://youtu.be/bASfrZYnkvI?si=JKGP2LiHgOj-h9oL][Here]] is the scene from the bio-pic /Bright Star/.

[fn:58] /The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature's Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work/ by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.

[fn:59] Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven't noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats' primary food sources.

[fn:60] A stay in Belgium to learn French and a short-lived gig in
nearby Halifax as a governess.

[fn:61] We consume upwards of one hundred times the resources and
energy per capita as did one of our European ancestors from
1800 ... and so the bigger the dance floor, the crazier the dancing.

[fn:62] There is nothing really otherworldly Dark or Romanticist as I
know it about Jane Austen, sadly. She was seemingly devoid,
non-pursuant of Dostoyevski's POEH. Although she once did say,
"Pictures of perfection, as you know, make me sick and wicked."
(Letter to her niece Fanny Knight, 23 March 1817.)

[fn:63] From my 1853 copy \\
[[file:images/NightThoughtsBook2.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:64] ...that is, in an past age not exposed to the science of
modern public relations. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays][this]] about Edward Bernays and the birth
of modern advertising and public relations. TL;DR: Since Bernays, no
"movement" in our modern times can be considered natural and organic,
rather, the result of somebody's public relations campaign.

[fn:65] For example, Germany has long been referred to as the land of
/poets/ and /thinkers/ (/Das Land der Dichter und
Denker/). Intentionally absent is novelists. Although now novelists
count as part of /die Belletristik/, i.e., /schöngeistige Literatur/
or aesthetic literature.

[fn:66] Two terms, /novel/ (English) and /roman/ (French, German,
etc. from the adjectival /Roman/, /Roman-like/) came to describe any
long-form prose story-telling.

[fn:67] Ironically, the /Novella/, a long short-story format with no
chapter breaks, was better tolerated in Germany.

[fn:68] One giveaway is /gothic/ in the title. Perhaps read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction][this
overview]] of Gothic fiction.

[fn:69] Walpole initially claimed /Otranto/ to be a medieval
manuscript he had discovered and translated, when all along it had
been his own creation.

[fn:70] ...although this is ironic since the actual label Gothic had
been used pejoratively in the Renaissance alluding to the
destructive barbarian Goths.

[fn:71] A model woebegone gothic novel heroine (from /El Mundo
ilustrado/; 1879). \\
[[file:images/VictorianWomanOnBeach_side.png]] \\
\\

[fn:72] Once asked why his horror films were so popular, Alfred
Hitchcock said the man on the street likes to occasionally dip his toe
in the lake of horror.

[fn:73] ...although Wordsworth would later mention Barbauld and
/Meditation/ as inspirational.

[fn:74] ...e.g., we would never have known Emily Brontë's poetry had
not sister Charlotte pilfered her manuscripts from their hiding place
and published them without her sister's permission. Similarly, the
reclusive Emily Dickinson only half-heartedly ever sought
publication. But after her death /thousands/ of poems were discovered
in her room.

[fn:75] Academe typically fences the Romantic Era in between 1800
and 1850.

[fn:76] ...e.g., the Brontës were pastor's daughters in rural West
Yorkshire with little exposure to (taint from?) the cultural and
literary buzz of the cities.

[fn:77] One hot mess is the [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0144q90/episodes/guide][BBC's series on Romanticism]]. (Catch it on
YouTube under /The Romantics: [[https://youtu.be/oLwRXlSgiSQ?si=y4a1MQek8Ac0pkyJ][Liberty]], [[https://youtu.be/liVQ21KZfOI?si=GpsPOUfS_l6w6r8_][Nature]], [[https://youtu.be/R6mefXs5h9o?si=c-cJk0fKTneunPZH][Eternity]])/. And then
Bertrand Russell in his severe, left-brained /The History of Western
Philosophy/ mangles away at Romanticism in his consummate pedantic
way. These are Exhibit A1/A2 of people who don't get it but must sound
important erudite. More palatable perhaps is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIffazJIrLo&list=PLhP9EhPApKE_9uxkmfSIt2JJK6oKbXmd-&pp=iAQB][Isaiah Berlin's 1965
lectures on Romanticism]].

[fn:78] The best ideas about left/right brain are those of Iain
McGilchrist. Try [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK7XG3t2nFg&list=PLqBHk3itxyPDKFnwj8-SmlwHra64cCrky&pp=iAQB][these]].

[fn:79] [[https://engines.egr.uh.edu/english-romanticism/what-romanticism][This]] will save you some googling. Note again the tortured
origin of the term /romantic/.

[fn:80] For what it's worth, German Romanticism can be broken down
into Jena, Heidelberg, then Berlin Romanticism...

[fn:81] Must again mention Christina Wulf's non-fiction tome
/Magnificent Rebels/ as Exhibit A of how the describers and explainers
just did not get it. Wulf's detailed description of the "Jena Set"
sounds similar to accounts of Andy Warhol's /Factory/ and its bipolar
crowd.

[fn:82] Daguerreotype of Poe 1849 \\
[[file:images/Edgar_Allan_Poe,_circa_1849,_restored,_squared_off.jpg]]

[fn:83] ...salon lions ... ironic German sarcasm, indeed.

\\

[fn:85] /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_homini_lupus][Man is a wolf to man]]/.

[fn:86] The typical middle-class industrialist coming up during the
Enlightenment was a pragmatic utilitarian who, after absorbing the
message of Adam Smith's /The Wealth of Nations/ (1776), had jettisoned
the baggage of noblesse oblige, the New Testament beatitudes, and any
lingering other-century nostalgia and sentimentality to forge ahead as
the consummate self-reliant individualist laser-focused on financial
wealth. These men projected a stripped-down emotional psychological
persona, indeed, a new desensitisation regime.

[fn:87] Again, let's forget her book /Wuthering Heights/, which for me
is just gothic novel handle-cranking, however artistically potent. As
before, I suspect an inevitable inability for prose to do what poetry
does. Likewise, Poe lost much altitude when he would switch from
poetry to prose. That is to say, Brontë and Poe said deep and lasting
things in their verse, but simply added pulp to the gothic novel shelf
with their prose.

[fn:88] Not only is Emily Dickinson trashed, they trash other big
names of the American Romantic Era. Try [[https://youtu.be/3tO8ol9j34s?si=DQifICJs3tJgpi9O][this]], then
[[https://youtu.be/LmneLDB6hAI?si=sSef_hvjshiTbV1b][this]]. Crrringe... And just when you thought it couldn't get worse,
[[https://youtu.be/pFp05alGLow?si=tTk-5CPhmpdkeQ3R][this music videos]] by the actress portraying Emily Dickinson is
attached to the series as its supposed theme song. Alas...

[fn:89] Emily Brontë as a modern "cottagecore emo girl" per [[https://slate.com/culture/2023/02/emily-bronte-movie-true-story-wuthering-heights.html][this]] Slate

[[file:images/Emily2022.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:90] I contend libertarianism is simply a new form of liberalism,
i.e., liberalism has gotten so big that leftism no longer is big
enough to contain it all.

[fn:91] Really though, calling it /Lake/ Superior is
like calling Einstein a high school graduate.

[fn:92] Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her longer than
ten minutes can lead to hypothermia ... at least on the North
Coast. Though the south beaches of Wisconsin and Michigan can be
swimmable in the height of summer.

[fn:94] ...lots more below...

[fn:93] If academe doesn't get my Haworth Emily, Hollywood is even
more of a clueless ignoramus.
