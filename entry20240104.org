** To begin

Light snow drifts gently down from low clouds draped over a misty
boreal forest. Deer in their grey winter coats process through the fir
and spruce. Ravens and crows dolefully croak and caw back and
forth. And I burn a daytime candle. Such an ambience to convey my
thoughts, my /feelings/ about my /Dark Muse/[fn:1].

Do you have an affinity for things on the gloomy side?  Do you find
dreamy what they find dreary ... like when an overcast day brings on a
strangely sanguine melancholy ... or a stormy night is magnificent in
a frightening and thrilling sort of way? Is twilight like a strange
reprieve freeing your senses /and/ deepening your thoughts? Perhaps
you've paused to gaze transfixed upon an old, abandoned cemetery, or a
lonely, nondescript landscape. And of course you are somewhere between
panic and nausea when others are attempting to impose happy-clappy,
sunny-cheery. You prefer candlelight over artificial light, old
architecture over new, the genial disorder of wild nature over the
forced order of gardens. If you do live in a city, you gravitate to
the "old town." Spectacular gets dull quick, but all things subtle and
veiled are magnetic. And wouldn't it be grand if every month (or
week!) we celebrated Halloween? If yes to any of this, you might
understand what I'm trying to say here.

The Dark Muse cannot be explained or contained or located with logic
or rationalism. I might say it is /feeling behind feeling/, largely
resistant of description---other than by my two favourite adjectives
/subtle/ and /sublime/.[fn:2] The Dark Muse as I mean it was best
presented by certain principle poets of the nineteenth-century
Romantic Era.[fn:3] Academe summarises Romanticism as a backlash to
the rational-logic determinism of the Enlightenment.[fn:4] ... while
the Dark Muse was an emergent property, a very special private corner
of this ultimately misunderstood time. And so this report will rely
heavily on the examples of the great Romantic Era movers of Dark Muse.

** Adding an extra wagon to the goth train

Of course I have an affinity with and feel a kinship to the modern
goth subculture.[fn:5] And yet it is one of the elephants I must shift
from the centre of the room. In very short, I believe modern goths
surely /sense/ Dark[fn:6], but for whatever reasons only want to
express it, explore it very narrowly through goth music and
fashion. My Dark Muse would hopefully include, be akin to what is
today called goth and gothic, /but I must go deeper and more
elemental/. And so I hope to speak to your "inner goth."

There is a /natural darkness/, the fathomless darkness nature
provides. Contrast this with human-made dark, the symbolism, the
artefacts, the icons with which we attempt to emulate, decorate,
magnify natural Dark. But so often these attempts are overstated,
overwrought. And so I must reject all the /gothic/ horror fright
memes, e.g., vampires, witches, demons; mean, nasty, menacing this,
campy, threatening, evil that. Right up front: My version of Dark is,
as I say, capitalised, and not meant to shock or frighten, rather,
invite and enrich. My Dark Muse contains nothing cruel nor evil nor
sinister nor satanic[fn:7]. Not the /Star Wars/ "dark side," not dark
barbarism à la /Heart of Darkness/, and not the psychic dark described
by Freud or Jung. I'm after something more subtle, discriminating, and
inward-personal. *My Dark is about the sublime,* sublimity being the
next step beyond beauty into Dostoevsky's POEH. And so I hearken back to a golden era when
Dark was the cultural currency, to be sure, the early nineteenth
century, a time when key poets (e.g. Poe, the Brontës) showed us how
triste and Stygian can be so very subtle and sublime. I'm after
something I will not outgrow, rather, be my raison d'être sustaining
me to my grave. And so I say there must be no "aging out of the scene"
as I fear often happens with modern goth. Rather, the Dark Muse should
be a deepening and widening and transcendence for one's entire life.

Another ox gored is my rejection of modern dumbed-down American street
English, which has permeated modern society---virtually
worldwide. Basically, I mean to sound more erudite, sophisticated,
intellectual with my take on past-century British-feeling
English. Why?  Simply because the English of the early-nineteenth
century was like a thoroughbred race horse, sleek and powerful and
capable of amazingly deep and expressive things; whilst modern
American street English is beggared, destitute, impoverished and
requires a buy-in to a particularly base, ignorant, crude and
aggressive hipster Zeitgeist. Which I repudiate, not going
there---although I'm sure I will occasionally slip up. Back in the day
people were more genteel, thoughtful, fine-spoken. Indeed, back when
having character and honour was a thing. Their poetry, for instance,
could express the depths and heights of human thought and
sensitivities.[fn:8] In past centuries they understood the human need
for holiness, grandeur, the epic and eternal. Compare this with the
modernists we see everywhere today who believe being coarse, crass,
base, irreverent---and arrogant about it---is somehow progress... But
on the other hand, it might just be that I've finally succumbed to the
influence of all those schoolmarms back in my distant childhood who
made us read, e.g., Shakespeare, holding up "wordy," other-century
English as superior. Mrs Mugwortlawny was right, you know. And yes,
I'll occasionally drop foreign as well as Latin words and phrases, my
foreign language being German... You have been warned.

** Dark like me?

For me life seems empty, insipid, weak without a strong current of the
Dark Muse. It's as if life cannot be properly understood without the
dark perspective. But is this nature or nurture? Am I innately so, or
have I been acculturated?[fn:9] A quick litmus test. I present here a short,
simple poem from my main darkness benefactress, the poetess who stands
at the centre of everything I mean to say about dark, namely, Emily
Jane Brontë. [fn:10]

#+begin_verse
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse

Here EB is direct, blunt even. But now we know. Either she speaks to
something in you, or you are part of the majority who finds it---weird,
abnormal, morbid, overwrought, puerile, even sick or evil. To be sure,
my dark /penchant/ gets mostly deer-in-headlights responses, if not
outright hostility. The openly hostile see my dark druthers as morose,
morbid, as "wallowing in self-pity" or "dwelling on the negative." I
beg to differ...

Here is something a bit lighter but the same basic idea from
/Christina Rossetti/ [fn:11]

#+begin_verse
Fade tender lily,
Fade O crimson rose,
Fade every flower
Sweetest flower that blows.

Go chilly Autumn,
Come O Winter cold;
Let the green things die away
Into common mould.

Birth follows hard on death,
Life on withering:
Hasten, we shall come the sooner
Back to pleasant Spring.
#+end_verse

Rossetti would carefully exposit a dark fatalism, ending with hope
bound in humble expectancy. I like to think these two English
poetesses are expressing an informed, matured melancholy that bespeaks
a deeper understanding of life.

And another poem,[fn:12] here Longfellow's /Snow-flakes/ from a
collection published in 1863

#+begin_verse
Out of the bosom of the Air,
      Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,
Over the woodlands brown and bare,
      Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
            Silent, and soft, and slow
            Descends the snow.

Even as our cloudy fancies take
      Suddenly shape in some divine expression,
Even as the troubled heart doth make
      In the white countenance confession,
            The troubled sky reveals
            The grief it feels.

This is the poem of the air,
      Slowly in silent syllables recorded;
This is the secret of despair,
      Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,
            Now whispered and revealed
            To wood and field.
#+end_verse

Here I see Longfellow[fn:13] looking to the natural world and
/poetising/[fn:14], to be sure, /darkly/. As a result, agents of
mental affliction and depression---despair, grief, misery---are
transformed into more equanimous states of sadness and melancholy
hopefully reaching a higher emotional maturity. In some paradoxical
way, nature and darkness as witnesses eventually become healers ... as
if the initial agony and sorrow are a ravaging cancer or virus that
eventually fade into remission, but can never entirely be eliminated
whilst on Earth.

This /poetising/ of nature dark and mystical was the modus operandi of
my select nineteenth-century poets[fn:15]. Rather than avoid, they
/embraced the dark/, something we today in our brightly-lit,
cordoned-off world might consider counter-intuitive, if not
wrong-headed. I contend we have lost this subtle art of moving
hardship, tragedy, emotional crises into a stasis remission
melancholy. Too often we are failures at finding a /modus
vivendi/[fn:16] with the trials and tribulations of life as our
ancestors once did.

Surely we suffer poorly. Again, all we may ever do is usher the
initially searing, inescapable pain to a dull ache in the backdrop of
time. Though I would say this was better understood in the past than
today. They did not attempt to contain, disguise, systematise, or
/process/ greif, rather, greif was faced directly, pain was shared,
empathy a way of life. And so emotional space was allotted, support
was communal, organic, and natural. Strikingly different from today
was their acceptance of doom and fate, two concepts antithetical to
our dynamic, positivist, self-determining, fix-everthing-quickly
modern attitudes.

Consider Queen Victoria[fn:17] who wore mourning black from the time
of her husband Prince Albert's death in 1861 till the end of her life
in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg who upon losing her husband
Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. In those days death was properly, officially mourned. No one
chivvied mourners along with their grief and sadness. Contrast this
with today's all-too-prevalent disassociation, the confused,
disorganised quasi-denial and suppression we moderns show towards
death[fn:18]. For the early nineteenth century, poetising life's train
of tragedy was depression deconstruction as a life skill. The slings
and arrows of human existence found conjunction with /nature/,
/darkness/, and /faith/ through poetry, thereby highlighting,
elevating our uniquely human experience on Earth, casting a gossamer
of sublimity over our natural existence like no other generation
before or since. Theirs was the deepest exploration of our true
humanness that I know, and, thus, something I must pursue.

** But why Dark?

But still, why Dark? Dark speaks to me, but, again, why? Lack
of a clear and simple answer forces a wordier one. Dark remains
mysterious---no matter how I try to imbibe or express it. Dark is
something instinctual, cathartic, evocative, centring for me. Dark is
more than the lack of light. Dark can lead the imagination to
riot. The moss, lichens, and mushrooms in the secretive shadows of the
forest incite so much more than the spectacular sunny vista across the
forest valley. The fresh-cut rose elicits one response, but the faded
rose another---deeper but for me never dysphoric. Here is something
from my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/[fn:19]

#+begin_quote
The new cut rose: Initially beautiful, thereafter dried and
desiccated, lost forever its initial beauty and fragrance. Once
affording a glimpse of perfection, only reminiscent thereafter. Beauty
always some fleeting illusion or madness? Moreover its eclipse,
joining, leading the shadows of our relentless doom, our march to the
grave. And though I live in this momentary brilliance, I still search
my night shore; for until now I have known only of beauty’s haunting
rumour, of love’s promise, those slightest quickenings of things
necessarily rare and formerly peripheral. Yes, in this moment I may
have some of love’s bliss, but I know I will cherish with a larger,
more mature heart the memory thereof, an echo sent down life’s long,
clouded memory hall as the true and lasting blessing.
#+end_quote

Yes, there might have been a dinner invite for me back in the day... 

Let's see another example of get-it-or-don't, this time a poem from
Emily Elizabeth Dickinson[fn:20] of Amherst, Massachusetts,
her /There's a certain slant of light/[fn:21]

#+begin_verse
There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons — 
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes — 

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us — 
We can find no scar, 
But internal difference — 
Where the Meanings, are — 

None may teach it – Any — 
'Tis the seal Despair — 
An imperial affliction 
Sent us of the Air — 

When it comes, the Landscape listens — 
Shadows – hold their breath — 
When it goes, 'tis like the Distance 
On the look of Death — 
#+end_verse

Indeed. That last line includes /Death/ capitalised[fn:22]. Now I must
emphasise these nineteenth-century artists understood death much
differently than we do today. Unfortunately, this capitalised,
past-century view of Death has become opaque, lost. I hope to
rediscover it. I'll start by stating their understanding of Death was
integral to their understanding of nature...

** Nature and Death in the nineteenth century

/The main points being:/
+ True nature is /birth, growth, deterioration, and death/, full
  stop...
+ ...ergo, /nature is not a place/, inside or out, rather, a state of
  being...
+ ...ergo, no degrees of nature, rather, nature constant ubiquitous...
+ ...ergo, death is an integral part of true nature.
+ The increasingly extra-natural, quasi-immortal modern human
+ Their direct exposure to nature dominant versus our "managing ecosystems."

I hold that our modern, twenty-first-century understanding of nature
is very different than that of early-nineteenth-century poets such as
the Haworth and Amherst Emilies[fn:23] and their contemporaries. Just
considering our indoor living environments today, a typical modern
building is more like a sealed /space station/ plopped down on a
hostile alien planet compared to the simpler, more primitive
structures of the not-so-distant past. Quite literally, the Brontës'
Haworth parsonage, built in 1778 out of local stone and wood and clay,
had more in common with human shelters from one, /two/ thousand years
previous than with our modern suburban homes only some two hundred
years later[fn:24]. Hence, /in just the past two to three hundred
years a very steep, vertical gradient or differential has grown
between indoors and outdoors/. This, in turn, has brought us to see
nature more as a /place/ separate and outside, cut off, away from our
artificial, high-tech, controlled and regulated modern indoor
spaces[fn:25] ... which, in turn, has lead us to rate /outdoors
nature/ on continua of relative wildness and remoteness from our
sealed-off, self-contained, humans-only environments.

<span class="cap">Homespun and one of its sources. Original art from Steve-Lease (DeviantArt.com)</span>@@
@@html:</span>@@

Even as late as my own childhood the term /homespun/ was in use to
indicate a poor, unsophisticated person, a country bumkin, a hick from
the sticks. The term referred to a person's clothing being homemade
from locally-sourced, hand-spun and woven materials such as linen and
wool rather than factory-made retail clothing. The early-nineteenth
century Brontëan West Yorkshire would have seen the majority of the
villagers in homespun, all but a few garments not hand-tailored
bespoke[fn:26]. And of course food was entirely from local
production. Hence, a person's daily resources were overwhelmingly
local, a small bit perhaps coming from a nearby /market town/, while
only the most exotic items (e.g., a clock) would have come from
farther away. Today, however, this supply pyramid is completely
flipped, as nearly everything comes from far (far!) away (e.g. China),
while only a few personal items would be from a local or even regional
source[fn:27]. And so in Brontëan times (first half of the 1800s) the
surrounding land was agriculturally domesticated, a working
partner. Contrast this with today's urban-suburban populations hardly
ever in contact with farmers or their farms. Nor do we know anything
about where our clothing came from. Today, nature as "the land," as
our immediate provider, has been completely abstracted into concepts
such as /ecosystems/, which implies we are now removed observers
controlling nature as if it were just another of our mechanical
objects.

No doubt we have always made a distinction between being /inside/ a
shelter and going /outside/ into the so-called /elements/. But
starting some six to ten thousand years ago we began to give up
aboriginal nomadic life and its direct daily contact with said
untamed, uncontrolled elements in order to establish permanent
city-states supported by mass monoculture agriculture. And so indoor
environments in ever-expanding urban centres became evermore
physically removed, walled off from the wild natural world, becoming
increasingly self-contained, all-encompassing, self-referencing, thus,
/recursively derivative/[fn:28].

Along with this growing separation came mentalities, narratives
increasingly based indoors and /extra-natural/ [fn:29]. Being indoors
meant we no longer were in direct contact with the nature spirits all
around; instead, praying to an extra-natural, off-world monotheistic
God in architectural showcase churches[fn:30]. Western architecture
seemed to reach a fantastical aesthetic crescendo in the Victorian
nineteenth century[fn:31], coinciding with an exponential growth in
urban population which had just passed an inflection point. Today the
steepness of our indoor-outdoor gradient has increased even more since
Victorian times ... resulting in a humanity more abstracted
/extra-natural/ than ever. How then may we, a species seemingly
capable of great adaptability[fn:32], objectively measure our
separation from nature?  What has domestic, urban, indoor living done
to our brains, our sense of belonging to the planet, to one another?
How can we even begin to trace back the many rabbit hole bifurcations,
the chain of derivatives we've taken for all these centuries down,
out, and away from /nature pure/?  To be sure, we have demonstrated a
collective will to make conditions better for us /and us alone/. We see
our dominion over, abstraction away, separation from nature as fate,
as destiny. After all, our population doubling in less than fifty
years to eight billion[fn:33] says something to our intention and
ability to dominate. And we seem to have adapted our collective human
psyche, our narratives to this separation[fn:34]. /But is this
sustainable?/ All dark musings aside, many of us today have grown
concerned over the question of sustainability, concerned about our
long arc of estrangement from nature[fn:35]. Let me suggest a
different understanding of nature, namely---

#+begin_quote
Nature is not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature is everything going on everywhere. Nature as the myriad cycles
of *birth*, *growth*, *deterioration*, and *death* happening
everywhere all the time.
#+end_quote

I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets,
knew, sensed this pre-modern meaning of nature as beyond inside or
outside. Yes, one went outside, out into the elements. But once back
indoors, a Brontë was not so completely out of and above nature's
touch, influence, /doom/ as we now fancy ourselves. Again, the cycles
of birth, growth, deterioration, and death were happening everywhere
/sans emplacement/ [fn:36]. Here again is Emily Brontë, her epic /The
night is darkening round me/

#+begin_verse
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow;
But a tyrant spell has bound me,
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;
The storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below;
But nothing drear can move me;
I will not, cannot go.
#+end_verse

Yes, she is outdoors facing the "elements," as we say. She even refers
to the wilds as "wastes" and as "drear."[fn:37] And yet she is
transfixed, frozen to the spot---and I cannot, cannot go, as she
says. Subjective terms like wastes and drear refer to the age-old
attitude towards nature as a terrible, grim, inescapable master, a
sponsor of disaster and death, hardly over which to linger, let alone
wax poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that, and to be sure,
grandeur and sublimity expressed in lines of verse was the surprising
result. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared directly at
an enemy previously known as all-powerful and unforgiving, and in so
doing she sensed something deep and personally transformative. She was
stirred to write lines that, for me at least, are the very centre of
the mystery of life, death, and the Dark Muse.

Now, contrast Brontëan nature with Hemingway's twentieth-century
nature. Hemingway went hither and yon, all over the globe to do his
macho outdoors thing. But if anything serious had happened to him he
always could have been airlifted out to receive modern medical
care. Not the Romantic Era poets who were in harm's way with no
timeouts, no escape. Would Hemingway have done all those macho-man
things if there had been no modern world with modern medical aid just
a plane ride away? Haworth Emily lived in a time when /nothing/ was
modern, i.e., her West Yorkshire moorlands were semi-wilderness and
early eighteenth-century medicine didn't even know about germs.[fn:38]
Literally, a cut on a toe could become infected resulting in death.

With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around, the last two components, deterioration and
death, must be understood beyond our mechanistic reductionist modern
take of just physical malfunction.[fn:39] Back in the day death was a
quasi-spiritual /force majeure/. But no longer thanks to modern
medicine. It's almost as if deterioration and death, two of nature's
inescapable realities, have been cordoned off---or at least placed
under much greater human control than ever before. /It's as if through
modern medicine we have begun to acquire a demi-godlike,
proto-immortal veto power over physical demise./ And with this control
we have torn down, dismantled a great component of spirituality,
namely the reckoning of one's mortality with a deity. Where once was
supposed a /mortal/, physical plane inferior an /immortal/, spiritual
plane, we now would believe only the physical plane to be
relevant. Alas...

Though for the meantime death remains an undeniable certainty. Death
comes as it always has---from old age, fatal accident, or deadly
physical aggression or predation.[fn:40] But a completely different
attitude arises when modern healthcare's labyrinth of diagnoses,
drugs, procedures and surgeries routinely thwart what was once all but
certain, as well as swift demise. And so we've begun to lessen the
mystery of Death, overturn fate, consequence, and doom.

#+begin_verse
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
--- Psalm 90:10
#+end_verse

This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalistic,
absolute inevitability so resounding as to constantly shake and echo
through life. Death as life's backstop, container, timer, combinator,
reaper.[fn:41] And so I say, as death is interrupted, so are the
greater human cycles of emotion interrupted.

Indeed, what if we start to take command of death's agenda, rerouting
death's comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is making the point that by no
means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty years of life, and even if
we get them they might not be that great. And yet we have grown to
/expect/ from the implicit promises of modern medical science a
healthy, quality seventy, eighty, ninety, or even more years. Again,
modern medicine has disrupted the two last components of a nature
ubiquitous cyclic, i.e., deterioration and death, thereby collapsing
our understanding of what true nature is. Modern science has lessened
the wallop of tragedy, weakened overall the doominess of doom by
redefining life as so much organic machine circuitry, a mechanism
that, in turn, is to be better and better repaired, maintained,
improved against entropic wear-and-tear[fn:42].

Let me relate a modern story about our new attitude towards death. My
father, who has since passed away, lost his /third/ wife to lung
cancer caused inevitably by decades of smoking[fn:43]. But instead of
accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I finally theorised that he
had explicated from all the buzz of the various possible medical
interventions---including their probabilities of success or
failure---a hope that the death sentence of lung cancer could,
/should/ be beaten by some technology lurking in some corner of the
modern medical labyrinth. Alas...

Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed death's arrival to
such an absurd degree. Human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of death able to lap over at any time. But today
the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has become an all but
guaranteed minimum. Old age and death are increasingly spoken of as
"diseases" we can and should defeat. Death as a nuisance, indeed. My
father felt cheated when that three-, fourscore and more was not
forthcoming. But as you may anticipate, I contend life is life only
with death---death absolute and not easily theorised away. And of
course, God must be somewhere in all this.

A sickly Anne Brontë[fn:44] on her final dying trip to Scarborough in
1849 had made a stop in York where she insisted on seeing the York
Minster. Upon gazing up at the great cathedral she said, "If finite
power can do this..."  But then she was overcome with emotion and fell
silent. Anne was in a deep and personal death mindset of utter and
complete humility and reverence. Indeed, God was in her death[fn:45].

** Death rises as Romanticism: Novalis

#+begin_quote
The world must be romanticised. In this way we will find again its
primal meaning. Romanticising is nothing but raising to a higher power
in a qualitative sense. In this process the lower Self becomes
identified with a better Self ... When I give a lofty meaning to the
commonplace, a mysterious prestige to the usual, the dignity of the
unknown to the known, an aura of infinity to the finite, then I am
romanticising. For the higher, the unknown, the mystical, the
infinite, the process is reversed---these are---expressed in terms of
their logarithms by such a connection---they are--reduced to familiar
terms. \\
 ---Novalis
#+end_quote

This is a quote from[fn:46] the German nobleman Friedrich Leopold
/Freiherr/ (Baron) von Hardenberg (1772---1801), aka, Novalis, who is
considered by academe to be the founder of the Romantic Movement no
less. And yet most people have never heard of Novalis. Specifically,
it was his prose-poem cycle entitled /Hymns to the Night/[fn:47] that
set people around him off. And the gathering of German intellectuals
in Jena, Thuringia, Germany, referred to as the /Jena Set/ by Andrea
Wulf in her /Magnificent Rebels/[fn:48] rallied around Novalis, and
subsequently tried to build on /Hymns/ and Novalis' romanticising
poetising. What came to be known as Jena Romanticism[fn:49] eventually
spread to eager circles and fertile grounds in Britain and the United
States.

Alas, but here is where I become quite the iconoclast, primarily by
insisting /nearly everyone has got Romanticism wrong!/ Even the actual
contemporaries around Novalis. Perhaps even Novalis himself! I posit
that Novalis with his foundational HTTN took off in a straight line
into the Dark Muse[fn:50]. Just reading HTTN, one cannot escape the
sheer intensity of Novalis' swoon-fest over Night and
Death[fn:51]. Here's a small taste

#+begin_verse
I feel the flow of
Death's youth-giving flood;
To balsam and æther, it
Changes my blood!
I live all the daytime
In faith and in might:
And in holy rapture
I die every night.
#+end_verse

and just before

#+begin_verse
What delight, what pleasure offers /thy/ life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night? Thy mother, it is she brings thee forth, and to her thou owest all thy glory.
#+end_verse

In my humble opinion, HTTN is one of the densest, purest attesting to
the Dark Muse ever. As the legend tells, his inspiration came from
being grief-stricken at the death of his fifteen-year-old fiancée
Sophie von Kühn, to whose grave he pilgrimed for one hundred
nights. The Jena Set writer Ludwig Tieck
described the teenage Sophie as

#+begin_quote
Even as a child, she gave an impression which---because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely---we must call super-earthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.
#+end_quote

HTTN is trance, vision, most certainly not just the gymnastics of
flipping the sacred to profane and profane to sacred as Novalis
describes Romanticism above. He journeyed into Dark and came back with
some of the purest Dark ever. /And this has little or nothing to do
with all the copy produced by his Jena Set friends./ Hence, this great
abyss yawning open between producers and describer-promoters.

** John Keats' sense of Beauty

Samuel Taylor Coleridge is generally accepted as the leading
intellectualiser of British Romanticism during its inception roughly
parallel to the Jena Romantic liftoff. Following is a Coleridge quote
as good as any

#+begin_quote
...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each
other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the
accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as
the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible
directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces
should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike
indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible
yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which
their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and
the process of our own self-consciousness.
#+end_quote

Indeed, such wordy intellectualisations are the usual approach for
academics scrounging for copy. Ironically, Coleridge could put aside
his explainer hat and put on his poet hat. He and Wordsworth's
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrical_Ballads][Lyrical Ballads]]/ are considered the cornerstone of English
Romanticism. However, let us contrast this with what English poet John
Keats said years later in a 1817 letter to his brothers George and
Thomas

#+begin_quote
...I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being
in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching
after fact and reason---Coleridge, for instance, would let go by a fine
isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of mystery, from
being incapable of remaining content with half-knowledge. This pursued
through volumes would perhaps take us no further than this, that with
a great poet the sense of Beauty overcomes every other consideration,
or rather obliterates all consideration.
#+end_quote

Intellectualisations, great and lengthy, especially of the
"Penetralium[fn:52] of mystery," can only become verisimilar[fn:53]
ramblings that get us nowhere, Keats is saying. But with a simple ode
to Beauty the poet obviates, obliterates intellectualisations. Keats'
/Negative Capability/ is about /cognitive dissonance/ as a great and
necessary burden the poet must carry, a process necessary for deeper
understanding beyond neat and tidy piles of logical-seeming
words. That is, to /not/ immediately intellectualise, but to hold
oneself in a counter-intuitive state of unresolved---just to see where
it might lead. Here is the famed beginning of his "poetic romance"
/Endymion/

#+begin_verse
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
#+end_verse

Take that Coleridge, you brachial babbling braincase!

In the 2009 film /Bright Star/, a touching bio-drama about
Keats, there is a scene where, speaking with his love interest Fanny
Brawne, he says /A poet is not at all poetical. In fact, he the most
unpoetical thing in existence. He has no identity. He is continually
filling some other body---the sun, the moon./ He then says, /Poetic
craft is a carcass, a sham. If poetry does not come as naturally as
leaves to a tree then it had better not come at all./ And then Fanny
says, /I still don't know how to work out a poem./ To which Keats
says,

#+begin_quote
A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving
in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the
lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not /work/ the
lake out. It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and
emboldens the soul to accept mystery.
#+end_quote

And thus, I would posit he, like I, did not see Romanticism as
something needs bundling and explaining and stuck with labels and
herded into categories. Time and time again I listen to or read a
description of Romanticism and come away with the feeling the author
understands nothing, rather, is simply stringing disparate bits and
bobs together for some logical consistency. And so I say the
intellectual prison yard in which academe has stuck Romanticism should
be opened up, the guards soundly switched and run off, the prisoners
let back out into the wide fields and deep woods.

** Thriving versus surviving; top dog versus underdog

In his book /The Genius of Instinct/ [fn:54] author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to /thrive/, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, but wait,
haven't these bats jumped /outside/ of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of /trans/-bat-ism. But is that a good thing?
In the meantime the bats profit. But for nature as a whole? In effect,
the bats have short-circuited their doom, their fate. And what are the
consequences?

Perhaps bats doing better is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis
the rest of their competitors and surrounding environment[fn:55]. And
yet what happens when a species keeps thriving more and more,
increasing its success statistics, stepping over, beyond any of the
natural restrictions that real integration and harmony with nature
would have required? *Aren't we humans Exhibit A of just such an
out-of-control species?* And so I ask, how can all this so-called
thriving be good, end well?  How can a dominant species like ours,
which seems to be always "gaming the system," evermore ingeniously and
aggressively extra-natural, not eventually have to pay some price?
Simply put, How can more and more people consuming more and more
resources and energy, each of us fantasising about success and
prosperity, not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?

Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to its tightly integrated niche, then
exponential growth ensues---which will eventually hit an inflexion
point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards an
inevitable overshoot and crash.

To my mind, Emily Brontë was just this sort of hard-pressed little bat
out in the wilds---colony-less, huddled in a hollow tree, barely eking
out a marginal life. Here is her /Plead for me/

#+begin_verse
Why I have persevered to shun
The common paths that others run;
And on a strange road journeyed on
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.

These once indeed seemed Beings divine,
And they perchance heard vows of mine
And saw my offerings on their shrine—
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,
And mine were worthily despised;

My Darling Pain that wounds and sears
And wrings a blessing out from tears
By deadening me to real cares;
And yet, a king---though prudence well
Have taught thy subject to rebel.

And am I wrong to worship where
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me
And tell why I have chosen thee!
#+end_verse

I consider this her ode to skipping the trans-human thrive scene of
her day and striking out into some Beyond to commune with her God of
Visions. Again, I must believe she was a little bat fluttering across
the semi-wilderness moorland, as true an existential /underdog/ as was
still possible back then[fn:56]. Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced
malnutrition, contaminated water, tuberculosis --- pick one, two, or
all three---five months after her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the
greater world outside of her tiny Haworth village and its surrounding
hills for a few months[fn:57]. Hers was a world with nothing modern as
we know it, e.g., a cut on a toe could lead to an infection requiring
amputation, or even worse.

And yet one might ask if her existence in the early nineteen century
was really so very wild and rugged. Was she still not observing nature
from civilization's relative place of safety, thereby rendering her
observations just as tainted, just as relative as ours today? I say
no. Clearly our modern place of safety is maximal, as we of the
twenty-first century float above cruel Nature on unprecedented levels
of modern high-tech materialism[fn:58]. Nonetheless, I contend hers
was a unique vantage point, neither too exposed nor removed
from elemental nature.

So often I am confronted with modern scoffers who would have us
believe Romantic Era poets only knew nature from picnics held at
garden-like country estates where dandies and their pampered ladies
were attended by servants, as seen in the Hollywood film version of
Jane Austen's /Emma/

#+begin_export html

or playful romps like Hollywood's latest anachronistic redo of Emily
Brontë depicting her rolling down a grassy slope in some domesticated
country setting

<span class="cap">Fictional E.B. in a silly, carefree moment tumbling down a hill</b><br>(From the 2022 film <b>Emily</b>) </span>
#+end_export

Again, for us moderns nature is a /place/, a /location/ away from and
diametrically opposite our modern interior spaces. Nature today is
seen as this vast other place, the /Great Outdoors/. Then the farther
afield from modern civilization we can go, the truer and more
authentic nature supposedly becomes. And so we create a /nature
continuum/ whereby a trackless wilderness as far from civilization as
possible is the truest nature, while hardly nature at all would be a
ditch overgrown with weeds behind one of our triple-paned windowed,
vinyl-siding-clad, forced-air-HVAC suburban houses. Nature can only be
very wild, thus, very far away from the safety of space colony
civilization. Writers like Ernest Hemingway and Jack London exploit
these fright memes of nature as a distant, exotic, hostile
place. Which is virtually identical to science fiction stories of
hostile alien planets "conquered" by brave, intrepid astronauts. To be
sure, many sci-fi depictions of alien worlds are simply off-Earth
versions of the Klondike Yukon that London described.

No, my poets of the so-called Romantic Era were not pampered dandies
and fine ladies strolling for a few odd bored minutes on manicured
estate grounds. Nor were they any sort of beneficiaries of the "Age of
Exploration" colonialism. My poets were mainly short-lived little bats
in their crevasses and corners, as beaten and confused as any bats
have ever been.

** Eighteenth-century British Dark

Though Britain was seeing Dark decades before Novalis and
Romanticism. As I do with Novalis and his HTTN, I can't help but
believe these eighteenth-century English principals were more
sleepwalkers than any sort of intentional movement leaders. First came
The /Graveyard School/ of poetry full of doom and gloom[fn:59], then
just past mid-century the gothic romance novel load on more d&g, then
by what might be called the /Night School/, which became the basis of
my Dark corner of Romanticism.[fn:60]

*** The Graveyard School

It was only a few decades into the eighteenth century when there
emerged in Britain a style of poetry which has since been named the
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_poets][Graveyard School]]/. My Exhibit A of Graveyard is Edward Young's
epic-length /[[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33156/33156-h/33156-h.htm][The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts on Life, Death, &
Immortality]]/ (or simply /Night-Thoughts/, ca. 1742-1745).[fn:61]
Bursting with a grandiosity only poetry can access, Young relentlessly
spins out darkness and doom. To be sure, he is Dark with a shudder,
full of fright memes meant to weigh down and ultimately defeat---if
taken seriously. A quick taste, s'il vous plaît

#+begin_verse
"When the cock crew, he wept”---smote by that eye
Which looks on me, on all: that Power, who bids
This midnight sentinel, with clarion shrill
(Emblem of that which shall awake the dead),
Rouse souls from slumber, into thoughts of heaven.
Shall I too weep? Where then is fortitude?
And, fortitude abandon’d, where is man?
I know the terms on which he sees the light;
He that is born, is listed; life is war;
Eternal war with woe. Who bears it best,
Deserves it least...
#+end_verse

...indeed, unrelenting doom and woe[fn:62]. Typical of Graveyard
School, there is no hope, no escape, just the weight of an assumed
curse, then processions of lamentation to cliff edges and fated
tumbling thereoff

#+begin_verse
Art, brainless Art! our furious charioteer...
...Drives headlong towards the precipice of death;
Death, most our dread; death thus more dreadful made:
Oh, what a riddle of absurdity!
#+end_verse

or

#+begin_verse
From short (as usual) and disturb’d repose,
I wake: how happy they, who wake no more!
Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave.
I wake, emerging from a sea of dreams
Tumultuous; where my wreck’d desponding thought
From wave to wave of fancied misery
At random drove...
#+end_verse

Of course every student of the Dark Muse should read Young's
/Night-thoughts/. And yet this over-the-top doom hyperbole eventually
delivers even the most indulgent reader to incredulity. At some point
it becomes farce, as when we might tell ghost stories at a social
gathering quite dramatic convincing, but then returning to
rationality, not take them seriously. Though Graveyard had a lighter
side. For example, Thomas Gray's /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44299/elegy-written-in-a-country-churchyard][Elegy Written in a Country
Churchyard]]/ (1751). To be sure, the eulogising of the dead is a much
older and well established genre, typically emphasising the qualities
of the deceased over the dark abyss his grave might represent. While
we're not meant to survive Young's world, Gray's elegy of a lost
friend is Dark and fatalist and yet reverent faithful

#+begin_verse
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.
#+end_verse

Here whatever negatives, sinister, morose, and doomy, may be swirling
about, God in his heavenly domain has our backs. We may obsess wallow
in the fatalism of mortal inevitabilities, but Gray doesn't try to
beat us down as much as did the hardcore Graveyard Schoolers. And yet
with Graveyard Britain had arrived at a public exhibition of Dark. At
some point we must ask (setting aside the amateur historical
social-psychology of academe), *Is Dark innate?* Again I ask, *Is Dark
nature or nurture?* In my humble opinion, a great movement like
Graveyard arrives unexpected, completely out of the blue, a natural,
organic collective upwelling. Which begs the question, What rises to
cultural and intellectual prominence in an age?[fn:63] Obviously,
there must be a foundation of social cohesion and integrity, a
predominance of high cultural standards for a trend to be more than
just what we see today, i.e., cultural hooliganism and opportunist,
lowest-common-denominator pablum. To be sure, many of that era
condemned gothic and Graveyard as subculture. But eventually came
refinement, which I might call the /Night School/. Though intervening
was the /gothic novel/ .

*** The arrival of the /gothic/ novel

Prose versus poetry. In the past poetry was seen in polite upper-class
circles as the higher, the preferred, acceptable form of
literature[fn:64]. Prose in the form of the novel[fn:65], on the other
hand, was not acceptable, seen as too revealing invasive personal,
i.e., it is improper, unseemly, distasteful to expose even an
imaginary person's life details in such an open and revealing
fashion. According to this attitude, it was a crude thing to so freely
fantasise human goings-on in a fictitious way. Rather, literature must
ennoble the human as a being created in the likeness of God, and not
dwell on his mundanity and failings. After all, a novel was neither
factual (e.g. a saint's hagiography) nor high lyrical poetic (e.g.,
church hymn lyrics or /Heldenlieder/). A novel/roman was simply too
plain-spoken, i.e., the unavoidable clarity (/Klartext/) inherent in
non-poeticised descriptive writing invariably generated an undesirable
ordinariness. And so it was in this mise en scène that the prose novel
bumped along post-Medieval Age as a barely tolerated corruption of
writing, as a regrettable parallel to poetry, consumed mainly by
easily excited arriviste vulgarian middle-class women. And yet as the
middle class grew in power and numbers, the novel came to
the fore, especially in the eighteenth century.[fn:66]

Modern academe considers the novel /The Castle of Otranto, A Gothic
Story/, appearing in its first edition in 1764, to be the official
start of British /gothic/ literature.[fn:67] Written by the excentric,
iconoclastic English nobleman Horace Walpole (1717 – 1797), /Otranto/
is a melodrama set in sixteenth-century Naples offering the
impressionable middle-class women of the day a big dose of darkness,
doom, and woe. Walpole's penchant for medievalism rode the always
simmering nostalgic idealisation of the Medieval Age[fn:68], while the
adjective /gothic/ referred to medieval Gothic architecture.[fn:69]
Gothic "horror" was an instant hit, and other writers and influencers
quickly joined in creating a full-on Dark movement.[fn:70]

<span class="cap">Wolf's Crag from Walter Scott's gothic <i>The Bride of Lammermore</i> </span>
#+end_export

Above is an etching from a publication of Sir Walter Scott's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_of_Lammermoor][The
Bride of Lammermore]]/ (1819). Consider the sheer visual density and
heaviness of the scene (click on the image to be taken to a larger
version). Whence, wherefore this heaviness, this portent?  Predominant
is nature dark, inhospitable, and threatening, the human-built castle
primitive, isolated, and vulnerable, the riders miniscule, exposed. It
is as if every single living cell---plant, animal, human---is clinging
to life by a thread, and any dim green and blue hues of vegetation and
sea are wholly irrelevant. The scene evokes threat, danger, dysphoria,
something horrific just waiting to transpire. But again how, why? Why
such darkness and what was (and still is) the appeal? Hitchcock
tautologies aside, modern academe has offered theories about the
socio-political-psychological landscape of the times, and yet these
"experts" only wind up sounding supercilious and patronising from
their modern triumphalist perches, as if they are searching for a
disease to explain a malady, weakness to explain indulgence. No,
indeed, Dark, even when crude and heavy, predominates, arrests,
mystifies, the appeal all the stronger for its recessive, ungraspable
spherical symmetry. To be sure, this "coming out" of gothic in the
eighteenth century was overwrought, overweight with its fright memes,
but undeniably popular and onto something real about the inner human
experience.

*** The night, the stars the moon...

As assuredly personal and original as Novalis' /Hymns to the Night/
was, Englishwoman Anna Laetitia Barbauld's /[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_(Barbauld)/A_Summer_Evening%27s_Meditation][A Summer Evening's
Meditation]]/ had already appeared in 1773 praising the night in a
similarly cherished, solemn way. Without deeper investigation I have
no real idea if Barbauld's /Meditation/ started what I'm calling the
/Night School/, but as a working theory, yes, she offered a new
perspective to Dark with an accessibility and maturity not seen in
Graveyard or gothic horror. After a nod to Young's /Night-thoughts/
with a quote therefrom, /One sun by day, by night ten thousand shine/,
Barbauld launches directly into her summer night and its canopy of
stars...

#+begin_verse
Tis past! The sultry tyrant of the south
Has spent his short-liv'd rage; more grateful hours
Move silent on; the skies no more repel
The dazzled sight, but with mild maiden beams
Of temper'd light, invite the cherish'd eye
To wander o'er their sphere; where hung aloft
Dian's bright crescent, like a silver bow
New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns
Impatient for the night, and seems to push
Her brother down the sky. Fair Venus shines
E'en in the eye of day; with sweetest beam
Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood
Of soften'd radiance from her dewy locks.
The shadows spread apace; while meeken'd Eve
Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires
Thro' the Hesperian gardens of the west,
And shuts the gates of day. 'Tis now the hour
When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,
#+end_verse

No woe, no gloom-and-doom, rather, a relentless parade of visceral and
natural Dark hyperconductivity. Barbauld hauls us outdoors to partake,
imbibe, behold. We are not obsessing on doom, rather, we are touched,
moved to reflect in reverence---

#+begin_verse
...But are they silent all? or is there not
A tongue in every star that talks with man,
And wooes him to be wife; nor wooes in vain:
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.
At this still hour the self-collected soul
Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there
Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;
An embryo God; a spark of fire divine,
Which must burn on for ages, when the sun,
(Fair transitory creature of a day!)
Has clos'd his golden eye, and wrap'd in shades
Forgets his wonted journey thro' the east.
#+end_verse

Night over day.[fn:71] Night a more expansive, passive, more nuanced
interim inviting deeper, more mature human introspection. Far distant,
cool and gentle are the myriad stars, unlike our single oversized and
often ruinous local star of day.

I mean to say this is my kind of Dark, i.e., free of any campy fright
devices. Most assuredly every protégé of the Dark Muse must read
Barbauld's lengthy masterpiece. Hers is an exposition of natural
darkness, placing it far above the reproach of gothic horror
detractors. Though /Meditation/ was no doubt a singleton, a unicorn
whose influence seemed to lay dormant for decades.[fn:72] One Barbauld
biographer mentioned a trend of that time of ladies studying
astronomy. But obviously Barbauld is waxing Dark, not repeating facts
about celestial bodies. Perusing her other poems, yes, she dwells on
nature, sometimes in a dusky way, but addressing Dark as she did with
/Meditation/ never again appeared so directly during her times. Today
she is known as an influential social commentator, moralist, and
educator, not as proto-Romantic. And so I must jump ahead some fifty
years and bring in Brontëan poetry as a continuation of this Night
School thread. Haworth Emily's /[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Poems_of_Emily_Bront%C3%AB/Stars][Stars]]/ is just one her many examples
of Night School from someone who probably had never read nor heard of
Barbauld's /Meditation/. Exactly like Barbauld, in /Stars/ Haworth
Emily lauds the night and its starry sky

#+begin_verse
Thought followed thought, star followed star
Through boundless regions, on;
While one sweet influence, near and far,
Thrilled through, and proved us one!

Why did the morning dawn to break
So great, so pure, a spell;
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,
Where your cool radiance fell?
#+end_verse

The night sky's depth and expanse over the trammels of life during
sunlight, indeed. And so the last two stanzas

#+begin_verse
Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night;
Oh, night and stars, return!
And hide me from the hostile light
That does not warm, but burn;

That drains the blood of suffering men;
Drinks tears, instead of dew;
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,
And only wake with you!
#+end_verse

Night School redeems Dark by pulling it out of the ostentatiousness,
the gimmickry of Graveyard and gothic. Started by Barbauld, it was
independently embraced by others. Let's look at sister Anne Brontë's
/Night/

#+begin_verse
I love the silent hour of night,
For blissful dreams may then arise,
Revealing to my charmed sight
What may not bless my waking eyes.

And then a voice may meet my ear,
That death has silenced long ago;
And hope and rapture may appear
Instead of solitude and woe.

Cold in the grave for years has lain
The form it was my bliss to see;
And only dreams can bring again,
The darling of my heart to me.
#+end_verse

Simpler, more measured was Anne's poetry than her sister's. And she
includes the grave by eulogising either of her older sisters Maria or
Elizabeth, or her mother, but again, sans drama.

This calmer, more introspective Dark dominated the eighteenth
century. And let us not forget the many poems devoted to the
moon. Here is Anne's /Fluctuations/

#+begin_verse
What though the Sun had left my sky;
To save me from despair
The blessed Moon arose on high,
And shone serenely there.

I watched her, with a tearful gaze,
Rise slowly o'er the hill,
While through the dim horizon's haze
Her light gleamed faint and chill.

I thought such wan and lifeless beams
Could ne'er my heart repay
For the bright sun's most transient gleams
That cheered me through the day:

But, as above that mist's control
She rose, and brighter shone,
I felt her light upon my soul;
But now—that light is gone!

Thick vapours snatched her from my sight,
And I was darkling left,
All in the cold and gloomy night,
Of light and hope bereft:

Until, methought, a little star
Shone forth with trembling ray,
To cheer me with its light afar—
But that, too, passed away.

Anon, an earthly meteor blazed
The gloomy darkness through;
I smiled, yet trembled while I gazed—
But that soon vanished too!

And darker, drearier fell the night
Upon my spirit then;—
But what is that faint struggling light?
Is it the Moon again?

Kind Heaven! increase that silvery gleam
And bid these clouds depart,
And let her soft celestial beam
Restore my fainting heart!
#+end_verse

Here we may imagine the youngest Brontë bowed if not weighed down by
her earthly afflictions, cares, deprivations, but then in this lean,
hungry, susceptible state caught in an emotional whirling, carried,
borne up by the natural nighttime procession of sun to moon and
stars. She speaks of her tearful gaze, her fainting heart, her
spirits, her emotional exposure. She is a vulnerable ward of nature,
but tenaciously pursuant of its subtleties. Indeed, back then it was
always subtleties, delicate qualities found in nature by the
vulnerable if not pathetic human, an exacting counting of seemingly
modest blessings which then gained sublime ascendency.

If I wasn't pledged to Emily, I might say Anne has an even finer take
on Dark than her older sister. I might dare to say Anne's Christianity
is more conventional, whereas Emily with her obvious
thought-behind-thoughts mental state took a starker, more fatalist view of
God. Anne humble, Emily defiant perhaps; *nevertheless, the Dark Muse
absolutely owned by these Brontës!*

Just for some balance, let me mention another Night Schooler, namely,
the Swiss poet [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Keller][Gottfried Keller]]. Again, he is even later by some
three or four decades than the Brontës. Here is his /Winternacht/ or
/Winter Night/

#+begin_verse
Not a wingbeat went through the world;
silent and brilliant lay the white snow.
Not a puff of cloud hung in the starry canopy,
no wave surged in the torpid lake.
 
From the depths climbed a lake-tree,
to its crown encased in ice;
and upon its branches climbed the water nymph,
gazing up through the green ice.
 
There I stood upon the thin glass
that separated me from the black depths;
Close beneath my feet I saw
her white beauty, limb for limb.
 
With smothered sorrow she groped
here and there on the hard barrier.
Never will I will forget her dark expression;
always, always, shall it remain in my mind!
#+end_verse

One of my favourites, I have always wondered what the man did with the
rest of his life. Did he return to the lake trying to find his water
nymph; or did he resign himself to his mortal and mundane life? In any
event, the mystery and allure of a forest in deep winter night is
undeniable. Such magic and mystery obviously could not have occurred
in daylight.

With Night School, first, nature is Dark, then human reflection upon
that natural Dark, i.e., no fake Dark, no camp, no hyperbole. Just the
deepest possible descriptions of the world in darkness bringing forth
some of humanity's finest insights.


** Romanticism

Another great hulking elephant in the middle of the room is
Romanticism. As I have not so subtly been hinting, what came to be
known as Romanticism is, to a large degree, the labeling work of the
herders, not the actual animals who never stopped to promote, package,
or label themselves. I'm about the animals, not their herdsmen. And
yet it is difficult to separate the two. Pull up an artist, musician,
poet of that era (late eighteenth and throughout the nineteenth
centuries?)---and along comes handlers, interpreters---management,
"suits." The self-awareness, the stewardship, in general, the
intentionality of Romanticism throughout the supposed Romantic period
is hard to ascertain. Was the Romantic Movement fully aware of itself
and acknowledged during its main fifty year duration (1800-1850)? Yes
and no: Yes the shepherds, the explainers talked it up (e.g., the Jena
Set, Coleridge, Emerson et al.), but as I believe, the actual
producers were mostly independent and self-absorbed unicorns not
following guidelines or living up to any expectations.[fn:73]
In any event, academe today has all the facts and figures, all the
categories and pigeonholes ready for our consumption. Caveat
emptor.[fn:74]

And yet how could we not have the non-talented running up ahead to
claim they are explaining, if not leading the cat herd? Two men who
wore both hats, i.e., creator and explainer, were Samuel Taylor
Coleridge and Edgar Allan Poe. And it is exactly with them that we see
their creations take us into the ephemeral mists of Romanticism's
subtleties and sublimities, while their intellectualizations and
pontifications thereof sounded windy, if not shrill. No wonder the
concept of left-brain, right-brain arose, as nothing else can describe
this split-personality confusion. But the urban salons demanded
rational, left-brain talk and copy. I, however, must separate out the
chatter and focus on the subtle and sublime.

*** English and German Romanticism

The first identifiable wave started just before and after the turn of
the nineteenth century. Coleridge and Wordsworth's collaboration
/Lyrical Ballads/ appeared in 1798, in the final years of the
eighteenth century, free of any of the intentionality implied by
academe. Today a artistic or cultural trend becomes global in less
than a day.  But in the closing years of the eighteenth and the
beginning of the nineteenth century there seemed to be something in
the air. AndAnd yet around every creative principal a group of
advocates, analysts, and explainers seemed to spring up---with many
"verisimilitudes caught from the Penetralium of mystery," as Keats
chided Coleridge. If beauty is best not intellectualised, then that
further station, sublimity and its Penetralia, was not to be jawed
about and chewed upon either. Fazit: Romanticism as it has come down
to us is a list of producers with far less in common with one another
than their contemporary and later describers would have[fn:75].

Academe wants what is called /Early German Romanticism/ to have begun
when Novalis' HTTN burst upon the scene in the very first year of the
nineteenth century. Clear to me, however, is that HTTN was a unicorn
one-off that came out of the blue, thus, certainly not intentional,
positioned for, or tailored to any specific agenda[fn:76]. But the
so-called /Jena Set/, an intellectual salon centred around the
Schlegel brothers, August Wilhelm and Friedrich, along with August's
wife and "den mother" Caroline, seized upon the mostly absentee
Novalis as their boy wonder /Liebling/ mascot---and the conflation of
producers and describers began in earnest. joined later by Friedrich
Schelling An intense as the inner circle of the Jena Set in Jena,
Germany, arose right before the beginning of the eighteenth century to
promote . And just a year after HTTN appreared Novalis dies on
them. Novalis and HTTN then left the radar as the Schlegel brothers,
August Wilhelm and Friedrich, along with August's wife and "den
mother" Caroline, joined later by Friedrich Schelling sally forth to
create an entire mountain range of much brighter descriptions of what
Jena Romanticism supposedly was[fn:77]. Which in turn is adopted by
Coleridge (sometimes as literal translation as in his [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographia_Literaria][Biographia
Literaria]] - 1817) and eventually by Emerson and the
Transcendentalists in the Colonies. Any brightening of the ominous
tremendous HTTN is irksome, but if we stay loyal to Dark, we may reach
further back to the English /[[https://www.britannica.com/art/graveyard-school][Graveyard School]]/ of the mid- and
late-eighteenth century.





*** Poe and Dark Romanticism

For
example /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Romanticism][Dark Romanticism]]/ was supposedly a phenomenon, and at its
centre was Edgar Allan Poe.[fn:78] Unfortunately The Wikipedia description of
Dark Romantic trots out all the negative stereotypes of Dark. But as
one biographer noted, Poe struggled all his short adult life to make a
living as a writer and poet. One supposed quote of his said “... your
writer of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big pen,
with a very blunt nib.” However the American publishing world was
rarely supportive, as one historian said, eager to move on from Dark
and gothic. And yet Poe always seemed to find audiences.




Up until his untimely death in 1849 at forty years
of age, Edgar Allen Poe was 

The Raven (1845) 

...was certainly not the death of Dark. Poe's Raven Keller's
/Winternacht/ (1846).
yes.


in an over-the-top way.

My principals had nothing to do with Schlegels or Coleridge or Emerson.

  There a gave way to the more
refined /Night School/, as well as /Graveside School/ blossoming in
the early nineteenth century.
A Midsummer's Meditation

Again, I suss out that both Poe and Emily Brontë

Fright v. melancholy.






After writing on my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ for the past seven years
I have made a rather bitter discovery, namely, that mankind is largely
wandering about clueless --- /seriously/ clueless.



** Really feeling

#+begin_verse
The best and most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched --- they must be felt with the heart.
--- Helen Keller
#+end_verse


** Grand Marais, my sepulchre by the sea?

One of my earliest brushes with Dostoevski's /presence of eternal
harmoy/ came to me on a Halloween night back when I was a little boy
in a small Southern Illinois town. We were trick-or-treating on our
street, the oldest neighborhood in town with Victorians, cobblestone,
and gas streetlights. At some point I felt like I had left the present
and entered another dimension, a nighttime fairy forest of bare
trees. Everything was magical, and yet as a child not yet disabused of
magic, I didn't think anything was too out of the ordinary. I
distinctly remember looking up into the dense, bare branches of a huge
old oak and seeing the moon looking in and out of crossing clouds and
feeling like I was a spirit entered another world. Tonight, I can see
this other world of shadow and magic as I look out at my
waning-moonlit /Inland Sea/ over the treetops of dark spruce and
gnarled, bare aspen.

I live in the far-northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called North
Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, along the shore
before the Canadian border. This so-called "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region][Arrowhead Region]]" holds
some three million-plus acres of wilderness on the shores of the
world's largest body (by surface area) of freshwater. And to my mind,
this is a very Dark Muse kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, I
cannot go. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but our Dark vibe
here must be experienced to be really appreciated.

Though I'm wont to call Lake Superior the /Inland Sea/, thus, North
Coast instead of North Shore. This is due to /her/ being so much more
sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is something much
smaller and much friendlier. The Inland Sea is big and often violent
like any sea or ocean of saltwater. She's no simple lake for
beer-and-brats picnickers, windsurfers, speedboat and jet ski
riffraff[fn:79]. /She/ has a mighty présence, often dark and moody if
not threatening.

A deep moodiness prevails. Here is nothing really spectacular in the
sense of the Great Outdoors overwhelming with one postcard vista after
another---as we think of the American West and Alaska. Rather, here is
a more subtlety, more reserve, more mood.

Though I feel quite alone here in this assessment. My little
village, Grand Marais, the county seat, is only some thirteen hundred
souls. And yet as the years go by we are becoming evermore
suburban-like in mentality. Being a popular Northern Midwest resort
town, We have a steady stream of newcomers who increasingly are not
adapting to small-town life; instead, maintaining their aloof,
disengaged, blinkered urban-suburban ways. So often one encounters
another supposed fellow human---only to receive the "you don't exist"
treatment common on a street in Manhattan.

Another social-psychology pitfall is how many people came up from a
Chicago or especially Twin Cities suburb ostensibly to reinvent
themselves. They've made the leap out of the sterile, soulless
clone-bunny suburbia to now be some new version of themselves. They
typically use Hemingway and Jack London, i.e., a macho attitude about
wilderness and what. I call this /Neo-Klondikism/.

Steger etc. totally different from the real pioneers of late 19th-,
early 20th-century who brought Victorian civilization to the
wilderness.

Grand Marais is my "sepulchre by the sea."

Quietude and contemplation in a place far from civilization.

** /My background/

** About the name Wuthering.UK

* Footnotes

[fn:1] /muse/: Originally any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts; /or/ a state of
deep thought or abstraction, e.g., to enter a /muse/ over a poem; /or/
a source of inspiration, e.g., /She is my muse/.

[fn:2] Indeed, /sublimity/. More on Edmund Burke's (as well as
Bertrand Russell's) false, "they don't get it at all" tedium on
/sublimity/ later. In short, /sublime/ is what we may find beyond mere
beauty, touching what Dostoevsky is saying here: /There are seconds,
they only come five or six at a time, and you suddenly feel the
*presence of eternal harmony* (POEH) fully achieved. It is nothing
earthly; not that it is heavenly, but man cannot endure it in his
earthly state. One must change physically or die. The feeling is clear
and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense the whole of nature and
suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not tenderheartedness, but
simply joy./ ... Perhaps awe instead of joy? Again, much more as we go
along...

[fn:3] Quick preliminary, much more later: The term Romanticism
followed a twisted path beginning with the Latin /romant/, or, "in the
Roman manner", thus, not at all our current use of the word as a
synonym of love.

[fn:4] Hmm... Does that mean Romanticism is an /irrational, illogical/
response?

[fn:5] ...described [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture][here]] as well as anywhere. \\
[[file:images/RyderBeetlejuice.jpg]]

[fn:6] Allow me German noun capitalisation for poetic emphasis.

[fn:7] As philosopher and psychologist John Vervaeke said in
describing the modern crisis of anxiety and dysphoria, "Horror is the
/aesthetic/ of when you feel like you're losing your grip on reality."
Nothing to gain with horror memes. Not going there...

[fn:8] ...while so much of our modern poetry is screed doggerel. For
example, Allen Ginsberg acclaimed /Howl/ is really social-political
pamphleteering in verse, not true poetry as it has been known for
centuries.

[fn:9] ...by one of my Victorian Era-heavy schoolmarms?

[fn:10] Oddly enough, I've never read her /Wuthering Heights/ and do
not intend to. However, her poetry I read continually, discovering new
things, gleaning deeper insights each time. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB][here]] for a quick
biography.  \\
[[file:images/Emily_Brontë_by_Patrick_Branwell_Brontë_restored.jpg]] \\

[fn:11] See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Rossetti][here]] for a bio. She is considered by many Britain's
most prolific poet. \\
[[file:images/RossettiAge16.jpg]] \\

[fn:12] Yes, poems. as the Dark Muse seems to find its best, most
concentrated expression through poetry. Much more on why mainly poetry
delivers the ineffable of darkness later.

[fn:13] Go [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow][here]] for a quick biography. HWL was not typically Dark,
rather, a popular "uplifting" poet with a big audience. That's what
makes this selection so unique for me.

[fn:14] The idea of poetising, the /poetisation/ of nature and life was
central to the Romantic Movement. It parallels the long-standing
belief that we humans explain ourselves through, embed our lives in
narratives, and in olden times nature was the stage.

[fn:15] Dark as a teacher. The German poet Novalis, whom we'll meet
later, described in exceptionally moving poetic terms the night as a
soother and healer.

[fn:16] /modus vivendi/: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, /or/ (literally) a way of living.

[fn:17] Queen Victoria in mourning black ca. 1862. \\
[[file:images/QueenVictoriaInMourningBlack.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:18] Is there anything worse than the so-called /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief][five stages of
grief]]/ or the Kübler-Ross model? Grief as an emotional malfunction
to be systematically reduced, fixed, corrected? Alas.

[fn:19] Lots more about my novel as we go.

[fn:20] See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson][here]] for a quick biography. \\
[[file:images/EmilyDickinson.png]]
\\
\\

[fn:21] In the third line, /Heft/ means weight, heaviness; importance,
influence; /or/ (archaic) the greater part or bulk of something.

[fn:22] Again, Dickinson often employed the capitalising of nouns for
poetic emphasis.

[fn:23] My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson is based on
their towns of origin --- Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.

[fn:24] Deep indoors deep in the forest... \\
[[file:images/MaxIndoorsOutdoorsGradient.png]] \\
\\

[fn:25] Is it not ironic how nearly every lifeform that attempts to
share our human environments uninvited are considered invasive,
noxious vermin, pests to which we have developed almost hysterical
revulsion?

[fn:26] However cotton was rapidly becoming a global commodity, both
cotton and wool fabrics eventually being produced in steam-powered
factories as the Industrial Age reached its inflexion point of growth.

[fn:27] In any modern (non-organic Amazon Whole Foods-style)
supermarket I'm sure less that 1% of the food items come from a truly
local source. Nearly everything is shipped in from often far afar.

[fn:28] ...e.g., what is a flower garden but a derivative, a mock-up
of an original place out in the wilds, albeit with the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits left, weeded out?

[fn:29] How often is a Shakespeare character out communing with
nature? Never?...

[fn:30] Churches were typically built in the centre of a town or city
on the highest ground. I once heard that to this day no building in
Vienna may be built taller than the tower of St. Stephen's Cathedral.

[fn:31] ...with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as a leading
style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
"revivalist-nostalgic" (Greek, Gothic, Italianate, Elizabethan, Queen
Anne, etc.), perhaps a hearkening back to times more integrated with
nature, with shallower gradients between indoors and outdoors?

[fn:32] Adaptability leading to, A) a permanent (beneficial)
alteration, or B) a temporary adjustment, allowance for
less-that-optimal conditions, supposing an eventual return to optimal
conditions. We humans, I contend, are B-adaptable. This means we are
certainly no barometer species or "canary in the coal mine" of our own
well-being. We routinely ignore our fellow canary-like humans,
allowing them to suffer and die, their warnings unheeded.

[fn:33] Human population grew 60% between 1800 and 1900, and /260%/
between 1900 and 2000.

[fn:34] Modern human narratives come at us as thousands upon thousands
of fictional novels, films, plays, while aboriginal peoples had myth
and legends timeless and unchanging. That alone...

[fn:35] Is our relatively gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog][boiling frog]] metaphor?

[fn:36] Consider how the Industrial Revolution created urban
production landscapes vast and barren and completely outside of any
sort of nature, spatial or otherwise---indeed, William Blake's
"satanic mills."  This was a change on a scale never before seen, a
huge and relatively sudden step away from the physical world being
solely the purveyance of nature. Even when the individual left his
house he was still deep within a massive concentration of
extra-natural, human-exclusive space and activity.

[fn:37] In those days wild, untouched places were often referred to as
wastelands.

[fn:38] What is generally acknowledged as a clear breakthrough was
John Snow's tracing of the London cholera outbreak of 1854 back to
certain London neighborhood publich wells. This was strong proof of
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease][contagion theory]]. However, it wasn't until the late nineteenth
century that Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur established the field of
bacteriology and our modern scientific understanding of microscopic
pathogens developed.

[fn:39] Couple this mechanistic "death as malfunction" with atheist
nihilism to arrive at a completely soulless mechanical universe
realism dumpster fire.

[fn:40] For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are---outside of war and homicidal aggression---all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.

[fn:41] Consider [[https://youtu.be/SMNGhPgCKzw?si=L4HFHQuUTnP3j8I6][this goth version]] of the classic rock song. Had this
been written in Brontëan times, it would have been no cheap,
sentimental gimmick.

[fn:42] Consider the commonplace heart pacemaker, a device that
literally commands the human heart with artificial electronic pulses.

[fn:43] Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.

[fn:44] Anne Brontë's grave in Scarborough \\

\\
\\
Perhaps watch [[https://youtu.be/_yzBEP3Qyvc?si=QBkrGikYxWP7C9eN][this]] on Anne's last days in Scarborough.

[fn:45] In my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/, which I will eventually
discuss, I have a character saying yes, she would get in a time
machine and go back the Brontëan times. But what if you faced a
fifty-fifty chance of dying from a now curable, fixable condition? her
friend asks. Yes, she replies, I would /trust/ my life, and /trust/ my
death.

[fn:46] ...quoted from the third volume, /Fragmente/, of /Novalis:
Werke, Briefe, Dokumente/; Verlag Lambert Schneider; 1957.

[fn:47] Allow me the abbreviation /HTTN/ from here on.

account shortly.

[fn:49] See the Wikipedia explanation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism][Romanticism]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Romanticism][German
Romanticism]]. They're as stiff and ultimately as clueless as any...

[fn:50] Soon will be discussed things Dark from the previous
eighteenth century.

[fn:51] Try [[https://www.george-macdonald.com/etexts/hymns_to_night.html][this George MacDonald translation]] as found in a
publication from 1897. Amazing how obscure unknown the keynote address
to the whole Romanticism convention has been. I'll try at a better,
annotated version soon.

[fn:52] *penetralium*: (plural /penetralia/) the innermost (or most
secret) part of a building; an inner sanctum; a sanctum sanctorum.

[fn:53] *verisimilar*: having the appearance of truth.

[fn:54] /The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature's Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work/ by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.

[fn:55] Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven't noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats' primary food sources.

[fn:56] Compare with today's outdoor adventurer with technical gear
from REI, Patagonia, North Face, driving to government set-aside wilds
in a four-wheel-drive Jeep Cherokee, consuming protein bars and
electrolyte drinks, listening to music with earbuds, taking smart
phone pictures and GoPro videos. Any mishaps? Call for immediate
helicopter rescue on a satellite connection... At some point we're
just amateur Earth astronauts, no? When nature is in balance, all
participants are underdogs to some degree.

[fn:57] A stay in Belgium to learn French and a short-lived gig in
nearby Halifax as a governess.

[fn:58] We consume one hundred times the resources and energy per
capita as one of our European ancestors from 1800.

[fn:59] We'll look into /doom/ more thoroughly in the future. Suffice
it now to say doom is that condition whereby sins, however initially
minor and insignificant, have lead to a snowballing of consequences
unforeseen, typically multi-generational, always negative.

[fn:60] More on what I mean by "my corner" very soon...

[fn:61] From my 1853 copy \\
[[file:images/NightThoughtsBook2.jpg]]

[fn:62] A woebegone maiden deep in the slings and arrows of her no
doubt cursed, doomed existence (from /El Mundo ilustrado/; 1879). \\

[fn:63] ...that is, in an past age not exposed to the science of
modern public relations. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays][this]] about Edward Bernays and the birth
of modern advertising and public relations. TL;DR: Since Bernays, no
"movement" can be considered natural and organic.

[fn:64] For example, Germany has long been referred to as the land of
/poets/ and /thinkers/ (/Das Land der Dichter und
Denker/). Intentionally absent is novelists. Although now novelists
count as part of /die Belletristik/, i.e., /schöngeistige Literatur/
or aesthetic literature.

[fn:65] Two terms, /novel/ (English) and /roman/ (French, German,
etc. from the adjectival /Roman/, /Roman-like/) came to describe any
long-form prose story-telling.

[fn:66] Ironically, the /Novella/, a long short-story format with no
chapter breaks, was seemingly better tolerated in Germany.

[fn:67] One giveaway is /gothic/ in the title. Perhaps read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction][this
overview]] of Gothic fiction.

[fn:68] Walpole initially claimed /Otranto/ to be a medieval
manuscript he had discovered and translated when it was completely his
own creation all along.

[fn:69] ...although this is ironic since the actual label Gothic had
been used pejoratively in the Renaissance alluding to the
destructive barbarian Goths.

[fn:70] The popularity of the gothic novel continued throughout the
nineteenth and into the twentieth century primarily in the Romance
genre. Among others, Frances Parkinson Keyes was a popular romance
author who often wrote from a gothic perspective. /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonwyck_(film)][Dragonwyck]]/ (1946)
is a prime example of Hollywood does gothic romance. Once asked why
his horror films were so popular, Alfred Hitchcock said the man on the
street likes to dip his toe in the lake of horror occasionally.

[fn:71] And here's some of my own doggerel, /From a Grandniece To Her
Great-aunt At Her Great-uncle’s Funeral/: \\
  You see, dear Auntie, \\
  Day is all supposes, \\
  Night but only a few. \\
  Night quietly closes \\
  Day’s great to-do. \\
  Lost on the Day, \\
  I wait for deepest Night, \\
  for Darkness and I must \\
  Decline clamant Light. \\
\\

[fn:72] ...although Wordsworth would later mention Barbauld and
/Meditation/ as inspirational.

[fn:73] ...e.g., the Brontës were pastor's daughters in rural West
Yorkshire with little exposure to (taint from?) the cultural and
literary buzz of the cities.

[fn:74] One left-brain pedantic hot mess is the [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0144q90/episodes/guide][BBC's series on
Romanticism]]. (Catch it on YouTube under /The Romantics: [[https://youtu.be/oLwRXlSgiSQ?si=y4a1MQek8Ac0pkyJ][Liberty]],
[[https://youtu.be/liVQ21KZfOI?si=GpsPOUfS_l6w6r8_][Nature]], [[https://youtu.be/R6mefXs5h9o?si=c-cJk0fKTneunPZH][Eternity]])/. And then Bertrand Russell in his /The History of
Western Philosophy/ mangles away at it in his consummate left-brain
way.

[fn:75] Again, my principle principal, Emily Brontë, arguably knew
very little to absolutely nothing about Jena, Novalis, or even much of
Coleridge and Wordsworth other than perhaps a reading of their
/Lyrical Ballads/ (from 1798). Poe supposedly had encountered
translations of Ludwig Tieck's short stories. That is to say, the
principals were rarely that well studied of their like-minds.

[fn:76] Contrast this with Goethe's play /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Tauris_(Goethe)][Iphigenia in Tauris]]/, a
version of the Euripedes' original which was specifically meant to be
a showcase example of Goethe's ideal of modern classicism, i.e., his
and Friedrich Schiller's [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Classicism][Weimar Classicism]].

[fn:77] Must again mention Christina Wulf's non-fiction tome
/Magnificent Rebels/ as Exhibit A of how the describers and explainers
just did not get it. Wulf's detailed description of the "Jena Set"
sounds similar to accounts of Andy Warhol's /Factory/ and its bipolar
crowd.

[fn:79] Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her lasting more
than ten minutes can lead to hypothermia ... at least on the North
Coast. Wisconsin and Michigan beaches can be swimmable in the height
of summer.
