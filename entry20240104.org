** /Introduction/

The purpose of this media effort will be to convey some of my thoughts
and impressions about all things dark, or what I call the /Dark
Muse/. Here is an example, a test of sorts from Emily Brontë [fn:1]

#+begin_verse
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse

Unfortunately, many associate dark with depression, morbidity, if not
evil. This is certainly not my take on dark, rather, dark from a
purely aesthetic perspective. Here is another great example of "you
either get dark or you don't," this time from Emily Dickinson's [fn:2]
/There's a certain slant of light/

#+begin_verse
There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons –
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes –

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us –
We can find no scar,
But internal difference –
Where the Meanings, are –

None may teach it – Any –
'Tis the seal Despair –
An imperial affliction
Sent us of the Air –

When it comes, the Landscape listens –
Shadows – hold their breath –
When it goes, 'tis like the Distance
On the look of Death –
#+end_verse

The last line includes /Death/, capitalised. Why? I say they had a
completely different understanding and approach to death than we do
today. And since this capitalised, other-century Death has become so
opaque, thus, the main sticking point in today's understanding of
goth, gothic, the Dark Muse, let us talk a bit about their version of
Death.

** Nature and Death in the 19th century

➝ The increasingly extra-natural human

It is my contention that we understand nature differently than such
early-nineteenth-century poets as the Haworth and Amherst
Emilies [fn:3] and their contemporaries might have. If we just
consider dwelling spaces, our modern indoor environments are hardly
less sealed off than spaceships on a hostile alien planet compared to
indoor environments of the not-so-distant past. Literally, the
Brontës' Haworth parsonage had more in common structurally with human
shelters from thousands of years previous than with our buildings only
two hundred years later. /In just these two hundred years a very steep
gradient has grown between indoors and outdoors./ And this, in turn,
has brought us to see nature more as a place outside of our sealed-off
high-tech modern spaces. Which, in turn, leads us to rate the outdoor
world on continua of wildness and distance from our greatly unnatural
collections of sealed-off indoors.

Of course humans have made the distinction of indoors and outdoors
long before civilization began some six thousand years ago. And of
course dwellings were concentrated into hamlets, towns, and eventually
into permanent city-states. But yes, the height, the steepness, the
suddenness of the indoor-outdoor gradient has increased dramatically
since Western Victorian times, leading to the penultimate
/extra-natural/ state in which humanity now find itself. Down through
the centuries more and more of humanity has come into the /Great
Indoors/, and indoors has been evermore removed from anything of the
natural world. And especially in the West, architecture reached an
aesthetic crescendo in the nineteenth century just as cities became
exponentially larger and increasingly "indoorsy" than just a century
before.

So what could nature be if not that uncontrolled, unmanaged,
uncultivated, unregulated, unkempt, unchecked, unruly landscape
outside? What if nature were not a place, rather, everything,
literally? That is, what if we define nature as the myriad of cycles
of birth, growth, deterioration, and death going on all around and
everywhere, entirely without any concept of in- or outdoors?  To be
sure, the Brontës would have know this more aboriginal meaning of
nature as countless processes in concert than a place outside of
inside.

With this understanding of a more universal nature, i.e., cycles of
birth, growth, deterioration, and death, the last component,
deterioration and death go beyond mechanistic malfunction, i.e., a
negative outcome after modern health
care's labyrinth of diagnoses and repair attempts. Instead, death
becomes Death.   For other creatures death is either old age, or



Today nature is something entirely outdoors, e.g., the /Great
Outdoors/. 


After writing on my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ for the past seven years
I have made a rather bitter discovery, namely, that mankind is largely
wandering about clueless --- /seriously/ clueless.

One key turning point was to finally understand what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats][John Keats]] meant
in his /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability][Negative Capability]]/ letter to his brother. In it he describes
what he means by Negative Capability, the ability to not rush to
philosophical conclusion, rather, to let a sort of cognitive
dissonance run its course. But then Keats also condemns Samuel
Coleridge's obsession with philosophical truth, repudiating his
/Biographia Litararia/, which was Coleridge's attempt to, among other
things, bring the bulk of German Romanticism to a British audience.
