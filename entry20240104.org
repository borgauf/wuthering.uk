** To begin

(/Note: I began writing this in the Winter of 2024 and it is now High
Summer; hence, my external references might shift as we go.../)

Light snow drifts gently down from the low clouds draped over a misty
boreal forest. Deer in their grey winter coats process through the fir
and spruce. Ravens and crows dolefully croak and caw back and
forth. And I burn a daytime candle. Such an ambience to convey my
thoughts, my impressions and /feelings/ about my /Dark Muse/.[fn:1]

Do you have an inexplicable fascination with things on the gloomy
side? You often find /dreamy/ what others find /dreary/ ... as when an
overcast day brings on a strangely sanguine melancholy ... or a stormy
night is magnificent in a frightening and thrilling sort of
way. Twilight is a welcome reprieve from the hectic, incessant day,
freeing your senses, calming, deepening your thoughts. You've paused
to gaze transfixed upon a lonely, nondescript landscape, a wild,
deserted shore, an old, abandoned cemetery. Just like a decaying,
overgrown, other-century structure makes you envious of the bats
living there. Unnatural is having to get out of heat into air
conditioning and suffer through smalltalk while drinking iced
beverages; truer it seems to come inside out of the cold and sit by a
fire in a deep, shared silence drinking hot tea. Time and again what
they find uplifting is piteously trite out to ruefully disappointing
for you. Panic and nausea well up when attempts are made at
sunny-cheery; then being alone is a relief, not always lonely. What is
spectacular to them is suspect and eventually disappointing to you
... whereas things subtle, veiled, shadowy tenuous, understated are
intriguing. Stirrings, please, but not shaking or slamming. Their
heroes grasp desperately at happy endings. Yours learn and grow from
facing grim and harsh---and if it means succumbing to the thrashing,
amen, RIP,[fn:2] c'est la vie, time for mourning black. Candlelight
over artificial light, wool over nylon, old architecture over new, the
genial disorder of wild nature over the forced containment of
gardens. If in a city, you can't stand anywhere but the oldest
quarters and big, old parks.  And yes, it might seem a bit to ask, but
wouldn't it be grand if every month we celebrated Halloween?...  If yes
to any of this, you might understand what I'm trying to say here.

*** Bronëan natural Dark

I provide here a quote from Charlotte Brontë's /Jane Eyre An
Autobiography/. Main protagonist Jane describes the house, called
simply Moor House, and environs of her adoptive family, the Rivers, on
the edge of the wild, presumably Yorkshire moors,[fn:3]

#+begin_quote
They loved their sequestered home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique
structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering
walls, its avenue of aged firs---all grown aslant under the stress of
mountain winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly---and where no
flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom---found a charm both
potent and permanent. They clung to the purple moors behind and around
their dwelling---to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path
leading from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks
first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields
that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a
flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced
lambs---they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of
attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
and sweep---on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by
moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,
and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were
to them---so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast
and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of
sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for
me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them---wound round my
faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.
#+end_quote

... /the consecration of its loneliness/ indeed.[fn:4] I often read
this passage just to muse upon the wistful, moody, delicately
melancholic intentionally anti-spectacular subtleties she
describes---and how this and other choice moments set the whole tone
and mood of the book. Charlotte Brontë establishes light and dark as
equals, and then works expertly with the gradient there between. The
dim, the shadows, the dark, the harsh, even at times merciless
inclemencies are features not bugs. She does not suppress dark,
perhaps knowing that if it were seen an equal to light it would
eventually prove itself the older, wiser sibling capable of rich,
complimentary contributions. A notable gradient boon is how she has
the Moor House environs so very abandoned, lonely, thus ultra-wild
exactly because they are so unpresuming and overlooked, so bereft of
anything nature-spectacular ... as opposed to some breathtaking
primordial wilderness millions of miles away visited only by intrepid
explorers. Indeed, subtle and unassuming become the older, wiser
siblings of grand and spectacular. Notable too how Jane arrived at
Moor House---half dead on her hands and knees, thus, adding complete
vulnerability to this sublime mix. And once recovered, she is still
every bit the underdog---relative to us today in our
nature-domineering modern developed world. This point is key to what
I'll say later...

*** Nature staged...

Case in point: Consider the Great Smoky Mountains National Park high
on the Appalachian Mountains border of Tennessee and North
Carolina. The /Smokies/ are a federally protected, quasi-pristine
wilderness of 522,419 acres, surrounded by lesser-protected though
still completely wilderness state and USDA National Forest lands
coming to another million or so acres. Statistics say the national
park itself is visited by over fourteen million tourists per year,
with additional tourist attractions and accommodations all around the
park boundaries. And what are these visitors doing? Only a small
fraction are actually out on the park's extensive wilderness trails
hiking and camping. Most are either driving the main dissecting
highway connecting Tennessee to North Carolina or simply crowding into
the visitor centres per automobile. I once visited on the Fourth of
July, stopping in the main tourist town Gatlinburg, Tennessee, where
the sidewalks standing-room-only. But later that same day I hiked for
hours deep in the park on the main Appalachian Trail and saw not
another human. Indeed. Strange as this may seem, I say Jane's
Yorkshire moorlands are real nature, while the Smokies cannot be
simply because of the sheer abstraction, the artificiality of their
purpose, not to mention their publicity throughout the entire
world. The Smokies are fussed and ruled over by armies of scientists
and bureaucrats at the behest of the U.S. Department of Interior
National Park, UNESCO World Heritage Site, International Biosphere
Reserve, etc., like a great research terrarium under an invisible
glass dome. Even in the remotest, genuinely wild spots, the weight of
humanity's lurking dominance, our collective mental presence is
inescapably massive... And so we have the dichotomy of discovered and
undiscovered, exotic versus vernacular, integrated versus detached,
grounded versus transient, many versus no matches to googling. As the
Rivers' guest, Jane describes a natural and organic connection to her
moorland, while no modern tourist can ever expect to be truly
integrated with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park complex.[fn:5]
Lots more on what nature really means to us later...

*** My Dark /penchant/

Continuing, I am at a loss to explain my dark /penchant/ to those who
do not, cannot, will not get it. Dark as I mean it is strictly a
take-it-or-leave-it proposition; one gets Dark[fn:6] or one does
not. Dark as I mean it was best presented by certain principle *poets*
of the early nineteenth-century /Romantic/ Era,[fn:7] an /emergent/
property, a very special private corner of this ultimately maligned
and misunderstood time. To be sure, best expressed is the Dark Muse in
poetry, while prose not so well. I, as well as many others of yore,
believe that lyrical poetry captures far more and drives far deeper
than whatever can be lined up in long chains of prose sentences. For
example, it is almost as if principal poetess Emily Dickinson used
words to mercilessly expose just how tenuous words really are. She
routinely made words give up their ghosts just to swap in even more
mysterious ghosts---again, something best done with poetry. We'll
explore some of her wicked flights into /thoughts behind thoughts/ as
we go. When you read my Amherst Emily haiku-like lines, think of Zen
koans for the Dark Muse.

I can only say my Dark Muse often comes on as a /feeling behind
feeling/, subtle, profound, yet fleeting, not hanging around for
pedantics' tedious descriptions.[fn:8] Dark stirrings arrive mostly
unannounced, a veritable surprise. *Dark is a gift* for which one says
thank you and doesn't immediately Google Lens to see how much it
cost. Thus, my exploration of Dark will rely heavily on the poetry of
the preeminent Romantic Era champions of Dark Muse.

** Adding an extra wagon to the goth train

Of course I have an affinity with and feel a kinship to the modern
goth subculture.[fn:9] And yet it is one of the elephants I must shift
a few inches from the centre of the room. In very short, I believe
modern goths surely /sense/ Dark,[fn:10] but for whatever reasons so
many of them only want to express it, explore it very narrowly through
goth music and fashion. My Dark Muse would hopefully include, be akin
to what is today called goth and gothic, /but I must go deeper and
more elemental/. If you are goth I hope you allow me to speak to your
"inner goth."

I'll start by saying there is a /natural darkness/ that Nature
provides, a basis upon which we may create symbols, artefacts, icons,
trappings to emulate, decorate, magnify, socialise, humanise, if
nothing else, /bring indoors/ natural Dark. Yes to aesthetics as far
as they may resonate, do honour to Dark. But too often our human take
on Dark winds up overstated, overwrought---all the way out to grimy,
ignoble, silly, scummy. We imbibe then express what we see,
experience, feel. But I say it must be done carefully, if not
respectfully. And so I must reject so many of the overdone /gothic/
horror fright memes, e.g., vampires, witches, demons; mean nasty
menacing this, threatening evil that. Right up front: My Dark is
not meant to shock or frighten, rather, invite, deepen, and enrich. My
Dark Muse contains nothing cruel nor evil nor sinister nor satanic. As
philosopher and psychologist John Vervaeke said in describing the
modern crisis of anxiety and dysphoria, "Horror is the /aesthetic/ of
when you feel like you're losing your grip on reality." Thus, I might
dip my toe in the lake of horror, as Alfred Hitchcock once said, but I
needn't dwell there too long. Mine is not the /Star Wars/ "dark side,"
not dark barbarism à la /Heart of Darkness/, and not the psychic dark
described by Freud or Jung. I cringe when someone says, "...and then
things took a /dark/ turn." In general

\begin{align*}
\large{\text{Dark} \ne \text{negative}}
\end{align*}

Again, campy, over-the-top gothic can be interesting, fun, but I'd
rather not lose sight of the source, however obscure and rare it may
be.[fn:11] I'm after something more subtle, discriminating,
inward-personal ... perhaps like the small natural sweet of a wild
strawberry versus the chemical sweet blast of saccharine ... natural
rather than manufactured. Great big point: *My Dark is about the
sublime*, indeed, /sublimity/. I will eventually deal with Edmund
Burke's (as well as Bertrand Russell's) false, "they don't get it at
all" tedium on /sublimity/ later. In the meantime, /sublime/ is
basically what we may find beyond mere beauty, touching what
Dostoevsky is saying here

#+begin_quote
There are seconds, they only come five or six at a time, and you
suddenly feel the *presence of eternal harmony* (POEH) fully
achieved. It is nothing earthly; not that it is heavenly, but man
cannot endure it in his earthly state. One must change physically or
die. The feeling is clear and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense
the whole of nature and suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not
tenderheartedness, but simply joy.
#+end_quote

Awe instead of joy? Again, much more fleshing out as we go along...

And so I hearken back to a golden era when Dark was the cultural
currency, to be sure, the early nineteenth century, a time when my key
poets, my /principals/ (e.g. Poe, Novalis, the Brontës) showed us how
triste and Stygian can be so very subtle and sublime. I'm after
something /I will not outgrow/, rather, continue as my raison d'être
sustaining me to my grave. And so I say there must be no "aging out of
the scene" as I fear often happens with modern goth.[fn:12] Rather, the Dark
Muse should be a deepening and widening and transcendence for one's
entire life.

** Anti-English retrenchment

Another ox gored is my rejection of modern dumbed-down American street
English, which has permeated modern society virtually
worldwide. Basically, I mean to sound more erudite, sophisticated,
intellectual with my use of past-century British-tinted English. Why?
Simply because the English of the early-nineteenth century was like a
thoroughbred race horse, sleek and powerful, capable of amazingly deep
and magical expression. Contrast this with beggared, destitute,
impoverished, needlessly retrenched modern American street English,
which requires a buy-in to a particularly base, ignorant, crude and
aggressive hipster Zeitgeist. Which I repudiate, not going
there. Although I'm sure I'll occasionally slip up.[fn:13]

Back in the day, people were more genteel, thoughtful,
fine-spoken. Indeed, back when having character and honour, when
showing decorum and graciousness was a way of life. As a result, their
poetry could express the depths and heights of human thought and
sensitivities so much better.[fn:14] In past centuries they understood
the human need for holiness, grandeur, the epic and eternal. I say all
of this is necessary to fully grasp their exquisite take on the Dark
Muse. Compare this with the crypto-rebel posers we see everywhere
today who believe being coarse, crass, base, irreverent---and
arrogantly in-your-face about it---is somehow progressive and
desirable...

But on the other hand, it might just be that I've finally succumbed to
the influence of all those schoolmarms back in my distant 1950s-60s
childhood who made us read, e.g., Shakespeare and Hawthorn, all those
nearing-retirement throw-backs who held up "wordy," other-century
English as superior. Mrs Mugwortlawny was right, you know. And yes,
I'll occasionally drop foreign as well as Latin words and phrases, my
foreign language being German. You have been warned...

** Dark like me?

For me life seems empty, insipid, weak, every moment rudderless,
misspent, crushingly mundane without a strong and constant current of
the Dark Muse. It is as if life cannot be properly understood without
the dark perspective. And then I wonder, *is this nature or nurture*?
That is to say, are we innately so, or is this something
acculturated?[fn:15] I /feel/ it is the former. One simply /feels/
the tug of Dark---regardless of any sort of prepping or grooming. But
let's do another quick litmus test. I present here a short, simple
poem from my main darkness benefactress, the poetess who stands at the
centre of everything I mean to say about dark, namely, Emily Jane
Brontë[fn:16]

#+begin_verse
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse

Here EB is direct, blunt even. But now we know. Either she speaks to
something in you, or you are part of the majority who finds
it---weird, abnormal, morbid, overwrought, puerile, even sick or
evil. To be sure, my dark /penchant/ gets mostly deer-in-headlights
responses, if not outright hostility. The openly hostile see my dark
druthers as morose, morbid, as wallowing in self-pity, seeking
attention, dwelling on the negative---and then the quick DSM–5
look-up.[fn:17] I beg to differ...

Here is something a bit lighter but the same basic idea from
/Christina Rossetti/ [fn:18]

#+begin_verse
Fade tender lily,
Fade O crimson rose,
Fade every flower
Sweetest flower that blows.

Go chilly Autumn,
Come O Winter cold;
Let the green things die away
Into common mould.

Birth follows hard on death,
Life on withering:
Hasten, we shall come the sooner
Back to pleasant Spring.
#+end_verse

Rossetti exposits a dark fatalism, ending with hope bound in humble
expectancy. I like to think these two English poetesses are expressing
an informed, matured melancholy that bespeaks a deeper understanding
of life---all because of their grasp of Dark.

And another poem,[fn:19] here Longfellow's /Snow-flakes/ from a
collection published in 1863

#+begin_verse
Out of the bosom of the Air,
      Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,
Over the woodlands brown and bare,
      Over the harvest-fields forsaken,
            Silent, and soft, and slow
            Descends the snow.

Even as our cloudy fancies take
      Suddenly shape in some divine expression,
Even as the troubled heart doth make
      In the white countenance confession,
            The troubled sky reveals
            The grief it feels.

This is the poem of the air,
      Slowly in silent syllables recorded;
This is the secret of despair,
      Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,
            Now whispered and revealed
            To wood and field.
#+end_verse

Here I see Longfellow[fn:20] looking to the natural world and
/poetising/, to be sure, /darkly/. The idea of poetising, the
/poetisation/ of nature and life was central to the Romantic
Movement.[fn:21] It parallels the long-standing belief that we humans
explain ourselves through, embed our lives in narratives. And so
agents, triggers of mental affliction and depression---despair, grief,
misery---are transformed into more equanimous states of sadness and
melancholy, hopefully bringing us to a higher emotional
maturity.[fn:22] In some paradoxical way, nature and darkness
eventually become healers ... as if the initial agony and sorrow are a
ravaging cancer or virus that may eventually fade into remission, but
we can never entirely conquer, eliminate whilst on Earth. As I will
endeavour to explain, being /mortal/ was wholly different back then.

This /poetising/ of Nature dark and mystical was the modus operandi of
my select nineteenth-century poets. Rather than avoid, they sought
out, /embraced/ their Dark Muse, something we today in our
brightly-lit, cordoned-off world usually think of as wrong-headed. I
contend we have lost this subtle art of moving hardship, tragedy,
emotional crises into a stasis remission melancholy. Today, we wage a
full-scale war against melancholia psycho-analyses and prescription
psycho-pharma drugs. And so too often we are failures at finding a
/modus vivendi/[fn:23] vis-à-vis the trials and tribulations of life
as our ancestors once did.

*** Suffering

Surely the human suffers poorly. Again, all we may ever do is disperse
the initially searing, inescapable pain to a dull, hopefully diluted
ache in the ever-growing backdrop of time. Though again I would say
this was better conducted in the past than today. How, why? Because
they did not attempt to contain, disguise, systematise, or /process/
greif; rather, greif was faced directly, /pain was shared/, empathy a
way of communal life. And so emotional space was allotted, support was
shared, organic, and natural. Strikingly different from today was
their acceptance of /doom/[fn:24] and fate, two concepts antithetical
to our dynamic, positivist, self-determining,
fix/paper-over-everything-quickly modern ways.

Consider Queen Victoria[fn:25] who wore mourning black from the time
of her husband Prince Albert's death in 1861 till the end of her life
in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg who upon losing her husband
Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. In those days death was properly, officially mourned. No one
chivvied mourners along with their grief and sadness. Contrast this
with today's all-too-prevalent disassociation, the confused emotional
shutdown, the disorganised quasi-denial and suppression we moderns too
often show towards death[fn:26]. For the early nineteenth century,
poetising life's train of tragedy was /depression deconstruction/ as a
life skill. The slings and arrows of human existence found conjunction
with /Nature/, /Dark/, and /Faith/ through poetry, thereby
highlighting, elevating our uniquely human experience on Earth,
*casting a gossamer of sublimity over our natural existence like no
other generation before or since*. Theirs was the deepest exploration
of our true humanness that I know, and, thus, something I must pursue
and showcase here.

** But why Dark?

But still, why Dark? Dark speaks to me. But again, how, why? Lack of a
clear and simple answer forces me into a regrettably wordier one?
Dark remains mysterious---no matter how many different angles from
which I try to imbibe and then express it. Dark is something
instinctual, cathartic, evocative, centring for me. Dark is more than
the lack of light. Dark can lead the imagination to riot. The moss,
lichens, and mushrooms in the secretive shadows of the forest incite
so much more than the spectacular sunny vista across the forest
valley. Let's give spectacular a rest.

The fresh-cut rose elicits a simple response, but the faded rose
another---deeper, but for me never "depressing". Here is something
from my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ [fn:27]

#+begin_quote
The new cut rose: Initially beautiful, thereafter dried and
desiccated, lost forever its initial delicate beauty and
fragrance. Once affording a glimpse of perfection, only reminiscent
thereafter. Beauty always some fleeting illusion or madness? Moreover
its eclipse, joining, leading the shadows of our relentless doom, our
march to the grave. And though I live in this momentary brilliance, I
still search my night shore; for until now I have known only of
beauty’s haunting rumour, of love’s promise, those slightest
quickenings of things necessarily rare and formerly peripheral. Yes,
in this moment I may have some of love’s bliss, of roses' beauty, but
I know I shall cherish with a larger, more mature heart the memories
thereof, echoes sent down life’s long, clouded memory hall as true and
lasting blessings.
#+end_quote

Yes, there might have been a dinner invite for me back in the day... 

Let's see another example of get-it-or-don't, this time a poem from
Emily Elizabeth Dickinson[fn:28] of mid-1800s Amherst, Massachusetts,
her /There's a certain slant of light/[fn:29]

#+begin_verse
There's a certain Slant of light,
Winter Afternoons — 
That oppresses, like the Heft
Of Cathedral Tunes --- 

Heavenly Hurt, it gives us --- 
We can find no scar, 
But internal difference --- 
Where the Meanings, are --- 

None may teach it – Any --- 
'Tis the seal Despair --- 
An imperial affliction 
Sent us of the Air --- 

When it comes, the Landscape listens --- 
Shadows – hold their breath --- 
When it goes, 'tis like the Distance 
On the look of Death --- 
#+end_verse

Let that sink in for a while... The last line includes /Death/
capitalised.[fn:30] Again, I must emphasise these nineteenth-century
artists approached human mortality much differently than we do
today. Unfortunately, this past-century view of Death has become
opaque, lost. I hope to rediscover it. I'll start by positing their
understanding of Death was integral to their understanding of
Nature...

** Nature and Death in the nineteenth century

/The main points being:/
+ True nature is /birth, growth, deterioration, and death/, full
  stop, nothing else...
+ ...ergo, /nature is not a place/, inside or out, rather, a state of
  being, existence itself...
+ ...ergo, no degrees of nature, rather, nature constant ubiquitous...
+ ...ergo, death is an integral part of true nature.
+ The increasingly extra-natural, quasi-immortal modern human
+ My Romantic Era poets' direct exposure to nature dominant versus our
  aloofness, estrangement from nature as planet-spatial.

I hold that our modern, twenty-first-century understanding of nature
is very different than Nature of early-nineteenth-century poets such
as William and Dorothy Wordsworth, or the Haworth and Amherst
Emilies.[fn:31] Alone the fact that our typical indoor living
environments today are more like modular, sealed /space stations/
plopped down on a hostile alien planet compared to the simpler, more
primitive structures of the not-so-distant past... Quite literally, the
Brontës' Haworth parsonage, built in 1778 out of local stone and wood
and clay, had more in common with human shelters from one, /two/
thousand years previous than with our modern suburban homes only some

Hence,

#+begin_quote
in just the past two to three hundred years a very steep, vertical
gradient or differential has grown between indoors and outdoors.
#+end_quote

This, in turn, has brought us to see nature more as a /place/ separate
and outside, cut off, away from our artificial, high-tech, controlled
and regulated modern indoor spaces[fn:32] ... which, in turn, has lead
us to rate /outdoors nature/ on continua of relative wildness and
remoteness from our sealed-off, self-contained, humans-only
environments. Indeed...

<span class="cap">Homespun and one of its sources. Original art from Steve-Lease (DeviantArt.com)</span>@@
@@html:</span>@@

Even as late as my own childhood the term /homespun/ was in use to
indicate a poor, unsophisticated person, a country bumkin, a hick from
the sticks. The term referred to a person's clothing being homemade
from locally-sourced, hand-spun and woven materials such as linen and
wool rather than factory-made retail clothing. The early-nineteenth
century Brontëan West Yorkshire would have seen the majority of the
villagers in homespun, all but a few garments not hand-tailored
bespoke.[fn:33] And of course food was entirely from local
production. Hence, a person's daily resources were overwhelmingly
local, a small bit perhaps coming from a nearby /market town/, while
only the most exotic items (e.g., a clock, a fine musical instrument)
would have come from farther away. Today, however, this supply pyramid
is completely flipped, as nearly everything comes from far (far!) away
(e.g. China), while only a few personal items would be from a local or
even regional source.[fn:34] And so in Brontëan times (first half of
the 1800s) the surrounding land was agriculturally domesticated, a
working partner. Contrast this with today's urban-suburban populations
hardly ever in contact with farmers or their farms. Nor do we know
anything about where our clothing came from. Today, nature as "the
land," as our immediate provider, has been completely abstracted into
concepts such as /ecosystems/, which implies we are now removed
observers controlling nature as if it were just another of our
mechanical objects.

No doubt we have always made a distinction between being /inside/ a
shelter and going /outside/ into the so-called /elements/. But
starting some six to ten thousand years ago we began to give up
aboriginal nomadic life and its direct daily contact with said
untamed, uncontrolled elements in order to establish permanent
city-states supported by mass monoculture agriculture. And so indoor
environments in ever-expanding urban centres became increasingly
physically removed, walled off from the wild natural world, becoming
evermore self-contained, all-encompassing, self-referencing, thus,
/recursively derivative/.[fn:35]

Along with this growing separation came mentalities, narratives
increasingly based indoors and /extra-natural/.[fn:36] Being indoors
meant we no longer were in direct contact with the nature spirits all
around; instead, praying to an extra-natural, off-world monotheistic
God in architectural showcase churches.[fn:37] Western architecture
seemed to reach a fantastical aesthetic crescendo in the Victorian
nineteenth century[fn:38], coinciding with an exponential growth in
urban population which had just passed an inflection point. Today the
steepness of our indoor-outdoor gradient has increased even more since
Victorian times ... resulting in a humanity more abstracted
/extra-natural/ than ever. How then may we, a species seemingly
capable of great adaptability, objectively measure our
separation from nature?

But then what is this human adaptability? I posit there are two sorts
of adaptability leading to,

 a) a permanent (beneficial) alteration, or
 b) a temporary adjustment, an allowance for less-that-optimal
    conditions, supposing an eventual return to optimal conditions.

We humans, I contend, are the second type of adaptable. This means we
are certainly no barometer species or "canary in the coal mine" of our
own well-being. We routinely ignore our fellow canary-like humans,
allowing them to suffer and die, their warnings unheeded. What has
domestic, urban, indoor living done to our brains, our sense of
belonging to the planet, to one another?  How can we even begin to
trace back the many rabbit hole bifurcations, the chain of derivatives
we've taken for all these centuries down and out and away from /nature
pure/?  To be sure, we have demonstrated a collective will to make
conditions better for us /and us alone/. We mainly see our dominion
over, abstraction away, separation from nature as fate, as
destiny. After all, our population doubling in less than fifty years
to eight billion[fn:39] says something to our intention and ability to
dominate. And we seem to have adapted our collective human psyche, our
narratives to this separation.[fn:40] /But is this sustainable?/ All
doomsday spinnings aside, many of us today have grown concerned over
the question of sustainability, concerned about our long arc of
estrangement from nature.[fn:41] Let me suggest a completely different
understanding of nature, namely---

#+begin_quote
Nature is not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature is everything going on everywhere. Nature is the myriad cycles
of *birth*, *growth*, *deterioration*, and *death* happening
everywhere all the time.
#+end_quote

I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, knew,
sensed this pre-modern meaning of nature as beyond inside or
outside. Yes, one went outside, out into the elements. But once back
indoors, a Brontë sister was not so completely out of and above
nature's touch, influence, /doom/ as we now fancy ourselves. Again,
the cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and especially death were
happening everywhere /sans emplacement/. Consider how the Industrial
Revolution created urban production landscapes vast and barren and so
completely devoid of any sort of nature, spatial or
otherwise---indeed, William Blake's "satanic mills." Here is what
Ludwig Klages in the late-1800s said

#+begin_quote
The face of the mainland has become a landscape of coerced
"Chicago-ifications" as humanity has fallen into an orgy of destruction
without precedence. So-called civilization wears the face of an
unleashed murderer, while the fullness, the bounty of the earth has
withered from his poisonous breath.
#+end_quote

This was a change on a scale never before seen, a huge and relatively
sudden step away from the physical world being solely the purveyance
of nature. And so even when the individual left his house he was still
deep within a massive concentration of extra-natural, human-exclusive
space and activity. Poverty in the pre-industrial rural landscape was
all but idyllic compared the grueling, grinding poverty of the
industrial cityscapes.[fn:42]

Here is an excerpt from Emily Brontë from her poem /Shall earth no more inspire thee/
where Mother Nature speaks directly to the wayward human

#+begin_verse
...
Thy mind is ever moving
In regions dark to thee;
Recall its useless roving—
Come back and dwell with me.
...
#+end_verse

I can't read this poem without having a very emotional
response. Indeed, the house of mirrors echo chamber that modern life
has become precludes any real adaptation. And so the choice is simple:
We can go back to nature /or/ continue our useless roving, which can
only lead to evermore alienation---from real Nature, as well as from
each other.

To be sure, so much ominous and doomsday has been said about mass
society in this modern industrialised world—all pointing to the
increasingly obvious fact that our vaunted adaptation skills are being
stretched to the breaking point, dysphoria increasing, ecological
collapse inevitable.

And again Emily Brontë, her epic /The night is darkening round me/

#+begin_verse
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow;
But a tyrant spell has bound me,
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;
The storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below;
But nothing drear can move me;
I will not, cannot go.
#+end_verse

Yes, she is outdoors "facing the elements," as we say. She even refers
to the wilds as "wastes" and as "drear."[fn:43] And yet she is
transfixed, frozen to the spot---and I cannot, cannot go, as she
says. Subjective terms like wastes and drear refer to the age-old
attitudes towards nature as a terrible, grim, inescapable master, a
sponsor of disaster and death, hardly over which to linger, let alone
wax poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that, and to be sure,
grandeur and sublimity expressed in lines of verse was the surprising
result. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared directly at
an enemy previously known as all-powerful and unforgiving, and in so
doing she sensed something deep and personally transformative. She was
stirred to write lines that, for me at least, are the very centre of
the mystery of Life, Death, and the Dark Muse.

Now, contrast Brontëan Nature with Ernest Hemingway's
twentieth-century nature. Hemingway and his contemporaries rambled
hither and yon, all over the globe trying to find the ultimate nature
experience. He shut down his emotions and senses and forced his will
upon nature, dominating these exotic locations to prove his worthiness
as a man.

But of course it was all just macho-man theatre. If anything serious
had happened to him he could have been airlifted out to receive modern
medical care. Not the Romantic Era poets, however, who were in harm's
way with no timeouts, no escape. Would Hemingway have done all those
macho-man things if there had been no modern world with modern medical
aid just a plane ride away? Haworth Emily lived in a time when
/nothing/ was modern, i.e., her West Yorkshire moorlands were
semi-wilderness, and early eighteenth-century medicine didn't even
know about germs.[fn:44] Literally, a cut on a toe could become
infected resulting in death in those times. Thus, nature for a Brontë
sister was not a contest, nor a show, nor a game.

With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around, the last two components, deterioration and
death, must be understood beyond our mechanistic reductionist modern
take of just physical malfunction.[fn:45] Back in the day, death was a
/force majeure/, but no longer thanks to modern medicine. It's almost
as if deterioration and death, two of nature's supposedly inescapable
realities, have been cordoned off---or at least placed under much
greater human control than ever before. /It's as if through modern
medicine we have begun to acquire a demi-godlike, proto-immortal veto
power over physical demise./ And with this control we have torn down,
dismantled a great component of spirituality, namely the reckoning of
one's mortality with a deity. Where once was supposed a /mortal/,
physical plane inferior an /immortal/ spiritual plane, we now would
believe only the physical plane to be relevant. And with this comes a
great psychic and spiritual impoverishment, the extent of which we
cannot fully know.

Though for the meantime death remains an undeniable certainty. Death
comes as it always has---from old age, fatal accident, or deadly
physical aggression or predation.[fn:46] But a completely different
attitude arises when modern healthcare's labyrinth of diagnoses,
drugs, procedures and surgeries routinely thwart what was once all but
certain, as well as swift demise. And so we've begun to lessen the
mystery of Death, overturn fate, consequence, and doom.

#+begin_verse
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
--- Psalm 90:10
#+end_verse

This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalistic,
absolute inevitability so resounding as to constantly shake and echo
through life. Death as life's backstop, container, timer, combinator,
reaper.[fn:47] And so I say, as death is interrupted, so are the
greater human cycles of emotion and spirituality interrupted.

Indeed, what if we start to take command of Death's appointment book,
rerouting, rescheduling Death's comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is
making the point that by no means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty
years of life, and even if we get them they might not be that
great. And yet we have grown to /expect/ from the implicit promises of
modern medical science a healthy, high-quality seventy, eighty,
ninety, or even more years. Again, modern medicine has disrupted the
two last components of a nature ubiquitous cyclic, i.e., deterioration
and death, thereby further collapsing our understanding of what true
nature is. Modern science has lessened the wallop of tragedy, weakened
overall the doominess of doom by redefining life as so much organic
machine circuitry, a mechanism that, in turn, is to be better and
better repaired, maintained, improved against entropic
wear-and-tear[fn:48].

Let me relate a modern story about our new attitude towards death. My
father, who has since passed away, lost his /third/ wife to lung
cancer caused inevitably by decades of smoking[fn:49]. But instead of
accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I finally theorised that he
had explicated from all the buzz of the various possible medical
interventions---including their probabilities of success or
failure---a hope that the death sentence of lung cancer could,
/should/ be beaten by some technology lurking in some corner of the
modern medical labyrinth. Alas...

Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed Death's arrival to
such an absurd degree. Human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of Death able to lap over at any time. But today
the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has become an all but
guaranteed minimum. Old age and death are increasingly spoken of as
"diseases" we can and should defeat. Death as a nuisance, indeed. My
father felt cheated when that three-, fourscore and more was not
forthcoming. But as you may anticipate, I contend life is life only
with Death---Death absolute and not easily pushed back, much less
obviated.

A sickly Anne Brontë[fn:50] on her final dying trip to Scarborough in
1849 had made a stop in York where she insisted on seeing the York
Minster. Upon gazing up at the great cathedral she said, "If finite
power can do this..."  But then she was overcome with emotion and fell
silent. Anne was in a deep and personal death mindset of utter and
complete humility and reverence. Indeed, God was in her death.

In my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/, which I will eventually discuss, I
have a character saying yes, she would get in a time machine and go
back the Brontëan times. But what if you faced a fifty-fifty chance of
dying from a now curable, fixable condition? her friend asks. Yes, she
replies, I would /trust/ my life, and /trust/ my death. Indeed. Who
can trust their death today?

*** Teenage Dickinson's cemetery visit

Allow me to insert a passage from a letter Emily Dickinson wrote to
her friend Abiah Root when she sixteen years of age. She describes a
visit to Boston and the first true American cemetery, Mount Auburn.[fn:51]

#+begin_quote
Have you ever been to Mount Auburn? If not, you can form but slight
conception of this "City of the Dead." It seems as if nature had
formed this spot with a distinct idea in view of its being a
resting-place for her children, where, wearied and disappointed, they
might stretch themselves beneath the spreading cypress, and close
their eyes "calmly as to a night's repose, or flower's at set of sun."
#+end_quote

...Amherst Emily feeling the Dark at sixteen years old, 1846.

** Death births German Romanticism: Novalis

#+begin_quote
The world must be romanticised. In this way we will find again its
primal meaning. Romanticising is nothing but raising to a higher power
in a qualitative sense. In this process the lower Self becomes
identified with a better Self ... When I give a lofty meaning to the
commonplace, a mysterious prestige to the usual, the dignity of the
unknown to the known, an aura of infinity to the finite, then I am
romanticising. For the higher, the unknown, the mystical, the
infinite, the process is reversed---these are---expressed in terms of
their logarithms by such a connection---they are--reduced to familiar
terms.
#+end_quote

This is an oft-cited quote from[fn:52] the German nobleman George
Philipp Friedrich /Freiherr/ (Baron) von Hardenberg (1772---1801), pen
name *Novalis*, who is considered to be the original muse of the
German Romantic Movement ... paralleling similar ideals and sentiments
in Britain,[fn:53] spreading quickly throughout the English-speaking
diaspora and the West in general. Specifically, his prose-poem cycle
/Hymns to the Night/ [fn:54] electrified people around him, initially
a gathering of German salon intellectuals in Jena, Thuringia,
Germany.[fn:55] These thinkers rallied around Novalis, whom they
adopted as a sort of savant mascot, building on /HttN/ and Novalis'
/poetising/, another term he used for the romanticising of
life. Indeed, what came to be known as Jena Romanticism[fn:56] spread
to eager circles and fertile grounds throughout the West. They raised
Novalis' idealisations of /Poesie/ [fn:57] as an all-embracing paradigm
to counter the cold, dehumanising, thus desensitising implications of
Enlightenment Age rationalism and determinism, as well as the
stultifying formalisms of Classicism. *Novalis sounded the charge to
/re-sensitise/ life.* Lots more on this later...

Alas, but here is where I become quite the iconoclast, primarily by
insisting /academe has Romanticism wrong!/[fn:58] Even Novalis' supporters,
his Jena contemporaries, yes, even Novalis himself seemed to lose the
thread and march about spouting dessicated
intellectualisations.[fn:59] I posit that Novalis with his
foundational /HttN/ took off like a sleepwalker towards the Dark
Muse. Thus, Romanticism, as subsequently cooked up by "experts" during
and after, became a bloated, overanalysed, theory-bound,
cart-before-the-horse disaster. Or I will simply say German
Romanticism began true but veered off into the ditch---all while
Wordsworthian English Romanticism really never had a Dark Muse to
begin with, except for Coleridge's gothic borrowings from the
eighteenth century.[fn:60]

I contend Romanticism was a spiritual cultural /force majeure/, like a
huge river breaking into multiple braided channels across a broad
landscape with little to say about it other than it was wet. And so my
whole point with WutheriingUK is to urge you to simply *read, sigh,
imbibe---repeat* and not follow any of the scholarly technocrats down
their musty rabbit holes where the spirit of it all suffocates. This
may seem naive context-free amateurish of me, but the alternative is
winding up lost and clueless as I believe the vast majority of
Romanticism scholars are. Academe Romanticism is truly the blind
leading the blind. But let's get to /HttN/...

Reading /HttN/ one cannot escape the sheer intensity of Novalis'
swoon-fest over Night and Death. Here is a small taste

#+begin_verse
I feel the flow of
Death's youth-giving flood;
To balsam and æther, it
Changes my blood!
I live all the daytime
In faith and in might:
And in holy rapture
I die every night.
#+end_verse

and just before came

#+begin_verse
What delight, what pleasure offers /thy/ life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night? Thy mother, it is she brings thee forth, and to her thou owest all thy glory.
#+end_verse

It my opinion /HttN/ is one of the densest, purest, most direct
attesting to the Dark Muse ever.[fn:61] As the legend tells, his
inspiration came from being grief-stricken at the death of his
fifteen-year-old fiancée Sophie von Kühn, to whose grave he made a
pilgrimage for one hundred nights. The Jena Set writer Ludwig Tieck
described the teenage Sophie

#+begin_quote
Even as a child, she gave an impression which---because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely---we must call super-earthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.
#+end_quote

Indeed, Sophie was a shining paragon of total human sensitisation
while on earth.[fn:62] And it was her death that threw Novalis into
trance, vision. /HttN/ was most certainly not just the gymnastics of
flipping the sacred to profane and profane to sacred as Novalis
described romanticising poetising. He journeyed into Night and came
back with some of the most compelling Dark ever. But then yawned open
this great abyss between producers and describer-promoters...[fn:63]

** John Keats' sense of Beauty

Samuel Taylor Coleridge is generally accepted as the leading
intellectualiser of British Romanticism during its inception roughly
parallel to the Jena Romantic liftoff. Following is a Coleridge quote
as good as any

#+begin_quote
...first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each
other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the
accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as
the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible
directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces
should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike
indestructible... this one power with its two inherent indestructible
yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which
their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and
the process of our own self-consciousness.
#+end_quote

Indeed, such wordy intellectualisations are the usual fodder seized
upon by academics whipping up copy. Again, Coleridge and
Wordsworth's /Lyrical Ballads/ is considered the cornerstone of
English Romanticism.[fn:64] Now, let us contrast this with what
English poet John Keats said years later in a 1817 letter to his
brothers George and Thomas

#+begin_quote
...I mean *Negative Capability*, that is, when a man is capable of
being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
reaching after fact and reason---Coleridge, for instance, would let go
by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of
mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with
half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no
further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty
overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all
consideration.
#+end_quote

Hard and fast ideas, logically circumscribed, battling it out for
supremacy, while feelings and impressions and what-ifs lost in the
ruckus ... intellectualisations, great and lengthy, especially of the
"Penetralium[fn:65] of mystery," just verisimilar[fn:66]
ramblings. Indeed, to /not/ immediately intellectualise, but to hold
oneself in a counter-intuitive state of unresolved---just to see where
it might lead.  Keats' /Negative Capability/ is about /cognitive
dissonance/ as a great and necessary burden the poet must carry, a
process key to deeper understanding beyond neat and tidy piles of
logical-seeming words to impress other don't-get-it people. Then with
his simple ode to Beauty the poet obviates, obliterates the sterility
of intellectualisation. Here is the famed beginning of his "poetic
romance" /Endymion/

#+begin_verse
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:
Its loveliness increases; it will never
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,
Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils
With the green world they live in; and clear rills
That for themselves a cooling covert make
'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms
We have imagined for the mighty dead;
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:
An endless fountain of immortal drink,
Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.
#+end_verse

Take that Coleridge, you brachial babbling braincase! Again, *read,
sigh, imbibe---repeat.* Let this sink in, dear reader.

In the 2009 film /Bright Star/, a touching verisimilar bio-drama about
Keats, there is a scene where, speaking to his love interest Fanny
Brawne, he says /A poet is not at all poetical. In fact, he the most
unpoetical thing in existence. He has no identity. He is continually
filling some other body---the sun, the moon./ He then says, /Poetic
craft is a carcass, a sham. *If poetry does not come as naturally as
leaves to a tree then it had better not come at all*./ And then Fanny
says, /I still don't know how to work out a poem./ To which Keats
says[fn:67]

#+begin_quote
A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving
in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the
lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not /work/ the
lake out. It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and
emboldens the soul to accept mystery.
#+end_quote

And thus, I would posit he, like I, did not see Romanticism as
something needs bundling and explaining and stuck with labels and
herded into categories. The point of hearing birdsong is not to think
about male birds warding off other males while trying to appeal to
females, but to luxuriate in the wonderful chorus of nature. Time and
time again I listen to or read a description of Romanticism and come
away with the feeling the scholar, the author understands nothing,
rather, is simply stringing disparate bits and bobs together towards
some verisimilitude of a penetralia they don't really get,
understand. And so I say the intellectual prison in which academe has
stuck Romanticism should be opened up, the guards soundly switched and
run off, the prisoners let back out into the wide fields and deep
woods.

** Thriving versus surviving; top dog versus underdog

In his book /The Genius of Instinct/ [fn:68] author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to /thrive/, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, but wait,
haven't these bats jumped /outside/ of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of /trans/-bat-ism. But is that a good thing?
In the meantime the bats profit. But for nature as a whole? In effect,
the bats have short-circuited their doom, their fate. Again, what are
the real long-term consequences?

Perhaps bats doing better is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis
the rest of their competitors and surrounding environment.[fn:69] And
yet what happens when a species keeps thriving more and more,
increasing its success statistics, stepping over, beyond any of the
natural restrictions that real integration and harmony with nature
would have required? *Aren't we humans Exhibit A of just such an
out-of-control species?* And so I ask, how can all this so-called
thriving be good, end well?  How can a dominant species like
ours---which always seems to be "gaming the system," evermore
ingeniously and aggressively extra-natural---not eventually have to
pay some price? Simply put, How can more and more people consuming
more and more resources and energy, each of us fantasising about
success and prosperity, not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?

Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to its tightly integrated niche, then
exponential growth ensues---which eventually must hit an inflexion
point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards an
inevitable overshoot and crash.

To my mind, Emily Brontë was just this sort of hard-pressed little bat
out in the wilds---colony-less, huddled in a hollow tree, barely eking
out a marginal life. Here is her /Plead for me/

#+begin_verse
Why I have persevered to shun
The common paths that others run;
And on a strange road journeyed on
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.

These once indeed seemed Beings divine,
And they perchance heard vows of mine
And saw my offerings on their shrine—
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,
And mine were worthily despised;

My Darling Pain that wounds and sears
And wrings a blessing out from tears
By deadening me to real cares;
And yet, a king---though prudence well
Have taught thy subject to rebel.

And am I wrong to worship where
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me
And tell why I have chosen thee!
#+end_verse

I consider this her ode to skipping the trans-human thrive scene of
her day and striking out into some Beyond to commune with her God of
Visions. Again, I must believe she was a little bat fluttering across
the semi-wilderness moorland, as true an existential /underdog/, an
equal of all the other underdog wild critters, as was still possible
back then.

Compare this with today's outdoor adventurer who clad in his technical
gear from REI, Patagonia, North Face, drives to government set-aside
wilds such as the Smokies mentioned above in a four-wheel-drive Jeep
Cherokee, consumes protein bars and electrolyte drinks, listens to
music with earbuds, takes smart phone pictures and GoPro videos. Any
mishaps? Call for immediate helicopter rescue on the iPhone satellite
connection... At some point we're just amateur Earth astronauts, no?
When nature is truly in balance, all participants are underdogs to
some degree. But we modern humans have demanded and gained total
dominance over nature.

Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced malnutrition, contaminated
water, tuberculosis---pick one, two, or all three---five months
after her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the greater world outside
of her tiny Haworth village and its surrounding hills for a few
months.[fn:70] As I've said, hers was a world containing nothing
modern as we know it, e.g., a cut on a toe could lead to an infection
requiring amputation, or even worse.

And yet one might insist her existence in the early nineteen century
was not really so very wild and rugged. Was she still not observing
nature from civilization's relative place of safety, thereby rendering
her observations just as tainted, just as removed and relative as ours
today? I say no. Clearly our modern place of safety is so much greater
than hers, as we of the twenty-first century float above cruel Nature
on unprecedented levels of high-tech materialism.[fn:71] I contend
hers was a unique vantage point, neither too exposed nor removed from
elemental nature.

Still, I'm often confronted with modern scoffers who believe Romantic
Era poets only knew nature from picnics held at country estates where
dandies and their pampered ladies were attended by servants, as seen,
for example, in Hollywood film versions of Jane Austen's /Emma/[fn:72]

Again, for us moderns nature is a /place/, a /location/ away from and
diametrically opposite our modern interior spaces. Nature today is
seen as this vast other place, the /Great Outdoors/. Therefore, the
farther afield from modern civilization we can go, the truer and more
authentic nature supposedly becomes. And so we create a /nature
continuum/ whereby a trackless wilderness as far from civilization as
possible is the truest nature, while hardly nature at all would be a
weedy ditch behind a triple-paned windowed, vinyl-siding-clad,
forced-air-HVAC suburban house. Nature can only be very wild, thus,
very far away from the safety of our space-colony civilization. But
let me again be blunt: We do not get more nature simply because we
have gone like explorer astronauts way farther out from our sterile,
artificial exclusively human home base. /Nature is not something close
or remote/.

It is precisely because we have spoiled so much of our proximate
places that we elevate far-afield wilderness to a practically
quasi-off-planet status. Writers like Ernest Hemingway and Jack London
exploit fright memes of Nature as a distant, exotic, hostile place
... again, virtually identical to science fiction stories of strange,
hostile, dangerous, alien planets conquered by brave, intrepid
astronauts. To be sure, many sci-fi depictions of alien worlds are
interchangeable with the Klondike Yukon that London described.

No, my poets of the so-called Romantic Era were not pampered dandies
with their fine ladies strolling for a few bored minutes on manicured
estate grounds. Nor were they "white privilege" beneficiaries of the
"Age of Exploration" colonialism. My poets were mainly short-lived
little bats in their crevasses and corners, as pressed as any bats
have ever been.

** Eighteenth-century British Dark

As alluded above, the world was seeing Dark decades before Novalis and
German Romanticism, specifically eighteenth-century Britain and its
/gothic movement/, first, the doom-and-gloom /Graveyard School/ of
poetry. After Graveyard, just past mid-century came the /gothic novel/
with arguably a more formulaic doom-and-gloom. But then came what
might be called the /Night School/, which became the basis of my dark
corner of Romanticism.

*** The Graveyard School

It was only a few decades into the eighteenth century when there
emerged in Britain a style of poetry which has since been named the
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_poets][Graveyard School]]/. As I do with Novalis and his /HttN/, I can't help
but believe these English Graveyarders were more sleepwalkers than any
sort of intentional movement leaders. My Exhibit A of Graveyard is
Edward Young's epic-length /[[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33156/33156-h/33156-h.htm][The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts on Life,
Death, & Immortality]]/ (or simply /Night-Thoughts/,
ca. 1742-1745).[fn:73] Bursting with a grandiosity only poetry can
reach, Young relentlessly spins out darkness and doom. To be sure, he
is Dark with a shudder, full of fright memes meant to weigh down and
ultimately defeat---if taken seriously. A quick taste

#+begin_verse
"When the cock crew, he wept”---smote by that eye
Which looks on me, on all: that Power, who bids
This midnight sentinel, with clarion shrill
(Emblem of that which shall awake the dead),
Rouse souls from slumber, into thoughts of heaven.
Shall I too weep? Where then is fortitude?
And, fortitude abandon’d, where is man?
I know the terms on which he sees the light;
He that is born, is listed; life is war;
Eternal war with woe. Who bears it best,
Deserves it least...
#+end_verse

...indeed, unrelenting doom and woe. Typical of Graveyard School,
there is no hope, no escape, just the weight of an assumed curse
(ultimately original sin?), then processions of lamentation to cliff
edges and fated tumbling thereoff

#+begin_verse
Art, brainless Art! our furious charioteer...
...Drives headlong towards the precipice of death;
Death, most our dread; death thus more dreadful made:
Oh, what a riddle of absurdity!
#+end_verse

or

#+begin_verse
From short (as usual) and disturb’d repose,
I wake: how happy they, who wake no more!
Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave.
I wake, emerging from a sea of dreams
Tumultuous; where my wreck’d desponding thought
From wave to wave of fancied misery
At random drove...
#+end_verse

Of course every student of the Dark Muse should read Young's
/Night-thoughts/. And yet this over-the-top doom hyperbole will
eventually deliver even the most indulgent reader to incredulity. Dare
I say at some point it becomes farce.[fn:74] Though Graveyard had a
more contemplative, measured side. For example, Thomas Gray's /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44299/elegy-written-in-a-country-churchyard][Elegy
Written in a Country Churchyard]]/ (1751). To be sure, the eulogising of
the dead is a much older and well established genre, typically
emphasising the qualities of the deceased over the dark, eternal abyss
his grave might represent. While we're not meant to survive Young's
pounding, Gray's elegy of a lost friend is Dark and fatalist and yet
reverent and faithful

#+begin_verse
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,
Heav'n did a recompense as largely send:
He gave to Mis'ry all he had, a tear,
He gain'd from Heav'n ('twas all he wish'd) a friend.
#+end_verse

Here, whatever negatives---morose out to sinister doom---may be
swirling about, God in his heavenly domain has our backs. Gray doesn't
try to beat us down as much as did the hardcore Graveyard
Schoolers. And yet with Graveyard, Britain had arrived at a public
exhibition of Dark.

Where did all this come from? Was Dark simply in the air? As I will
always insist about the Dark Muse in general, Graveyard arrived
unexpected, a natural, organic upwelling---however inelegant its
expression. Which begs the question, What rises to cultural and
intellectual prominence in an age?[fn:75] To be sure, many of that era
condemned gothic and Graveyard as subculture. But eventually came a
refinement, which I might call the /Night School/. Though intervening
was the /gothic novel/, which we will now investigate.

*** The arrival of the /gothic novel/

Prose versus poetry. In the past poetry was seen by members of polite
society as the higher, the acceptable form of literature. For example,
Germany has long been referred to as the land of /poets/ and
/thinkers/.[fn:76] Prose in the form of the novel,[fn:77] on the other
hand, was not acceptable, seen as too revealing invasive personal,
i.e., it is improper, unseemly, distasteful to expose even an
imaginary person's life details in such an open and revealing
fashion. Thus, according to this attitude, it was a crude thing to so
freely fantasise human goings-on in a fictitious way. Rather,
literature must ennoble the human as a being created in the likeness
of God, and not dwell on his mundanity and failings. After all, a
novel was neither factual (e.g. a saint's hagiography) nor high
lyrical poetic (e.g., church hymn lyrics or /Heldenlieder/). A
novel/roman was simply too plain-spoken, i.e., the unavoidable clarity
of straight descriptive writing invariably generated an undesirable
ordinariness. And so it was in this mise en scène that the prose novel
bumped along post-Medieval Age as a barely tolerated corruption of
writing, as a regrettable parallel to poetry, consumed mainly by
easily excited arriviste vulgarian middle-class women. But then as the
middle class grew in power and numbers, the novel came to the fore,
especially in the eighteenth century.[fn:78]

Modern academe considers the novel /The Castle of Otranto, A Gothic
Story/, appearing in its first edition in 1764, to be the official
start of British /gothic/ literature.[fn:79] Written by the excentric,
iconoclastic English nobleman Horace Walpole (1717 – 1797), /Otranto/
is a melodrama set in sixteenth-century Naples offering slumming
readers a big dose of darkness, doom, and woe. Walpole's penchant for
medievalism rode the long-simmering nostalgic idealisation of the
Medieval Age[fn:80], while the adjective /gothic/ referred to medieval
Gothic architecture.[fn:81] Gothic "horror" was an instant hit, and
other writers and influencers quickly joined in creating a full-on
gothic literature movement.[fn:82]

The popularity of the gothic novel continued throughout the nineteenth
and into the twentieth century primarily in the romance genre---after
the term romance had been twisted in meaning to mean love. Among
others, Frances Parkinson Keyes (1885 – 1970) was a popular romance
author who often wrote from a gothic perspective. /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonwyck_(film)][Dragonwyck]]/ (1946)
is a prime example of Hollywood[fn:83] does gothic romance.

<span class="cap">Wolf's Crag from Walter Scott's gothic <i>The Bride of Lammermore</i> </span>
#+end_export

Above is an etching from a publication of Sir Walter Scott's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_of_Lammermoor][The
Bride of Lammermore]]/ (1819). Consider the sheer visual density and
heaviness of the scene (click on the image to be taken to a larger
version). /Whence, wherefore/ this heaviness, this portent?
Predominant is nature dark, inhospitable, threatening. The human-built
castle is primitive, isolated, and vulnerable, the riders miniscule,
exposed ... as though every single living cell---plant, animal,
human---is clinging to life by a thread, and any dim green and blue
hues of vegetation and sea are wholly irrelevant. The scene evokes
danger, dysphoria, as if surely something horrific just waiting to
transpire. But again how, why? Why such darkness and what was (and
still is) the appeal? Hitchcock tautologies aside, modern academe has
offered theories about the socio-political-psychological landscape of
the times, and yet these "experts" only sound supercilious and
patronising from their modern triumphalist perches, as if they are
searching for a disease to explain a malady, weakness to explain
indulgence. No, indeed, Dark, even when crude and heavy, predominates,
arrests, mystifies, the appeal all the stronger for its recessive,
ungraspable spherical symmetry. To be sure, this "coming out" of
gothic in the eighteenth century was overwrought, indulgent with its
fright memes, but undeniably popular and onto something real about the
inner human experience---at least in the Western world of the day.

*** The night, the stars, the moon...

As personal and original as I want Novalis' /Hymns to the Night/ to
have been, I insist Englishwoman Anna Lætitia Barbauld's /[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_(Barbauld)/A_Summer_Evening%27s_Meditation][A Summer
Evening's Meditation]]/ was the same inner outing, already having
appeared in 1773, praising the night in a similarly cherished, solemn
way.

Without more investigation I have no real idea if Barbauld's /ASEM/,
weighing in at 124 lines, started what I'm calling the /Night School/,
but as a working theory, yes, she offered a new perspective on Dark
with an accessibility and maturity not really seen in Graveyard and
certainly not gothic horror. As a sort of prompt she nods to Young's
/Night-thoughts/ with the quote, /One sun by day, by night ten
thousand shine/, then launches directly into her summer night and its
canopy of stars...

#+begin_verse
Tis past! The sultry tyrant of the south
Has spent his short-liv'd rage; more grateful hours
Move silent on; the skies no more repel
The dazzled sight, but with mild maiden beams
Of temper'd light, invite the cherish'd eye
To wander o'er their sphere; where hung aloft
Dian's bright crescent, like a silver bow
New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns
Impatient for the night, and seems to push
Her brother down the sky. Fair Venus shines
E'en in the eye of day; with sweetest beam
Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood
Of soften'd radiance from her dewy locks.
The shadows spread apace; while meeken'd Eve
Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires
Thro' the Hesperian gardens of the west,
And shuts the gates of day. 'Tis now the hour
When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,
#+end_verse

No woe, no doom-and-gloom; instead, a relentless parade of visceral
and natural Dark hyperconductivity. Barbauld hauls us outdoors to
partake, imbibe, behold. We are not swimming in doom, rather, we are
touched, moved to reflect in reverence---

#+begin_verse
...But are they silent all? or is there not
A tongue in every star that talks with man,
And wooes him to be wife; nor wooes in vain:
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.
At this still hour the self-collected soul
Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there
Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;
An embryo God; a spark of fire divine,
Which must burn on for ages, when the sun,
(Fair transitory creature of a day!)
Has clos'd his golden eye, and wrap'd in shades
Forgets his wonted journey thro' the east.
#+end_verse

Night over day. Night a more expansive, passive, more nuanced interim
inviting deeper, more mature human introspection. Far distant, cool
and gentle are the myriad stars of a summer's eve, unlike our single
oversized and often ruinous local star of day. And here is some of my
own doggerel called /From a Grandniece To Her Great-aunt At Her
Great-uncle’s Funeral/

#+begin_verse
You see, dear Auntie, 
Day is all supposes, 
Night but only a few.
Night quietly closes 
Day’s great to-do.
Lost on the Day,
I wait for deepest Night,
for Darkness and I must
Decline clamant Light. 
#+end_verse
  
I should say this is my kind of Dark, i.e., free of any campy fright
devices---fun as they may be. Most assuredly every protégé of the Dark
Muse must read Barbauld's masterpiece. Hers is an exposition of
natural darkness, placing it far above the reproach of gothic horror
detractors. Though /ASEM/ was as far as I can tell a singleton, a
unicorn whose influence seemed to lay dormant for decades.[fn:84] One
Barbauld biographer mentioned a trend of that time of ladies studying
astronomy. But obviously Barbauld is waxing Dark, not embellishing
celestial bodies. Perusing her other poems, yes, she often dwells on
nature, sometimes in a dusky way, but addressing Dark as she did with
/ASEM/ doesn't come forth again, nor from others during her
times. Today she is known as an influential social commentator,
moralist, and educator, not as proto-Romanticism. And so I must jump
ahead some /fifty/ years and bring in Brontëan poetry as a
continuation of this Night School thread. Haworth Emily's /[[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Poems_of_Emily_Bront%C3%AB/Stars][Stars]]/ is
just one her many examples of Night School from someone who probably
had never read nor heard of Barbauld's /ASEM/. Exactly like Barbauld,
in /Stars/ Haworth Emily lauds the night and its starry sky

#+begin_verse
Thought followed thought, star followed star
Through boundless regions, on;
While one sweet influence, near and far,
Thrilled through, and proved us one!

Why did the morning dawn to break
So great, so pure, a spell;
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,
Where your cool radiance fell?
#+end_verse

The night sky's depth and expanse over the trammels of life during
sunlight, indeed. And so the last two stanzas

#+begin_verse
Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night;
Oh, night and stars, return!
And hide me from the hostile light
That does not warm, but burn;

That drains the blood of suffering men;
Drinks tears, instead of dew;
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,
And only wake with you!
#+end_verse

Night School redeems Dark by pulling it out of the ostentatiousness,
the gimmickry of Graveyard and gothic. Started by Barbauld, it was
independently embraced by others. Let's look at sister Anne Brontë's
/Night/

#+begin_verse
I love the silent hour of night,
For blissful dreams may then arise,
Revealing to my charmed sight
What may not bless my waking eyes.

And then a voice may meet my ear,
That death has silenced long ago;
And hope and rapture may appear
Instead of solitude and woe.

Cold in the grave for years has lain
The form it was my bliss to see;
And only dreams can bring again,
The darling of my heart to me.
#+end_verse

Simpler, more measured was Anne's poetry than her sister's. And she
includes the grave by eulogising either of her older sisters Maria or
Elizabeth, or her mother, but again, sans drama.

This calmer, more introspective Dark dominated the eighteenth
century. And let us not forget the many poems devoted to the
moon. Here is Anne Brontë's /Fluctuations/

#+begin_verse
What though the Sun had left my sky;
To save me from despair
The blessed Moon arose on high,
And shone serenely there.

I watched her, with a tearful gaze,
Rise slowly o'er the hill,
While through the dim horizon's haze
Her light gleamed faint and chill.

I thought such wan and lifeless beams
Could ne'er my heart repay
For the bright sun's most transient gleams
That cheered me through the day:

But, as above that mist's control
She rose, and brighter shone,
I felt her light upon my soul;
But now—that light is gone!

Thick vapours snatched her from my sight,
And I was darkling left,
All in the cold and gloomy night,
Of light and hope bereft:

Until, methought, a little star
Shone forth with trembling ray,
To cheer me with its light afar—
But that, too, passed away.

Anon, an earthly meteor blazed
The gloomy darkness through;
I smiled, yet trembled while I gazed—
But that soon vanished too!

And darker, drearier fell the night
Upon my spirit then;—
But what is that faint struggling light?
Is it the Moon again?

Kind Heaven! increase that silvery gleam
And bid these clouds depart,
And let her soft celestial beam
Restore my fainting heart!
#+end_verse

Here we may imagine the youngest Brontë bowed if not weighed down by
her earthly afflictions, cares, deprivations, but then in this lean,
hungry, susceptible state caught in an emotional whirling, carried,
borne up by the natural nighttime procession of sun to moon and
stars. She speaks of her tearful gaze, her fainting heart, her
spirits, her emotional exposure. She is a vulnerable ward of nature,
but tenaciously pursuant of its subtleties. Indeed, back then it was
always subtleties, delicate qualities found in nature by the
vulnerable if not pathetic human, an exacting counting of seemingly
modest blessings which then gained sublime ascendency.

If I wasn't pledged to Emily, I might say Anne has an even finer take
on Dark than her older sister. I might dare to say Anne's Christianity
is more conventional, whereas Emily with her obvious
thought-behind-thoughts mental state took a starker, more fatalist view of
God. Anne humble, Emily defiant perhaps; *nevertheless, the Dark Muse
absolutely owned by these Brontës!*

William Wordsworth was nearly always about Nature, as well as
all his foundational Romanticist ideals. In his /A Night Thought/
(published 1837) he clearly intersects with Night School

#+begin_verse
Lo! where the Moon along the sky
Sails with her happy destiny;
Oft is she hid from mortal eye
Or dimly seen,
But when the clouds asunder fly
How bright her mien!

Far different we---a froward race,
Thousands though rich in Fortune's grace
With cherished sullenness of pace
Their way pursue,
Ingrates who wear a smileless face
The whole year through.

If kindred humours e'er would make
My spirit droop for drooping's sake,
From Fancy following in thy wake,
Bright ship of heaven!
A counter impulse let me take
And be forgiven.
#+end_verse

Moon and Night would simply be another aspect of didactic Nature,
though he does allude to the more mature subtlety brought by the
darkness. He is clearly Night School in his /To the Moon/, here the
second stanza

#+begin_verse
The aspiring Mountains and the winding Streams,
Empress of Night! are gladdened by thy beams;
A look of thine the wilderness pervades,
And penetrates the forest's inmost shades;
Thou, chequering peaceably the minster's gloom,
Guid'st the pale Mourner to the lost one's tomb;
Canst reach the Prisoner---to his grated cell
Welcome, though silent and intangible!---
And lives there one, of all that come and go
On the great waters toiling to and fro,
One, who has watched thee at some quiet hour
Enthroned aloft in undisputed power,
Or crossed by vapoury streaks and clouds that move
Catching the lustre they in part reprove---
Nor sometimes felt a fitness in thy sway
To call up thoughts that shun the glare of day,
And make the serious happier than the gay?
#+end_verse

Allow me to mention another Night Schooler, namely, the Swiss poet
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Keller][Gottfried Keller]]. Again, he is even later by some three or four
decades than the Brontës or Wordsworth. Here is his /Winternacht/ or
/Winter Night/

#+begin_verse
Not a wingbeat went through the world;
silent and brilliant lay the white snow.
Not a puff of cloud hung in the starry canopy,
no wave surged in the torpid lake.
 
From the depths climbed a lake-tree,
to its crown encased in ice;
and upon its branches climbed the water nymph,
gazing up through the green ice.
 
There I stood upon the thin glass
that separated me from the black depths;
Close beneath my feet I saw
her white beauty, limb for limb.
 
With smothered sorrow she groped
here and there on the hard barrier.
Never will I will forget her dark expression;
always, always, shall it remain in my mind!
#+end_verse

One of my favourites, I have always wondered what the protagonist did
with the rest of his life. Did he return to the lake trying to find
his water nymph; or did he resign himself to his mortal and mundane
life? In any event, the mystery and allure of a forest in deep winter
night is undeniable. Such magic and mystery obviously could not have
occurred in daylight. Like Edgar Allan Poe's /The Raven/, which we
will discuss below, there is a melancholy over loss.

With Night School first there is Nature dark, then human reflection
upon that natural Dark; indeed, just the deepest possible descriptions
of the world in darkness bringing forth some of humanity's finest
insights.

** Romanticism

If a group of people enter a restaurant together the maître d' will
assume they are together and require a table together. This is a good
analogy to what has happened to my Dark principals. I have a lot to
say about what has come to be known as /Romanticism/ since it is the
catch-all created during and solidified after the main time frame of
my Dark principals to make them some coterie they certainly were not.

By now the reader knows I want my principals to have come by their
sublime poetry "as naturally as leaves came to a tree," as the film
/Bright Star/'s Keats said. To be sure, I insist my visionaries were
just that, timeless trance visionary, who might have time, geography,
and ethnicity in common, but cannot be made out a product thereof. I
cannot have them reduced to puppets dangling on strings connected,
owing to proto-this or precursor-that on the factory assembly line of
time.[fn:85] Yes, of course they were of their times, and yet
outliers, outsiders, unicorns, not for lumping together or lining up
on a labelled shelf. And as said above, their actual lives give little
insight into their gifts. Still, we have this most /unnatural/ box,
this clammy container created by both contemporaries during the day,
then subsequent generations of academe to hold, control, own, to
/jail/ my greats, this /Romanticism/. But labelling is convenient, at
times even necessary. And yet I must continue to argue what a disaster
has become of herding the ghosts of my heroes onto some latter-day
scholar's stage, a Fata Morgana that really never existed as all the
pendants want it to have. Again, gripping butterflies squashes
them.[fn:86] Right. We shall use the term carefully...

*** Feelings, emotions, innocence, nature ... anything else?

Academe typically begins any a priori deductive or empirical inductive
proof session of Abstract Topological Romanticism with this set of
axiomatic equations.[fn:87]

\begin{align*}
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{feelings}} \\
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{emotions}} \\
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{innocence}} \\
\large{\text{Romanticism}} &= \large{\text{nature}}
\end{align*}

Academe wants Romanticism a spirited anti-rationalist (unrational,
disrational, irrational?), predominantly vernal youthful /revolt/
against the soulless straitjacket, the failed humanism of
Enlightenment logic, as well as against stodgy, urban-centric
classicism---basically anything coming before. Like hallucinating AI
chatbots, scholars spin, and tangle bundles of cords and wires,
connecting up Descartes, Rousseau, the American and French
Revolutions, Defoe, Spinoza, Shakespeare,[fn:88] ... Buddha, Jesus,
Merlin, the pope, et cetera, et cetera, to form a massive grid of
vertices and edges spreading out over the near and distant past, the
denser, the more far-fetched the better. But of course all of this
microscopic literary DNA matching is happening long after the fact in
a modern realism setting, separate, aloof---clueless. What was an
intuitive, gut-level, all but spontaneous reaction to the
deterministic dogma rising from, say, Newton and before, Francis
Bacon, has become a tossed salad of imagined influences and
intentionalities.

And then always their usual suspects
roundup---anachronistically-tagged proto-hippie, back-to-nature,
right-brain iconoclast types doing anti-Establishment.[fn:89] And so
Novalis' /poetising/, where the mundane is flipped mysterious sacred
and the sacred flipped ordinary profane, becomes a formulaic lab
procedure conducted by contrarian irrationalists, rather than
visionaries spinning gold out of trances. The upshot is, an artistic
paper airplane floating around on feelings and emotions was folded and
set sailing. Isaiah Berlin described Romanticism as

+ a new and restless spirit, seeking /violently/ to burst through old
  and cramping forms,[fn:90]
+ a /nervous/ preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of
  consciousness,
+ a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual
  movement and change,
+ an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life,
+ a /passionate/ effort at self-assertion both individual and
  collective,
+ a search after means of expressing an /unappeasable yearning for
  unattainable goals/.

Especially the last point makes my heroes sound like children who want
everything in the candy shop.[fn:91] More discerning, an
intentionality is implied which my principals most certainly did not
bring---leading us once more to the disjunction between latter-day
professional analysts and the original grave-mute creators. But then
the question Berlin raised at the beginning of his /The Roots of
Romanticism/, namely, whether this was really a movement at all---or
just a collective condition, a state of mind that is always "in the
air," to emerge and then fade like virtual quantum particles blinking
in and out of existence.

But again my question: Where is Dark in any academe Romanticism?  And
no, I don't mean campy pop gothic. The feelings and emotions Haworth
Emily describe in /Fall leaves fall/

#+begin_verse
...I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse

do not appear in any known academic treatment of Romanticism, forcing
me through this manifesto to start over from scratch. Again, /Emily is
not just flipping!/ When I read these lines, yes, they are words
processed by my brain's logical language model, but then they go to
feelings. This is a quasi-[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron][mirror neuron]] "yes, I feel this way too"
moment that gives me pause and transports me once again to the gates
of the Dark Muse. /Fall leaves fall/ is terminal---I imbibe, feel, and
go forth, i.e., I /behold/ all this sublime ideation of darkness and
allow it to carry me---and that's it! Haworth Emily infects me with
contagion, and I too smile and sing along with her.

We all follow logically-set plans in our lives, locigally-derived
"goals." But we are always emotional, constantly assessing how we
/feel/ about this or that, things in general. This is what I might
call the /logic train/ and the /emotion braid/. Then when I read /Fall
leaves fall/ my braid of emotions stretching back to my birth (or even
further) swells and lifts me beyond my mundane, deterministic logic
train. And it is exactly this mirroring and swelling that academe
doesn't get, never catches onto. Wreathes of snow and night's decay
overshadow my clear, well-lit logic track.[fn:92] But a new sight
emerges, informed by my emotional faculties. And so when dealing with
academe's cutting around on Romanticism I must, as Amherst Emily said,
/beware of the surgeon with his knife, lest he find the culprit life/.

*** Nature reduced to sentimentality and innocence

The indoorsmen of academe never fail to raise /nature/ up as a
hallmark of Romanticism. Nature, nature, nature they repeat---but with
only the most patronising view of what it meant to my
principals. Nature what? Nature awareness, appreciation, adulation,
respect, idealisation, idolisation, rapture, fervour, worship? Nature
as a metaphor supply closet, a source of inspiration, a cruel
mistress, a loving mother. All of this gets batted around endlessly,
again, making my principals seem soppy, dreamy, sentimental, their
lines see-through by modernist grownups. They don't understand Nature
as I described it above, i.e., a non-place; instead, constant
everything everywhere cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
Death.

Academe's favourite Romanticism nature boy is of course William
Wordsworth, whom so many call Romanticism's godfather[fn:93]---but
then routinely pan as sappy sentimental. Beholden to the modern age,
its urban nihilist public, not to mention peer reviewers, academe
would use as touchstones modern realist writers such as Jack London
and Ernest Hemingway and their supposedly more objective and
unvarnished, /truer/ understanding of nature. What Wordsworth said
about wandering like a cloud then going nuts over daffodils is curious
but affected, mushy and maudlin to them

#+begin_verse
I wandered lonely as a cloud
That floats on high o'er vales and hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host, of golden daffodils;
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine
And twinkle on the milky way,
They stretched in never-ending line
Along the margin of a bay:
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced; but they
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
A poet could not but be gay,
In such a jocund company:
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie
In vacant or in pensive mood,
They flash upon that inward eye
Which is the bliss of solitude;
And then my heart with pleasure fills,
And dances with the daffodils.
#+end_verse

Eye rolls, smirks, and tsk-tsking in today's English department
classrooms. The richer his waxing, the further he sinks into
patronisation and condemnation by modern realists. Missed entirely is
his subtle and sublime. Here from /Lines Written a Few Miles above
Tintern Abbey/

#+begin_verse
...Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,
In which the burthen of the mystery,
In which the heavy and the weary weight
Of all this unintelligible world,
Is lightened:---that serene and blessed mood,
In which the affections gently lead us on,---
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame
And even the motion of our human blood
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep
In body, and become a living soul:
While with an eye made quiet by the power
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,
We see into the life of things.
#+end_verse

This of course is genial and goes to the heart and soul of what I want
to bring forth here at WutheringUK, even though he hasn't included
Dark. With words he causes vibrations to my emotion braid. But again,
all this goes way over heads and contrary to agendae today.[fn:94]
And so Wordsworth is just a dusty old statue glimpsed during a quick
run-through the classic wing of a museum, more interesting, better
things in the modern wing for sure.

Worse, Wordsworth made nature the only possible house for human purity
and innocence. How droll. In /To a Highland Girl/ he transforms a
peasant shepherdess he saw on a trip to Scotland into a goddess

#+begin_verse
...With earnest feeling I shall pray
For thee when I am far away:
For never saw I mien, or face,
In which more plainly I could trace
Benignity and home-bred sense
Ripening in perfect innocence.
#+end_verse

I guess you had to have been there. Again, as William lit up my
emotion bundle I was.

And so nature is never more than a /theme/, a /leitmotif/---bereft of
any clue as to what Nature capitalised meant.[fn:95] Nature conducive
to feelings and innocence, as so much of Romanticist poetry is someone
describing what they /feel/ and /yearn/ while in /nature/. Especially
with the Romanticist bond between feelings and nature do we see
academe as scoffers and put-down artists.




If one rejects metaphysics in all forms, then Nature is without
magic.[fn:96]

Often, Nature is simply reverently noted in verse, as does Anne Brontë
in her /Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day/

#+begin_verse
My soul is awakened, my spirit is soaring
And carried aloft on the wings of the breeze;
For above and around me the wild wind is roaring,
Arousing to rapture the earth and the seas.

The long withered grass in the sunshine is glancing,
The bare trees are tossing their branches on high;
The dead leaves beneath them are merrily dancing,
The white clouds are scudding across the blue sky

I wish I could see how the ocean is lashing
The foam of its billows to whirlwinds of spray;
I wish I could see how its proud waves are dashing,
And hear the wild roar of their thunder to-day!
#+end_verse

I will posit that my principals were instinctively unknowingly,
belatedly stamping a new European nature worship out of the moors and
forest floors---necessarily independent of whatever had been the
vernacular paganisms before Roman occupation. Orthogonal as well to
Elizabethan pastoral lyric, German /Shepherd Poetry/ of the
post-Thirty Years War seventeenth century, or even the Greek Arcadian
/Bucolic/ tradition.

Yes, Nature, but again, capitalised. Then we must explore---probably
for the rest of our lives---how very nuanced their Nature was. Here is
a quote from Haworth Emily

#+begin_quote
All creation is equally mad. Nature is an inexplicable problem; it
exists on a principle of destruction. Every being must be the tireless
instrument of death to others, or itself must cease to live. Yet
nonetheless we celebrate the day of our birth, and we praise God for
having entered such a world.
#+end_quote

Below I will dive into the three poems which I believe describe her
credo cosmology best. And, again, her Nature is completely different
from any modern ideas thereof.

*** Sensitivity

Academe wants my principals to have been more in tune with their
senses, more impulsive, less emotionally structured, even sensual. But
once more their approach comes off as patronising, like child
psychologists trying to describe children at play. The doctors know
"unruly" won't do, so they euphemize cleverly. To be sure, they just
don't get what it is to be instinctual. And as ivory tower residents
embedded securely in society, they cannot fathom being an /outsider/,
neither physically nor social-psychologically. Tragic how one sort of
gifted, analytical intellectual, is largely unable to fathom another
sort of gifted---artistic lyrical spiritual.

In general, academe lacks first-hand experience of what outsiders, the
disadvantaged have of the real world. This dearth of experience is not
made up by imagining the dehumanising and ultimately /desensitising/
waves coming at, say, the Brontës, the rumour of human exploitation,
the colonialism and capitalist industrialism. Though academe is master
of paradigms and movements, making the backdrop of Enlightenment's
cold, relentless dynamism and reductionist determinism hardly
oppressive, especially some two hundred years in the past. In short

#+begin_quote
It takes a poet to know a poet, and it takes a special,
time-travelling poet to know these special Romantic Era poets.
#+end_quote

Am I, your guide, a poet? Here's something I wrote

#+begin_verse
And from bygone generations I have surely more than blood.
The loom, the wrapped bolt a shared past, holds me taunt.
And try though I may, little hope there is finding out,
Capturing this force of past souls and blood.
For no sooner is some design of
Art, music, words offered than opens
A far greater twilit space echoing the past.
Alas, that these modern conceits must all fail us;
For the Muses range far above, behind, and beyond--- 
From the heart out to the eternal sea, sky, land,
And everywhere and forever between,
Subtle to mystical to rapturous.

Woe, the tarried songbird whose weakening wings
In late November portend death’s evening hour,
Life’s requisite warmth finally dissipated,
Her once vast blue space closing dark,
The mysterious frontiers setting up,
The shadowy boundary closing...

That we humans may touch,
Stroke the dark velvet curtains
Long before we slip the concealed gaps.
Death would have all such anticipation quiet---
All suppositions. vain assurances flashing then quit,
All expectations rattling, echoing lastly towards stillness
Leaving friends to carry on in dutiful remembrance,
That those, at graveside, must as best they can
Face the darkness and resolutely reach out
Beyond the day’s anguish and sadness
To God and the bless'd everlasting.
#+end_verse

I think this might have got me an honourable mention back in the day.

And yet there's was no political polemic intended; rather, by trying
to re-humanise, /re-sensitise/, à la Novalis' poetising, theirs was a
more Zen approach, a /Euro-Zen/ perhaps. And so I re-collect Feeling,
Nature, and Euro Zen re-sensitisation. But then Romanticism is not
formulaic prescriptive. It is not a political or religious movement,
not a lifestyle ... what then?[fn:97] 

*** Zen: East and West

As a teen growing up in the early 1970s, I, like everyone around me,
fell in love with the magical, mysterious TV series /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_(1972_TV_series)][Kung Fu]]/
(premiere 1972). For a kid in Tennessee it was a pop introduction to
Eastern religion and philosophy. The main character Kwai Chang Caine
was a Chinese-American orphan raised in a Chinese Shaolin Buddhist
monastery in the mid-1800s who as a young man escaped China to America
after killing an aristocrat. Caine was taught the Kung Fu martial arts
style, but also the whole Buddhist pacifist, non-resistant approach to
life, both of which he uses, episode after episode, as he roams about
the wild west as an aesthete itinerant.

I recall getting a book on Zen Buddhism at that time wherein I found
the concept of /Unsui/, which is Japanese and means /cloud,
water/. The term refers to a novice monk

#+begin_quote
In Japan, one receives unsui ordination at the beginning of formal
ordained practice, and this is often perceived as 'novice ordination.'
#+end_quote

My dense, written-for-adults book further described unsui
metaphorically, saying water may change states if impeded: as steam it
escapes heat; as water it goes around impediments or, if dammed,
simply waits patiently; if frozen, likewise, waits---for nothing can
stop its eventual movement to the sea.

The /Kung Fu/ story begins with Caine as a young man killing a
nobleman who has senselessly killed his temple master. Which of course
is the antithesis of the Buddhist way; hence, Caine must leave the
monastery. But this extreme pacifism is arguably a form of nihilism,
or existential meaninglessness, as in, What does it take to get you to
respond, kid? Caine momentarily stepped out of the nihilism and broke
the spell.

Contrast this with something Emily Brontë said in a diary

#+begin_quote
All creation is equally mad. Nature is an inexplicable problem; it
exists on a principle of destruction. Every being must be the tireless
instrument of death to others, or itself must cease to live. Yet
nonetheless we celebrate the day of our birth, and we praise God for
having entered such a world.
#+end_quote

Yes, both Eastern philosophies and my Brontëan English Zen do not
confront the real world with socio-political doctrine or
manifestos. But then where does Buddhism take us? Where does Brontëan
Zen take us?

Buddhism wants enlightenment---which supposedly raises us to some sort
of extra-human demi-angel. Once enlightened, we no longer have worldly
cares. But how many actually reach this state which we might guess is
some permanent version of Dostoyevski's presence of eternal harmony?
This is why I cannot take any sort of Eastern religion based on
enlightenment seriously, since such a very limited number of people
ever arrive at this self-actualization.

But then what of West Zen? Emily Brontë's /All creation is equally
mad.../ presents a deep paradox and falls into fatalism, rather than
offering a path to anything higher. How could poetised
feelings---Longfellow's piteous ruing of snowflakes, Poe's overnights
at the sepulchre by the sea, Novalis' shout-outs to the night---sit
atop all the violent dynamism, all the smashing, banging, clanging of
theirs or our times? How was so-called Romanticism even to be
considered the aesthetics of, the contemporary cultural offerings to
such great upheaval, coercion, destruction as came upon the
nineteenth-century West? The initial answer is no, it could not
be. There could be no artistic, aesthetic compliment to colonialism,
Newtonian science, and industrialism. And therein lies so much of the
irony and paradox. How could The British Empire rising to the height
of its power and reach make William "Dances With Daffodils" Wordsworth
its poet laureate?[fn:98] No, what the Romantic Era poets and artists
created was, as we might categorise (sic) it, a very /underground/
aesthetic, an anti-movement that blanched and faded in the light of
day. The /radical philosophers/, as the proto-Marxist activists were called
by some, were about power and wealth, i.e., the haves versus the
have-nots. Marxist dialectics then said when the gradient is too great
necessarily the revolution will begin. Grim was the new industrial
urban, the largely subsistence peasants now wage slaves living in
existential terror of squalor, hunger, and exploitation. /Homo homini
lupus/[fn:99] had once again raised its terrible head in a new and
awful way.

Here we might suggest classicism as a better choice for Western
civilization. Classicism would seem to better compliment imperialism,
as in "See the wonderful omelette? Now forget all the eggs we broke to
make it." Glory, majesty, splendor, regality, grandeur to justify,
substantiate whatever terrible happenings on the frontiers enabled
it. Or perhaps the classicist envelope around religion, elevating the
huge paradox of meek, pious, pacifist Christianity as a
stop-at-nothing empire's real humanistic intention. As phenomena go,
Romanticism was not to be had, full stop.

The Brontë sisters languished (or blossomed?) in obscurity most of
their lives,[fn:100] but as they gained popular recognition in the
latter half of the eighteenth century, they and other Victorian
Neo-Romanticisms kept on portraying a softer, kinder England from the
capitalist industrialist, imperialist militarist reality. Consider the
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (founded in 1848). Below is a later
painting of John Everett Millais, /An Idyll of 1745/

#+begin_export html
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Everett_Millais#/media/File:An_Idyll_of_1745_(Millais).jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./images/Millais AnIdyllof1745.jpg" width="780" alt="Millais Idyll"></a>
<span class="cap">Before YouTube and hysterical helicopter parents...</span>
#+end_export

Millais is dealing in profane or vulgar nostalgia,[fn:101] an
associativity we today cannot totally follow without flawed
speculation. Of course Britain in 1745 was powerful after favourable
political events (e.g., Treaty of Utrecht) and Robert Walpole's era as
the first prime minister. It might be said that a new era of decadence
had arrived, and yet 1745 was the year of the main Jacobite rebellion;
hence, the patriotic theme. But this was not dominant domineering
Britain yet, rather, a Britain still fighting and scrapping for its
position in the world, mainly against the French, as well as still
suffering the collective PTSD of the bloody seventeenth-century
British civil wars less than a hundred years earlier. And yet Millais
painting this in 1884 would hearkened back, however vulgarly, to, yes,
an /idyllic/ time---at least as he thought provided by the seemingly
eternal English countryside, Britain's first and foremost national
treasure. Three innocent, tabula rasa peasant girls are enraptured by
an enlisted man playing a flute while a fatherly high-born officer
looks on admiringly. Clearly, this pastoral bliss is a version of
Britain longed for by the nostalgia-heavy, Romanticism-influenced
Pre-Raphaelites. Great rueing and regretting permeated Victorian
parlour society, spurring them to revive the earlier Romantic Era and
to see in nature vitality and salvation. See beside as well Millais'
/The Blind Girl/.[fn:102] This was the England they wanted, and not the
bloody savagery of colonialism imperialism, nor the horrific suffering
of the urban industrial wastelands Charles Dickens came to chronicle.

No
more that Christianity before it could.

Romanticism portrayed as a furtherance of Enlightenment freedom of
expression is also farcical. See how eighteenth-century gothic doom
paralleled the beginning of the Industrial Revolution's inflexion
point, as well as the reverberations of colonialism, e.g.,
slavery. Doom, where sins' ever compounded interest smashed any
profits, gains. Dynasties subject to Old Testament's crashing woe.




*** Desensitisation, re-sensitisation

 perception hang-ups, much less emotion
brake-checking. There was no pause to reflect on

#+begin_quote
The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof,
but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every
one that is born of the Spirit. \\

things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to

Humanity born of Spirit forever feeling wind in our faces and circling
around wisdom ... almost as if there is a sanctity in what may emerge
from consciousness beyond behaviorist stimulus-response,
action-reaction, the Day's to-dos: order, change, progress.

Perhaps my Romantic Era principals sensed the hyper-individualistic
reptilian mindset from the middle-class capitalist
industrialists[fn:103] as a egregious desensitisation regime spreading
throughout society, and threw a re-sensitisation at it.



Marxism dispenses with aesthetics, while my principals could not do
without an aesthetical foundation---and then only adorned said
foundation with poetisings. And of course there was no "call to action."


There is something instinctual in my eschewing of Eastern as a Dark Muser. Why
do I cleave to Emily Brontë's English Zen and revolt against all the
westernised Buddhism?[fn:104]


No, my principle principals

Here I will simply and plainly state that I believe Emily Jane Brontë
was the very centre, the utter culmination of the whole Romanticism
thing---ironically _the most outside_ of any Romanticism boxing or
packaging by academe. She combined in her /poetry/[fn:105]

+ *Pagan Nature*,
+ *Dark*, and
+ *Christianity*

and in keeping with Keats' /Negative Capability/ she did not let any
one or two overshadow the other two or one. *Like a frontier one-room
school teacher, she forced the rowdy peasant boys Pagan Nature, Dark,
and Christianity sit close enough on the school bench to smell each
other.* Her nature awareness mentioned above would be enough, but my
Haworth Emily brings something even deeper to the table. She forced
nature paganism and Christianity to sit close to each other on the
rock on the moors, on the bench in the church, close enough to smell
each other. Here I'll repeat what I consider to be her other two
points, namely, the Dark and Christianity in these three poems

+ /The night is darkening round me/ (once more),
+ /I'll come when thou art saddest/ and
+ /I would have touched the heavenly key/

which appear clumped together as poem /31./ in /Emily Brontë The Complete
Poems/ from Penguin Classics

#+begin_verse
The night is darkening round me,
The wild winds coldly blow;
But a tyrant spell has bound me
And I cannot, cannot go.

The giant trees are bending
Their bare boughs weighed with snow,
And the storm is fast descending,
And yet I cannot go.

Clouds beyond clouds above me,
Wastes beyond wastes below;
But nothing drear can move me—
I will not, cannot go.

---

I'll come when thou art saddest,
Laid alone in the darkened room;
When the mad day's mirth has vanished,
And the smile of joy is banished
From evening's chilly gloom.

I'll come when the heart's real feeling
Has entire unbiased sway,
And my influence o'er thee stealing,
Grief deepening joy congealing,
Shall bear thy soul away.

Listen 'tis just the hour,
The awful time for thee;
Dost thou not feel upon thy soul
A flood of strange sensations roll,
Forerunners of a sterner power,
Heralds of me?

---

I would have touched the heavenly key
That spoke alike of bliss and thee;
I would have woke the evening song,
But its words died upon my tongue.
But then I knew that he stood free,
Would never speak of joy again,
And then I felt ...

*** Virginia Woolf's unfortunate critique of /Jane Eyre/

Every era seems to latch onto some set of hyper-idealisms, our present
times the herculean task of idealising any sort of non-heterosexual,
transgender proclivities to the level of enlightenment, the bearers'
paths through life that of martyrs, geniuses, prophets, and saints. A
double hero for both gender-bending and modern realism literature is
Virginia Woolf (1882 - 1941).[fn:106] In the photo to the right I ask,
do we see a long-suffering, compassionate person, or is this a cold,
haughty, insufferable urbanite exuding modern emotional detachment and
unavailability? In any event, she was a late-Victorian,
early-Edwardian intellectual and writer, a founding member of the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group][Bloomsbury Group]] of like-minded intellectuals and artists. And it was
in 1916 in her collected essays called /The Common Reader/ that she
critiqued /Jane Eyre/, as well as /Wuthering Heights/ and their two
authors Charlotte and Emily Brontë. And in so doing she could not have
aligned herself more strongly with the "don't get it" crowd. For
example, she describes Charlotte in a singularly patronising and
condescending way

#+begin_quote
When we think of her [Charlotte Brontë] we have to imagine some one
who had no lot in our modern world; we have to cast our minds back to
the ’fifties of the last century, to a remote parsonage upon the wild
Yorkshire moors. In that parsonage, and on those moors, unhappy and
lonely, in her poverty and her exaltation, she remains for ever.
#+end_quote

No "lot" in the modern world, indeed. This /qualifies/ not
disqualifies Charlotte to tell me a story. It is having no "lot" in a
natural, organic world from which Woolf suffered. Then

#+begin_quote
She [Charlotte Brontë] does not attempt to solve the problems of human
life; she is even unaware that such problems exist; all her force, and
it is the more tremendous for being constricted, goes into the
assertion, "I love," "I hate," "I suffer."
#+end_quote

And what problems of human life have ever been solved by anyone living
in a modern city? Your city, Ms Woolf, /is the problem/ and any
solving of anything in a city is the momentary calming of a tempest in
a teapot. Here she gets to it

#+begin_quote
In other words, we read Charlotte Brontë not for exquisite observation
of character---her characters are vigorous and elementary; not for
comedy---hers is grim and crude; not for a philosophic view of
life---hers is that of a country parson's daughter; but for her
poetry. Probably that is so with all writers who have, as she has, an
overpowering personality, so that, as we say in real life, they have
only to open the door to make themselves felt. There is in them some
untamed ferocity perpetually at war with the accepted order of things
which makes them desire to create instantly rather than to observe
patiently. This very ardour, rejecting half shades and other minor
impediments, wings its way past the daily conduct of ordinary people
and allies itself with their more inarticulate passions. It makes them
poets, or, if they choose to write in prose, intolerant of its
restrictions. Hence it is that both Emily and Charlotte are always
invoking the help of nature. They both feel the need of some more
powerful symbol of the vast and slumbering passions in human nature
than words or actions can convey. It is with a description of a storm
that Charlotte ends her finest novel Villette. "The skies hang full
and dark---a wrack sails from the west; the clouds cast themselves
into strange forms." So she calls in nature to describe a state of
mind which could not otherwise be expressed. But neither of the
sisters observed nature accurately as Dorothy Wordsworth observed it,
or painted it minutely as Tennyson painted it. They seized those
aspects of the earth which were most akin to what they themselves felt
or imputed to their characters, and so their storms, their moors,
their lovely spaces of summer weather are not ornaments applied to
decorate a dull page or display the writer's powers of
observation—they carry on the emotion and light up the meaning of the
book.
#+end_quote

Woolf and her Bloomsbury friends were certainly anti-Romanticism---as
were all the cool kids by that time; but in this passage her
ignorance, intolerance, and general cluelessness truly flashes
brightly. First, saying Charlotte's prose is poetic is not a failing
as she seems to mean, rather, a great achievement. Then to say
Charlotte has an overpowering personality leading her to impatiently
throw out half-baked observations is ludicrous. /Jane Eyre/ is all
about the main protagonist weaving in and out of the "accepted order
of things," carving out a place for herself against great
impediments. But then the centrepiece of Woolf madness, namely, the
accusation that Charlotte and Emily are always "invoking the help of
nature." Aaaagh! Virginia, dear, /that's a feature not a bug!/

Woolf is critical of Brontëan use of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy][pathetic fallacy]],[fn:107] a
staple of Romantic Era writing. But of course writers of Woolf's era
were through with the link between Nature and man. They were onto more
realistic depictions of life. And yet all I see from them and their
ilk is existential meaninglessness, hopelessness, absurdism.

No, indeed, Woolf can't abide the Brontëan use of Nature. Charlotte
has apparently blundered by "call[ing] in nature to describe a state
of mind which could not otherwise be expressed." What other vehicle of
expression should there be? Woolf makes her most clueless criticism by
saying storms, moors, lovely spaces of summer weather should only be
"ornaments applied to decorate a dull page or display the writer’s
powers of observation," and using Nature to "carry on the emotion and
light up the meaning of the book" is bad writing. She claims William
Wordsworth sister Dorothy was a more accurate observer of
nature. Really? Dorothy Wordsworth was through-and-through a
nature-based Romanticist, although mainly unpublished, a poet in
lockstep with her brother. Fazit: The more shade, the more attempts at
discredit Woolf flung at the Brontës, the more obvious who the wiser
was.

Allow me something I found just by opening /Emily Brontë The Complete
Poems/ to a random page

#+begin_verse
O evening, why is thy light so sad?
Why is the sun's last ray so cold?
Hush! our smile is as ever glad,
But my heart is growing old.

It's over now; I've known it all;
I'll hide it in my heart no more,
But back again that night recall,
And think the fearful vision o'er.

The evening sun in cloudless shine
Has passed from summer's heaven divine,
And dark the shades of twilight grew,
And stars were in the depth of blue

And in the heath or mountain far
From human eye and human care,
With thoughtful thought and tearful eye,
I sadly watched that solemn sky.
#+end_verse

The narrator's emotions float upon, are embedded in Nature. A real
human being has exactly this sort of experience: Life and Nature are
interwoven. Simply put, the Brontës were beholden unto Nature and
God. They beseeched Nature and God,[fn:108] and thus came back with
blessings in the form of lines such as these. And so I cannot allow
Woolf, nor any other city-bound modernist clone-bunnies, to cancel my
ladies' artistic licenses. Modern realists like Woolf are
self-condemned to a mental and emotional poverty for refusing the
miraculousness---however sublime or terrible---of Nature and our
fantastic membership thereof. Ironic how urban realists are nearly all
"reformists" out to radical socialists, always wanting to improve
mankind's lot, many following deterministic Marxist dialectic
scripts.[fn:109] And yet they cannot see how /no one knows what to do
with the Industrial Era!/, nor how the human is supposed to ever
thrive in these alien, hostile, sterile urban hell zones---however
decorated this or that corner may be with classical tinsel.[fn:110]

Academe's take on Romanticism---a very big elephant in the middle of
the room, indeed. What to do with this beast wont to co-opt and usurp
my genial, gifted principals, and, in general, completely miss my Dark
Muse? To be sure, academe /completely/ misses the Dark Muse,
incessantly pigeon-holing it as gothic fright---or just missing it
entirely. Again, one of the main tasks of WutheringUK is to get Dark
out of its academe and popular media prisons. Foremost is how academe
Romanticism seems more the labeling work of these clueless busy-bodies
than any intentional movement from the actual creators.[fn:111] Which
begs the question posed by the highly-respected twentieth-century
humanities professor Isaiah Berlin in his lecture series on
Romanticism whether those times were not something timeless, a
permanent state of mind wholly outside of anyone's historical fence
work.[fn:112] Nevertheless, there is no avoiding the sweeping
intellectualisations, the mountains of churn from Romanticism's
academic investigators. And as I say, /none/ of them get Dark; and in
general, the more they think they know, the less they actually
do. Thus, the cleft between what Romanticism scholars say we are
reading and what you or I might simply feel upon reading can be
huge. And again, that is my whole point here.

Too often scholars are all over the map with pontifications and
theories. For example, Andrea Wulf in her /Magnificent Rebels/ depicts
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as a sort of adult-supervision den dad of
Jena Set, and yet here is something he actually said about
Romanticism

#+begin_quote
Klassisch ist das Gesunde, romantisch das Kranke ... or
... Romanticism is disease. It is the weak, the sickly, the battle cry
of a school of wild poets and Catholic reactionaries; whereas
classicism is strong, fresh, gay, sound, like Homer and the
/Nibelungenlied/.
#+end_quote

I won't accuse Wulf of poor research or intentional
obfuscation. Having been a founder of /Sturm und Drang/, perhaps we
should grant Goethe the right to have been of two minds. Perhaps he
was initially attracted to the Jena buzz, all the /haute pensée/
sprung up in his backyard, but then soured on its content,
implications, the personalities behind it. Certainly Schiller
did. Still, this is a prime example of how diverse, even contradictory
Romantic Era scholarship can be.

Yes, many contemporaries of the actual artistic producers helped talk
Romanticism into existence---the Jena Set, Coleridge, Germaine de
Staël, Emerson et al.---but again, I believe the actual principals
were far-sighted, inward-gazing, quasi-timeless unicorns not following
guidelines or living up to anybody's expectations.[fn:113] ... and most
certainly they did not "write to spec" or pastiche, as was fairly
obviously the case with gothic horror novelists. /And so I say sifting
through all the academic chaff gets us nowhere versus simply reading
and silently contemplating the product itself./ All for naught is
listing facts and figures, creating categories and pigeonholes,
imagining commonalities, generalities, throwing a formulaic hyperspace
over the lone wolf creators. Caveat emptor. If the purpose of a poem,
as Keats said, is to embolden the soul to accept mystery, then such
analytical death marches must be seen as antithetical. Analysing
mystery is a fool's errand.[fn:114] For me at least, the principals
/re-sensitised/, while their describers have only managed to
/de-sensitise/ with their mystery-deaf approach.

Some insight comes from two men of this era who unfortunately wore
both hats, i.e., creator and explainer, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and
Edgar Allan Poe. With them we see their creations take us into the
ephemeral mists of Romanticism's subtleties and sublimities, while
their intellectualizations and pontifications thereof sound windy, if
not shrill out to ridiculous. No wonder the concept of left-brain,
right-brain arose,[fn:115] as nothing else can describe this
split-personality confusion. But the urban salons necessarily
trafficked in rational, left-brain talk and copy. And this is for me
the /crisis of Romanticism/, i.e., the huge divide between the
creators and their content versus the describers and promoters. Yes Mr
Keats, we shall luxuriate long in the water, but then slowly, gently
swim back to the shore to gracefully and silently rise out of the
water and stand exulted for the whole experience. Of course we cannot
luxuriate in the lake forever, but upon exiting we must somehow hold
the experience in awe and reverence and not grasp for logical
explanations, which can only turn it into a show, a farce, even so, a
sham, a carcass.

*** English and German Romanticism

Today a hit song or a brain-dead TikTok video can go globally "viral"
in less than a day, with imitations instantly springing up like
mushrooms after rain. But in the closing years of the eighteenth
century there just seemed to be something in the air, which came to be
called Romanticism, apparently first by Jena Set founder Friedrich
Schlegel[fn:116] ... after Coleridge and Wordsworth's collaboration
/Lyrical Ballads/ (first edition) appeared in 1798 and Novalis' /HttN/
in 1800. But again, my principle principal, Emily Brontë, who wrote
decades later, arguably knew very little to absolutely nothing about
Jena, Novalis, or even much of Coleridge and Wordsworth other than
perhaps a reading of their /Lyrical Ballads/. Even later, Poe had
supposedly encountered translations of Ludwig Tieck's short
stories. Otherwise, there had not been much cross-fertilisation,
rather, the Romanticism Muse was, yes, just something in the air.

/Early German Romanticism/[fn:117] began when Novalis' /HttN/ burst
upon the scene in the very first year of the nineteenth century. Clear
to me, however, is that /HttN/ was a one-off that came out of the
blue, thus, certainly not intentional, positioned for, or tailored to
any specific trend or agenda. Contrast this with Goethe's play
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Tauris_(Goethe)][Iphigenia in Tauris]]/ (versions in 1779, 1781, 1786), based on
Euripides' original, which was specifically meant to showcase Goethe's
ideal of a modern classicism, i.e., his and Friedrich Schiller's
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Classicism][Weimar Classicism]]. But the /Jena Set/, centred around the Schlegel
brothers, August Wilhelm and Friedrich, along with August's wife
Caroline, seized upon the mostly absentee Novalis as their boy wonder
/Liebling/ mascot---and the conflation of producer and describers
began in earnest. But just one year after /HttN/ appeared, Novalis
died on them. Though the seed sprouted and the Jena Set went on to
create an entire mountain range of Jena Romanticism which had little
to do with their boy-man hero Novalis. After philosopher [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte][Johann
Gottlieb Fichte]] fell out of favour, the young, dynamic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling][Friedrich
Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]] came on board, and it is his /nature
philosophy/ which became Jena Romanticism's house brand, eventually
adopted and promoted by Coleridge (sometimes as literal translation as
in his [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographia_Literaria][Biographia Literaria]] - 1817), then by Emerson and the
Transcendentalists in the Colonies. Again, all of this churn misses
Dark entirely.

*** Poe and Dark Romanticism

And then /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Romanticism][Dark Romanticism]]/ (DR) ... another academe box. At its
centre was supposedly [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe][Edgar Allan Poe]].[fn:118] Alas but the Wikipedia
description of DR trots out all the negative stereotypes of Dark. As
one biographer noted, Poe struggled all his short adult life to make a
living as a writer and poet. One supposed quote of his said

#+begin_quote
Your writer of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big
pen, with a very blunt nib.
#+end_quote

My take on Poe was that, as I said above, he led a Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde
literary existence. The American publishing world was rarely
supportive, as one historian said, eager to move on from Dark and
gothic. And yet Poe always seemed to find audiences.

Poe's best known poem was /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven][The Raven]]/, which wound through the
publishing world---mainly periodicals and newspapers---throughout
1845, finally landing in a collection of Poe's poems in the summer
of 1845. Back in the day, school children would learn by heart at
least the first stanza

#+begin_verse
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore---
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door---
            Only this and nothing more.”
#+end_verse

and if you were a good student, perhaps even the second stanza

#+begin_verse
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
            Nameless here for evermore.
#+end_verse

then of course /...’Tis the wind and nothing more.../ and other such
snatches. And for youth poetry reciting contests /The Raven/ has been
a standard. But through all this we have what is basically a throwback
to the doom-and-gloom Graveyard School gothic, i.e., not informed by
Barbauld's finer sort of Dark. Then came the next year Poe's fateful
essay entitled /The Philosophy of Composition/ wherein he attempted to
reverse-engineer what he did to come up with /The Raven/. Here's a
portion

#+begin_quote
I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of
ill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word "Nevermore" at the
conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length
about one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object-
supremeness or perfection at all points, I asked myself, "Of all
melancholy topics what, according to the universal understanding of
mankind, is the most melancholy?"  Death, was the obvious reply. "And
when," I said, "is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?" From
what I have already explained at some length the answer here also is
obvious, "When it most closely allies itself to Beauty: The death then
of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the
world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for
such topic are those of a bereaved lover."
#+end_quote

Alas, but I just cannot accept that he created /The Raven/ on some
poetry conveyor belt, speaking of Death capitalised, then death of a
woman almost as if a gimmick. Again, alas. It gets worse

#+begin_quote
Most writers---poets in especial---prefer having it understood that
they compose by a species of fine frenzy---an ecstatic intuition---and
would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the
scenes, at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought, at the
true purposes seized only at the last moment, at the innumerable
glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view, at the
fully-matured fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable, at the
cautious selections and rejections, at the painful erasures and
interpolations---in a word, at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for
scene-shifting, the step-ladders, and demon-traps, the cock's
feathers, the red paint and the black patches, which, in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, constitute the properties of the literary
histrio [actor, player].
#+end_quote

Cringe. He sounds ashamed about falling into a state of "ecstatic
intuition," as if he has peers around whom he had better not sound too
airy-floaty. Or maybe he wanted to say, "'Twas nothing. Just follow my
formula, and you too can write a nice, dark poem that'll have them all
weeping." Once more, cringe, alas.

Personally, I do believe /The Raven/ came from something
ecstatic---out to trance and vision. Again, Poe was simply an erratic
character who seemed to change personalities often. But sometimes I
want /The Raven/ to be about the death of Romanticism. If academe says
the right bookend was circa 1850, then perhaps I could read lamenting
of the passing of an era symbolised by a beautiful, virtuous woman
Leanore into the lines. Allow me, please.

And so here I want to make a very important point about my principals,
to be sure, *that they were only vessels*, those particular mortals
the Muses chose to be their emissaries. This angle is well developed
in the Hollywood film /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)][Amadeus]]/ where Mozart[fn:119] was depicted as an
immature, outta-control brat and yet the conduit of heavenly music. As
alluded above, Novalis was likely just such a boy-wonder Amadeus sort,
Poe no doubt lashing out mercurial, Emily Brontë austere anorexic,
Emily Dickinson a spinster recluse. Looking too closely into their
personal stories typically gets us no closer to discovering the
origins of their inspiration---another academe dead end. Like the
writer and artist Kahil Gibran said about children in his /The
Prophet/, they come /through/ you, they are not /of/ you.

Personally, I believe Poe's own description of his "place of creative
origin" describes it best. He once mentioned the state of having
"thoughts behind thoughts." Which is something I found described in a
[[https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/neuregulin-1-genie-und-schizophrenie-moeglicherweise-folge-eines-gens-a-870089.html][/Der Spiegel/ article]] from 2012 about the link between creativity and
*schizophrenia*. Basically, an "expression" of the gene Neuregulin 1
(NRG1), which supposedly is key in regulating "synaptic plasticity" is
sometimes amiss, but not so amiss that full-on schizophrenia
results. Instead of full debilitation with phantom voices and raging
paranoia, a "schizoid lite" sufferer will have the hidden underground
river of wild disassociated thoughts, but be able to control it. Once
I read this Der Spiegel article scales fell from my eyes---it
described me! Here is an example of a poem I wrote

#+begin_verse
Dark burgundy roses, cobalt irises
Delivered for the night's performance,
To the theatre in the hollow, */le théâtre de la combe/*.
City-bound now, the hollow once a fairy circle,
Long since fairy dream haunted.
Look down from the sacred grove, now the square.
Recall the one attendance as a child:
Visions of darker, older nights since. 

Escape to the countryside;
Great sunlight to dispel dark fairy rumour.
Yet the pale blue sky but tissue, the thinnest canopy.
Indigo lace swirling, grey clouds, fog billowing.
Incessant winds to lift and shred the canopy
Till starless void revealed...

... darkness, and the chill wind rises up
The cobblestone /ruelle/ from the hollow.
On this night of many nights as one,
Dark purple clouds stripe a moon large and orange,
Placed just above /le théâtre de la combe/.
#+end_verse

As far as describing my creative process I remember becoming fixated
upon a nighttime scene of a narrow, winding, cobblestone,
other-century street and a small theatre therein. And the rest simply
came from the underground river of /thought rumour/ below my direct
consciousness. Further, I might add a section of my novel /Emily of
Wolkeld/. Here is Emily describing her special place

#+begin_quote
She gazed once more at the broken outline of Wolkeld Hall through the
trees, letting her concentration slip and her eyes glaze. She
listened after that strange place in her mind from which bits
and pieces of scenes played beyond her comprehension, where
shadows of thoughts never quite became clear. Though at times
something would suddenly stand before her and demand her best
attempt at a poetisation.

Since Kansas, since puberty, she would occasionally find herself
slipping into some further space beyond the secret compartments. But
again, she could only sense, partially comprehend this expansive,
twilit region, fleeting, but long dominating her heart and mind. At
first she considered such flights just intense day-dreaming, but over
time they became less imagined, more a definite communion with a
distinctly separate realm. It was a dusky world, steeped in sublime
melancholic loneliness, often large and panoramic. At first she found
it worrisome---not some clear religious transport of light and
ecstasy. And yet she came to believe good was speaking, not evil, nor
for that matter any sort of lurking mental illness. She wished it to
be something of her soul’s true home, perhaps some distant view of
Cumbria—at least that was the place to which she always mapped it, for
which she yearned immediately thereafter.
#+end_quote

The queen of this sort of /Schizophrenia Lite™/ is of course Emily
Dickinson, whose lines often disappear into this underground
region. Reading her hundreds of little one-, two-, three-stanza bursts
leaves me certain she was prototypically Schizo-lite™

#+begin_verse
A thought went up my mind to-day
That I have had before,
But did not finish, --- some way back,
I could not fix the year,

Nor where it went, nor why it came
The second time to me,
Nor definitely what it was,
Have I the art to say.

But somewhere in my soul, I know
I've met the thing before;
It just reminded me --- 't was all ---
And came my way no more.
#+end_verse

Bright gems, one after the other, poured out of that terribly gentle,
unimaginably deep woman.

Now, on to what I consider Poe's best poem, namely, /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabel_Lee][Annabel Lee]]/

#+begin_verse
It was many and many a year ago,
   In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
   By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
   Than to love and be loved by me.

I was a child and she was a child,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
But we loved with a love that was more than love---
   I and my Annabel Lee---
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven
   Coveted her and me.

And this was the reason that, long ago,
   In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
   My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her highborn kinsmen came
   And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
   In this kingdom by the sea.

The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,
   Went envying her and me—
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,
   In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
   Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

But our love it was stronger by far than the love
   Of those who were older than we---
   Of many far wiser than we---
And neither the angels in Heaven above
   Nor the demons down under the sea
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;

For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
   Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
   Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,
   In her sepulchre there by the sea---
   In her tomb by the sounding sea.

If there is a better American example of the Dark Muse, I don't know
it. Here Poe is sustainable contemplative melancholic, rather than
hurling his fright bombs as in his prose. Did Poe know of Novalis and
his supposed hundred nights of graveside vigilance for deceased Sophie
von Kühn?[fn:120] Perhaps but totally irrelevant. Again, I suss out
that both Poe and Emily Brontë got the Dark Muse and gave it with
their poetry, but not in their prose, falling back into gothic. And so
I fall back to poetry and fragmented bursts as the only vehicle of
true Dark.

** All travesties aside...

What if we all went around completely misrepresenting each other,
telling outlandishly false things about whomever whenever? Enmity,
feuding, fisticuffs, the breakdown of society, perhaps even civil war
would ensue---at the very least lawyers would get rich from all the
libel and slander lawsuits. But what if the people about whom we are
spewing pure calumny, making up whole-cloth fabrications are the long
since dead? In today's Hollywood this very fate has recently befallen
my Bach and Mozart of poetry, Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson. The
past is a witness that never speaks but never blinks. The guilty, the
sick of our era sense this and attack it, slander and distort it.

If Virginia Woolf was wrong out to downright silly, she was just a
beginner at literary defamation. The travesties I mean are the
modernist triumphalist revisionist, intentionally anachronistic
misrepresentations of my two main principals, i.e., the two Emilies,
Brontë and Dickinson, specifically in the form of the AppleTV+ series
/Dickinson/ (2019) and the Hollywood film /Emily/ (2022). It is partly
the need to correct these serious crimes against culture and history
that I have initiated this whole WutheringUK effort.

Both /Dickinson/ and /Emily/ are completely cringe unwatchable, but
worse by far is the all but demonic inhabitation of Emily Dickinson
unfolding in the three-season, thirty episode AppleTV+ series
/Dickinson/. Apparently, the real Amherst Emily said something
affectionate in a letter to a female friend---which opened the door
for screenwriter Alena Smith to flip typical nineteenth-century
platonic[fn:121] to sexual and reinvent the shy, gentle, reclusive, homebody,
proto-nerd-girl Emily Elizabeth as a brassy, bratty, boorish, snarky,
completely desensitised and masculinised, outta-control, hyper-sexual
protest-lesbian champion against the patriarchy. And so this period
porn, this cultural hooliganism went on for three years, spread over
thirty episodes of crashing, crypto-rebel poser effrontery, even
winning a Peabody, among other, "awards." As the wincing Wikipedia
article, which categorises it as a "comic-drama," (sic) says

#+begin_quote
/Dickinson/ is notable for its use of anachronisms, incorporating
modern language, music, and references into its portrayal of
historical events and figures.
#+end_quote

...quite possibly the understatement of all time. It also states
/Dickinson/ is "a window into the cultural and political climate of
the time."  Really? Quite a dirty, distorting window. It is nothing of
the sort, rather, an entire reinvention based on radical, male-hating,
misanthropic, twenty-first-century agitprop feminism, full stop. If
conspiracy theories about "cultural Marxism" were ever to be taken
serious, this would be Exhibit A.[fn:122] This is nothing less than a
frontal assault on an icon of Western culture, and I don't like it.

<span class="cap">Ah, nice wallpaper?</span>
#+end_export

More innocuous perhaps because it is a single film lasting only two
hours, thus, not able to get up to as much evil and inanity as
/Dickinson/, is the 2022 Hollywood /Emily/,[fn:123] depicting Emily
Brontë, the woman I consider the greatest, deepest English-language
poet, as a clumsy, oafish maladroit, stumbling around in a completely
anachronistic period fantasy chaos. Enough said.

I hemmed and hawed over this bit of electron savagery, but seriously,
there can be /zero/ buy-in to this sort of nonsense if we are to get
anywhere near understanding the true nature of these special
people. To get, to grok my principals we must suspend any and all
revisionist wishful thinking. We can't just have actors donning
excellent period costumes---only to carry on like today's vapid urban
hipsters. We have to accept, work with the world they inhabited, warts
and all. /They're not our pets./ And even if we could go back in time
and meet our chosen unicorns, we would probably not become their
friends. In my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ my modern Emily is playing the
tourist in today's tourist-trap Haworth and imagines an encounter with
classic Emily

#+begin_verse
She wondered anew what Emily Brontë would have thought had she walked by at that moment. Modern Emily would have stared beseechingly at original Emily---and no doubt original Emily would have been duly affronted.

“Miss, are you going out to the falls this day? May I come along? I do not wish to be alone in the countryside,” modern Emily might call after her hero.

And fitting the heaviness of the air, the blankness of the thinly clouded, washed-out blue sky above, classic Emily would flatly reply, “Yes, I am going there, but I can suffer no strange company. Good day.”
#+end_verse

Right. I can imagine Haworth Emily of yore as being quite curt,
abrupt, protective of her privacy, in short, anti-social. Again,
making a personality cult out of our heroes from the past, however
sensational as we may now see them, is a big mistake.

Indeed, polemicists are forever appropriating some defenceless figure
from the past to reimagine as their pets. And so any gifted unicorn
from yesteryear who might have chafed even the least bit at society's
eternal(ly shifting, reforming) containment fields is reintroduced
reconstituted as some modern hack's proto-revolutionist. For shame.
Ghost rustling, I call this.

Contrast with the 2011 /Jane Eyre/ where the modernist triumphalist
nonsense is kept to a minimum. In this umpteenth filming of the
Charlotte Brontë classic, there are two actual prayer scenes! I urge
everyone to watch this gem. Likewise, the Jane Champion /Bright Star/
mentioned above. Still, these are modern screen verisimilitude, which
cannot and does not capture much other than a sweet vibe.

Of course the audio-visual medium of film is fraught. First and
foremost, we must accept the social-political landscape of those
times. Christianity for one simply was a given in both of their
lives. It was their metaphysical foundation and was largely accepted
by both Emilies, indeed, often poetised.

Today we shamble about in a political fog where the Left will not
believe anything good about the past, and the Right will not brook
anything bad about some golden era in their imaginations. The Left,
however, is arguably everything Noam Chomsky had to say about French
nihilism, and the Right an amalgamation of conservative and, newly,
libertarianism.[fn:124]




** Grand Marais, my sepulchre by the sea?

One of my earliest brushes with Dostoevski's /presence of eternal
harmony/ came on a Halloween night back when I was a little boy in a
small Southern Illinois town. We were trick-or-treating on our street,
the oldest neighbourhood in town with Victorians, cobblestone, and gas
streetlights. At some point it felt as though I had left the present
and entered another dimension---a nighttime fairy forest of bare
trees. Everything was magical, and yet as I was still young enough not
to be completely disabused of magic, I did not think anything was too
out of the ordinary. I distinctly remember looking up into the dense,
bare branches of a huge old oak and seeing the moon looking in and out
of crossing clouds and feeling like I was a spirit entered another
world. I sometimes get that feeling where I now reside.

I live in the far-northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called North
Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, just before the
Canadian border. This so-called "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region][Arrowhead Region]]" holds some three
million-plus acres of wilderness on the shores of the world's largest
body (by surface area) of freshwater. And to my mind, this is a very
Dark Muse kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, I cannot go,
much as my fellow humans distress me with their pointedly anti-Dark
attitudes. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but our Dark vibe
here must be experienced to be really appreciated. And yes, I still
see this other world of shadow and magic whenever I look out at my
moonlit /Inland Sea/ over the treetops of dark spruce and gnarled,
bare aspen.

/Inland Sea/,[fn:125] thus, North Coast instead of North
Shore. Indeed, she is so much more sea-like than any lake. To my
thinking, a lake is something much smaller and much friendlier. Our
Inland Sea is big and often violent like any sea or ocean of
saltwater. She's no simple lake for beer-and-brats picnickers,
windsurfers, speedboat and jet ski riffraff.[fn:126] To be sure, she
has a mighty présence, often dark and moody if not threatening.

Here is nothing really spectacular in the modern sense of the American
Great Outdoors, nothing overwhelms us like we typically think of the
American West and Alaska with one postcard vista after
another. Rather, here is more subtlety, more reserve. Often a deep
moodiness prevails. And as I insist, only subtle can lead to
sublime. But again, the people here a decidedly not Dark Musers, which
creates an almost perfect laboratory to test whether Dark is nature or
nurture. I'm saying if there are no gothic buildings, e.g., no Père
Lachaise Cemetery,[fn:127] no community of mutually re-enforced
nighttime proclivities, then any Dark I'm getting must come from the
actual place itself, i.e., one hundred percent nature over
nurture. Which bolsters my argument that the Dark Muse ultimately
comes from Nature.

But yes, I am quite alone here in my dark-oriented assessments. My
little village, Grand Marais, the county seat, is only some thirteen
hundred souls. And yet as the years go by we are becoming evermore
suburban-like in mentality. Being a popular Northern Midwest resort
town, we have a steady stream of newcomers who increasingly are not
adapting to small-town life; instead, maintaining their aloof,
disengaged, emotionally unavailable, blinkered urban-suburban ways.

Another social-psychology pitfall is how many people came up from a
Chicago or especially Twin Cities suburb ostensibly to reinvent
themselves. They've made the leap out of the sterile, soulless
clone-bunny suburbia to now be some new and improved version of
themselves. They typically riff on Hemingway and Jack London, i.e., a
macho attitude about wilderness and what I call this
/Neo-Klondikism/. This is totally different from the real pioneers of
late nineteenth, early twentieth centuries who most certainly brought
Victorian civilization to the wilderness.

Because the spectacular is mostly blazingly lit, our dearth of

<span class="cap">Northern Lights by artist Liz Sivertson</span>
#+end_export

Here's a few lines I once wrote some twenty years ago after a
late-autumn hike

#+begin_quote
Mists race westward through the surrounding spruce forest. The entire
ridge enveloped in snow clouds, the light failing, the Western
Hemisphere’s greatest inland sea---just four miles south and seven
hundred feet below---totally obscured. Sleet falls fast and hard,
stinging my face; my eyes cannot fully focus; though I hear the wind
through the coated trees, the distant sound of the invisible waves,
crashing angrily against the rocks, always the rocks...

I have come the four miles up from the town, up the wet, slippery
trail, up through the darkening forest, to pay homage to this late
autumn wonderland. The Dark Muse is strong. I, the Modern, wear a
Gore-tex jacket, over a Merino wool top, over a silk base layer. I
wear black lycra tights, padded biking gloves in case of a fall. I
wear special minimalist moccasins made to simulate barefoot running. I
am out to face the age-old elements hiding behind these modern
accoutrements. I considered walking rather than running, but no,
darkness was too near and I had to reach the ridge-top ere dusk. Not a
soul as I climbed the trail. Pausing at the ridge’s two main streams
to witness their loud and clear coursing from all the new
precipitation. It was all but dark when I set off from the
cloud-bound ridge-top for the town again. The snow was accumulating in
earnest, making downhill footing difficult. But as I say, the Muse was
strong, and the growing darkness made it all the stronger.
#+end_quote

That was written before I really had latched onto the Dark Muse. Now
things are much more firmly formed and I'm following a more
intentional path vis-à-vis Dark...

...which began as I tell people back when I was a soldier in Germany
(1975 - 1978) and visited Amsterdam for Christmas 19


*** My Christianity

A few things have led me back to belief in God. Besides the Brontës
and the other poets of the Glorious Nineteenth showing me how wondrous
belief can be when its subtleties are brought out through poetising, I
have a more mundane, topical reason, namely, hallucinogenic drugs. I
mean to say I finally realised that any "mind-altering" chemicals are
a false commandeering of my natural sense of amazement and wonderment,
that a human's innate sense of awe and wonderment must be carefully
maintained and protected, that this highly sought-after presence of
eternal harmony state can never be summoned artificially. I also
realised that simply chasing after POEH moments in general is a bad
practice. Which is why I reject Eastern religions---as I spoke of
above. Again, Buddhism, whether legend-influenced Tibetan or
legend-free Zen, wants us in a permanent POEH, which to my thinking is
an artificial, again, /trans/-humanist state. I repeat, my Haworth
Emily as a lean, hungry, deprived, hard-pressed little bat is my
truth. She who brought nature paganism and the Dark Muse and
anti-woo-woo Protestantism close enough together to smell each other
per Keats' /Negative Capability/.

Christianity as a holding pattern on earth, an intentional backing
away from any sustained POEH state indeed. And I must admit Nature has
time and again told me not to bring any sort of fantasy or stoner
mentality to Her, i.e., expectations (read demands) of heightened,
magical, "cosmic" happenings all for traipsing along a wilderness
trail for a few hours. She has seriously reprimanded me for expecting
some cheap, cliche nonsense like that.

I might call my Christianity a "responsive" Christianity in that I
read, e.g., Christina Rossetti's /Love is strong as death/

#+begin_verse
I have not sought Thee, I have not found Thee,
I have not thirsted for Thee:
And now cold billows of death surround me,
Buffeting billows of death astound me, ---
Wilt Thou look upon, wilt Thou see
Thy perishing me?"

"Yea, I have sought thee, yea, I have found thee,
Yea, I have thirsted for thee,
Yea, long ago with love's bands I bound thee:
Now the Everlasting Arms surround thee, ---
Through death's darkness I look and see
And clasp thee to Me."
#+end_verse

and I feel, I respond. I find Rossetti on the same fatalist wavelength
as Emily Brontë. She is describing an interaction with God not
dissimilar to Haworth Emily's /"I'll come when thou art saddest/
where, again, life is bitterly entropic, i.e., effort is nowhere near
linearly rewarded, plans hardly realised.[fn:128] 

But then organised Christianity is dogma---with results, rewards for
our compliance and obedience thin on the ground other than avoidance
of instant damnation upon death.

** /My background/

** About the name WutheringUK

* Footnotes

[fn:1] /muse/: Originally any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts; /or/ a state of
deep thought or abstraction, e.g., to enter a /muse/ over a poem; /or/
a source of inspiration, e.g., /Jane Austen is my muse/.

[fn:2] ...e.g., Lady Dedlock's death at the graveyard of her secret
lover in Dickens' /Bleak House/.

[fn:3] The word /moor/ appears forty-three times in /Jane Eyre/. After
the second or third use, I was just putty in Charlotte's hands...

[fn:4] Here is what I might call an /English Zen/. More about EZ later.

[fn:5] Perhaps give the Smokies a second chance by reading the
pre-park fictional work /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_(novel)][Christy]]/ by Catherine Marshall. She captures
something that might be called /Appalachian Gothic/.

[fn:6] Allow me the poetic emphasis device of capitalising nouns.

[fn:7] Quick preliminary, much more later: The term Romanticism
followed a twisted path beginning with the Latin /romant/, or, "in the
Roman manner", thus, not at all our current use of the word as a
synonym of love. In general, bundling what I'm trying to get at as
/Romanticism/ is fraught to say the least. Academe wants to grip
butterflies, but when they open their hands there is only goo. Lots
more on this problem as we go...

[fn:8] One very important principal, the German poet [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novalis][Novalis]] (penname
for Baron Friedrich von Hardenberg), often used his unique /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_fragment][fragment]]/
style to describe his Dark Muse. And so he abandoned even lyrical
poetry to get even more bursty, more spontaneous in order to capture
the subtleties of his impressions. Lots more about Novalis, the
presumed founder of German Romanticism, as we go along.

[fn:9] ...goth described [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goth_subculture][here]] as well as anywhere. \\
[[file:images/RyderBeetlejuice.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:10] BTW, the Germans capitalise nouns, i.e., built-in poetic
emphasis.

[fn:11] Yes, MHGA: Make Halloween Great Again \\
[[file:images/Santos-Halloween-regular-Diamond.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:12] Why do people age out of goth? A crude answer may be they just
can't kick the rebel chic can down the beach any longer ... there, I
said it...

[fn:13] Retrenchment towards what, exactly? Orwell's /1984/?

[fn:14] ...while so much of our modern poetry is screed doggerel. For
example, Allen Ginsberg acclaimed /Howl/ is really social-political
pamphleteering in verse, not true poetry as it has been known for
centuries. And from there things go downhill fast---into the most
ridiculous absurdist nihilist nonsense.

[fn:15] ...due perhaps to one of my Victorian Era-heavy schoolmarms?

[fn:16] Oddly enough, I've never read her /Wuthering Heights/ and do
not intend to. (More about why later.) Basically, it would be like
watching Marian Anderson sing a bawdy sailor's song. However, her
poetry I read continually, discovering new things, gleaning deeper
insights each time. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB][here]] for a quick biography.  \\
[[file:images/Emily_Brontë_by_Patrick_Branwell_Brontë_restored.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:17] /Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders/

[fn:18] See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Rossetti][here]] for a bio. She is considered by many Britain's
most prolific poet. \\
[[file:images/RossettiAge16.jpg]] \\

[fn:19] Yes, poems, as the Dark Muse seems to find its best, most
concentrated expression through poetry. Much more on why mainly poetry
delivers the ineffable of darkness later.

[fn:20] Go [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow][here]] for a quick biography. HWL was not typically Dark,
rather, a popular, "uplifting" poet with a big audience. That's what
makes this selection so unique for me.

[fn:21] Below we will go over Romanticism poetising's originator,
Novalis.

[fn:22] Events in life, especially hardships, are supposed to
/increase/ our emotional depth and maturity, not become excuses for
anti-social behaviour and emotional immaturity as we so often see
today.

[fn:23] /modus vivendi/: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, /or/ (literally) a way of living.

[fn:24] Doom as unforeseen consequences of previous actions, which in
turn, entropically snowball into indebtedness, tragedy, and ruin;
typically multi-generational, a punishment that never seems to fit the
original crime---if it was a crime at all. One German word for doom is
/Untergang/, which also means /downfall/.

[fn:25] Queen Victoria in mourning black ca. 1862. \\
[[file:images/QueenVictoriaInMourningBlack.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:26] Is there anything worse than the so-called /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief][five stages of
grief]]/ or the Kübler-Ross model? Grief as an emotional malfunction
to be systematically reduced, fixed, corrected? Alas.

[fn:27] Lots more about my novel as we go.

[fn:28] See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson][here]] for a quick biography. \\
[[file:images/EmilyDickinson.png]]
\\
\\

[fn:29] In the third line, /Heft/ means weight, heaviness; importance,
influence; /or/ (archaic) the greater part or bulk of something.

[fn:30] Dickinson freely employed the capitalising of nouns for poetic
emphasis.

[fn:31] My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson is based on
their earthly abodes---Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.

[fn:32] Is it not ironic how nearly all lifeforms that attempt to
share our human environments uninvited are considered invasive,
noxious vermin, pests to which we have developed almost hysterical
revulsion?

[fn:33] However cotton was rapidly becoming a global commodity, both
cotton and wool fabrics eventually being produced in steam-powered
factories as the Industrial Age reached its inflexion point of growth.

[fn:34] In any modern (non-organic Amazon Whole Foods-style)
supermarket I'm sure less that 1% of the food items come from a truly
local source. Nearly everything is shipped in from often far afar.

[fn:35] ...e.g., what is a flower garden but a derivative, a mock-up
of an original place out in the wilds, albeit with the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits left, weeded out?

[fn:36] How often is a Shakespeare character out communing with
nature? Never?...

[fn:37] Churches were typically built in the centre of a town or city
on the highest ground. I once heard that to this day no building in
Vienna may be built taller than the tower of St. Stephen's Cathedral.

[fn:38] ...with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as a leading
style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
"revivalist-nostalgic" (Greek, Gothic, Italianate, Elizabethan, Queen
Anne, etc.), perhaps a hearkening back to times more integrated with
nature, with shallower gradients between indoors and outdoors?

[fn:39] Human population grew 60% between 1800 and 1900, and /260%/
between 1900 and 2000.

[fn:40] Modern human narratives come at us as thousands upon thousands
of fictional novels, films, plays, while aboriginal peoples had myth
and legends timeless and unchanging. That alone...

[fn:41] Is our relatively gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog][boiling frog]] metaphor?

[fn:42] What became of Wordsworth's /[[https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45560/to-a-highland-girl][To a Highland Girl]]/ shepherdess
when she and her family were forced into an industrial urban slum? We
can only hope she and her kin are in a better place now...

[fn:43] In those days wild, untouched places were often referred to as
wastelands.

[fn:44] What is generally acknowledged as a clear breakthrough was
John Snow's tracing of the London cholera outbreak of 1854 back to
certain London neighborhood publich wells. This was strong proof of
the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease][contagion theory]]. However, it wasn't until the late nineteenth
century that Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur established the field of
bacteriology and our modern scientific understanding of microscopic
pathogens finally developed.

[fn:45] Couple this mechanistic "death as malfunction" with atheist
nihilism to arrive at today's soulless mechanical universe realism
dumpster fire.

[fn:46] For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are---outside of war and homicidal aggression---all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.

[fn:47] Consider [[https://youtu.be/SMNGhPgCKzw?si=L4HFHQuUTnP3j8I6][this quite tolerable goth version]] of the classic rock
song. Had this been written in Brontëan times, it would have been no
cheap, sentimental gimmick.

[fn:48] Consider the commonplace heart pacemaker, a device that
literally overrides the human heart with artificial electronic pulses.

[fn:49] Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.

[fn:50] Anne Brontë's grave in Scarborough \\
[[file:images/AnneBrontesGrave2.png]]
\\
Perhaps watch [[https://youtu.be/_yzBEP3Qyvc?si=QBkrGikYxWP7C9eN][this]] on Anne's last days in Scarborough. \\
\\

[fn:51] Abiah Root (Strong) \\
[[file:images/DickinsonFriendAbiahRoot.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:52] ...the third volume, /Fragmente/, of /Novalis: Werke, Briefe,
Dokumente/; Verlag Lambert Schneider; 1957.

[fn:53] Coleridge and Wordsworth's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyrical_Ballads][Lyrical Ballads]]/, first edition
appearing in 1798.

[fn:54] Started ca. 1797, finally published in 1800. The German
/Hymnen/ (plural of /Hymne/) means "praising songs"
(/Lobgesang)/. Allow me the abbreviation /HttN/ from here on. Try
[[https://www.george-macdonald.com/etexts/hymns_to_night.html][this
George MacDonald translation]] as found in a publication from 1897.

[fn:55] ...referred to as the /Jena Set/ by Andrea Wulf in her
/Magnificent Rebels, The First Romantics and the Invention of the
Self/ by Andrea Wulf; 2022; Vintage Books. More about this flawed
account in a section below.

[fn:56] See the Wikipedia explanation of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism][Romanticism]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Romanticism][German
Romanticism]] ... but with a grain of salt. As I repeat throughout, the
main purpose of WutheringUK is to wrest Romanticism and especially
Dark away from the ivory tower humanities technocrats.

[fn:57] The German /Poesie/ is typically translated as simply
/poetry/; however, poetry as a concept beyond just the literary art,
more towards the older /poesy/ perhaps. And of course Novalis and the
Jena Set expanded even further...

[fn:58] I will go into how Romanticism is a fata morgana in detail
soon.

[fn:59] If you must, read [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/novalis/][this about Novalis]], which is as good as
any. But as academe is wont to do, it hangs on every word uttered,
written by a young man feeling his way along in his twenties. This
approach may work with Einstein, but not a twenty-something poet...

[fn:60] Lots more on eighteenth-century English Gothic below.

[fn:61] But /HttN/ wasn't entirely new after all. Soon will be
discussed similar offerings from the previous eighteenth century.

[fn:62] We'll dive into Edgar Allan Poe's very similar idealisations
in his possibly most popular poem /Annabel Lee/ soon.

[fn:63] Yes, give Wulf's /Magnificent Rebels/ a shot. But you'll
quickly realise she is more like a gossip columnist going on about
celebrities than someone who understands what they were actually
doing. For all intents and purposes, she might as well be describing
Andy Warhol's /Factory/, a place where social buzz was more important
than the actual art.

[fn:64] Again, /LB/ is bereft of Dark, although Nature is spot-on
romanticised.

[fn:65] *penetralium*: (plural /penetralia/) the innermost (or most
secret) part of a building; an inner sanctum; a sanctum sanctorum.

[fn:66] *verisimilar*: having the appearance of truth.

[fn:67] [[https://youtu.be/bASfrZYnkvI?si=JKGP2LiHgOj-h9oL][Here]] is the scene from the bio-pic /Bright Star/.

[fn:68] /The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature's Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work/ by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.

[fn:69] Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven't noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats' primary food sources.

[fn:70] A stay in Belgium to learn French and a short-lived gig in
nearby Halifax as a governess.

[fn:71] We consume upwards of one hundred times the resources and
energy per capita as did one of our European ancestors from
1800 ... and so the bigger the dance floor, the crazier the dancing.

[fn:72] There is nothing really otherworldly Dark or Romanticist as I
know it about Jane Austen, sadly. She was seemingly devoid,
non-pursuant of Dostoyevski's POEH. Although she once did say,
"Pictures of perfection, as you know, make me sick and wicked."
(Letter to her niece Fanny Knight, 23 March 1817.)

[fn:73] From my 1853 copy \\
[[file:images/NightThoughtsBook2.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:74]  YMMV. Personally, I like a good doom-and-gloom session, and
Young really delivers with /Night Thoughts/. Later we'll go into Emily
Brontë's take on doom-and-gloom, her more measured Christian
perspective.

[fn:75] ...that is, in a past age not exposed to the science of modern
public relations. See [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays][this]] about Edward Bernays and the birth of
modern advertising and public relations. TL;DR: Since Bernays, no
"movement" in our modern times can be considered natural and organic,
rather, the result of somebody's financed public relations campaign.

[fn:76] /Das Land der Dichter und Denker/. Intentionally absent was
novelists. Although now novelists count as part of /die Belletristik/,
i.e., /schöngeistige Literatur/ or aesthetic literature.

[fn:77] Two terms, /novel/ (English) and /roman/ (French, German,
etc. from the adjectival /Roman/, /Roman-like/) came to describe any
long-form prose story-telling.

[fn:78] Ironically, the /Novella/, a long short-story format with no
chapter breaks, was better tolerated in Germany.

[fn:79] One giveaway is /gothic/ in the title. Perhaps read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction][this
overview]] of Gothic fiction.

[fn:80] Walpole initially claimed /Otranto/ to be a medieval
manuscript he had discovered and translated, when all along it had
been his own creation.

[fn:81] ...although this is ironic since the actual label Gothic had
been used pejoratively in the Renaissance alluding to the destructive
barbarian Goths, i.e., Gothic architecture was crude and barbaric.

[fn:82] A model woebegone gothic novel heroine (from /El Mundo
ilustrado/; 1879). \\
[[file:images/VictorianWomanOnBeach_side.png]] \\
\\

[fn:83] Once asked why his horror films were so popular, Alfred
Hitchcock said the man on the street likes to occasionally dip his toe
in the lake of horror.

[fn:84] ...although Wordsworth would later mention Barbauld and
/ASEM/ as inspirational.

[fn:85] A quote from M.H. Abrams' laborious /The Mirror and the Lamp/
would insist \\
/Even an aesthetic philosophy so abstract and seemingly academic as
that of Kant can be shown to have modified the work of poets./ \\
Really? I doubt the Brontë sisters read much Kant. But then Abrams
never mentions the Brontës...

[fn:86] The Jena Set's Friedrich Schlegel first used /romantic/ in
contrast to /classic/ to describe what they were doing in Jena, but it
wasn't until the 1820s until the term Romanticism became widely known
and used---evermore poorly...

[fn:87] Notably absent is *Romanticism = Dark*...

[fn:88] From the outset, the Schlegels in Jena made Shakespeare a
principal proto-Romanticist, Ludwig Tieck and others of the Jena Set
feverishly translating his plays into German. For me this was a clear
sign they were on the wrong road. I will eventually have my fictional
character from my novel /Emily of Wolkeld/ tell you why.

[fn:89] So convenient that Jena Romanticism came about in a for its
time conspicuously free-wheeling university town, many of the Jena Set
lecturers and professors at the University of Jena. Perhaps a modern
version would have been [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mountain_College][Black Mountain College]].

[fn:90] ...my italics...

[fn:91] What would the esteemed Oxford professor say after following
an aboriginal witchdoctor around for a few days? Something very
similar, I dare say.

[fn:92] A bit of my folk psychology: All twisted (sic), screwed-up
people have this in common: They've attempted to wall off some strand
or cut out a section of their emotion braid.

[fn:93] ...due to ignorance of Novalis? Alas...

[fn:94] A scholar mentioned in the Wikipedia articles says,
/[Wordsworth manages] to see into the life of things only 'by
narrowing and skewing his field of vision' and by excluding 'certain
conflictual sights and meanings'/. Obviously Wordsworth was a male
apologist for the capitalist industrialist patriarchy, ignoring that so
very many women and minorities were being oppresses exactly as he saw
those sights and penned those lines...

[fn:95] ...and certainly no inkling of what I spoke of above about the
modern indoor-outdoor dichotomy being irrelevant.

[fn:96] So ironic how /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)][naturalism]]/ means nature sans any metaphysics,
completely materialist mechanistic from the micro to the macro. Though
the term has the feel of instinctive, genuine, candid, sincere, e.g.,
the smile of a dear friend... Woe. Alas.

[fn:97] A vacation destination, perhaps, as Wordsworth and Coleridge
popularised the Lake District as the world's first lit/eco-tourism
destination.

[fn:98] ...named in 1843.

[fn:99] /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_homini_lupus][Man is a wolf to man]]/.

[fn:100] ...and they were routinely left out of academic analysis of
Romanticism, e.g., Abrams' /The Mirror and the Lamp/, Beach's /The
Concept of Nature in Nineteenth-Century English Poetry/, and Berlin's
/The Roots of Romanticism/ make no mention of them! Maybe they had
read [[https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Bronte-upload-4.pdf][Virginia Woolf's comments on /Jane Eyre/]] and gave them up for a
bad job. See [[https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/19/virginia-woolf-in-bronte-country-jane-eyre][this analysis]] as well. Big cringe...

[fn:101] ...as opposed to /sacred/ nostalgia, i.e., a heartfelt hearkening,
yearning for the profound eternal and epic, which should not be
dependent on context or seen as escapism to the past.

[fn:102] Millais' /The Blind Girl (1854-56)/ \\
[[file:images/MillaisTheBlindGirl1854-56.jpg]] \\
\\

[fn:103] The typical middle-class industrialist coming up during the
Enlightenment was a pragmatic utilitarian who, after absorbing the
message of Adam Smith's /The Wealth of Nations/ (1776), had jettisoned
the baggage of noblesse oblige, the New Testament beatitudes, and any
lingering other-century nostalgia and sentimentality to forge ahead as
the consummate self-reliant individualist laser-focused on financial
wealth. These men projected a stripped-down emotional psychological
persona, indeed, a new desensitisation regime.

[fn:104] I say "westernised Eastern" because we in the West cannot
possibly know what real Eastern is, not being genetically or
culturally truly Eastern. We only think we can rationalise the
irrational number Eastern.

[fn:105] Again, let's forget her book /Wuthering Heights/, which for me
is just gothic novel handle-cranking, however artistically potent. As
before, I suspect an inevitable inability for prose to do what poetry
does. Likewise, Poe lost much altitude when he would switch from
poetry to prose. That is to say, Brontë and Poe said deep and lasting
things in their verse, but simply added pulp to the gothic novel shelf
with their prose.

[fn:106] \\
[[file:images/VWoolf.jpg]] \
\\

[fn:107] *Pathetic* from Middle French /pathetique/ "provoking emotion,"
borrowed from Late Latin /pathēticus/ "affecting the emotions," borrowed
from Greek /pathētikós/ "capable of feeling, emotional, receptive,
passive, i.e., not pathetic as we today use it to mean sad and
contemptible.

[fn:108] /Deus sive Natura/, the slogan of Baruch Spinoza's pantheism:
the view that god and nature are interchangeable, or that there is no
distinction between the creator and the creation.

[fn:109] Perhaps see [[https://youtu.be/6TK9c-caEcw?si=VfMnEZFDX9QXrIPX][Bertrand Russell on his meeting with Vladimir
Lenin in 1920]].

[fn:110] Sometimes the apologists throw in the towel to complete
absurdism. Consider [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutalist_architecture][Brutalism]] where ugliness is normalised.

[fn:111] ...e.g., we would never have known Emily Brontë's poetry had
not sister Charlotte pilfered her manuscripts from their hiding place
and published them without her sister's permission. Similarly, the
reclusive Emily Dickinson only half-heartedly ever sought
publication. During her life only ten poems were published, but after
her death /over a thousand/ were discovered in her room and
subsequently published. In general, how many Barbaulds, Brontës,
Dickinsons, Poes didn't make the recognition cut?

[fn:112] Academe typically fences the Romantic Era in between 1800
and 1850.

[fn:113] ...e.g., the Brontës were pastor's daughters in rural West
Yorkshire with little exposure to (taint from?) the cultural and
literary buzz of the cities.

[fn:114] One hot mess is the [[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0144q90/episodes/guide][BBC's series on Romanticism]]. (Catch it on

Bertrand Russell in his severe, left-brained /The History of Western
Philosophy/ mangles away at Romanticism in his consummate pedantic
way. These are Exhibit A1/A2 of people who don't get it but must sound
important erudite. More palatable perhaps is [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIffazJIrLo&list=PLhP9EhPApKE_9uxkmfSIt2JJK6oKbXmd-&pp=iAQB][Isaiah Berlin's 1965
lectures on Romanticism]] which starts with his admission that it just
might have all been in the air---and still is.

[fn:115] The best ideas about left/right brain are those of Iain
McGilchrist. Try [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK7XG3t2nFg&list=PLqBHk3itxyPDKFnwj8-SmlwHra64cCrky&pp=iAQB][these]].

[fn:116] [[https://engines.egr.uh.edu/english-romanticism/what-romanticism][This]] will save you some googling. Note again the tortured
origin of the term /romantic/.

[fn:117] For what it's worth, German Romanticism can be broken down
into Jena, Heidelberg, then Berlin Romanticism based largely on the
principle artists.

[fn:121] Platonic as opposed to romantic-sexual love was seen in the
past as a higher, deeper, quasi-sacred form of love, i.e., the love
going on in heaven between the saints and angels brought down to
Earth. Today, however, we are made to understand by the modernist
Freudians that the human is only a crazed sex monkey, and any other
view is delusional puerile. Thus, desensitisation is the answer to
"sexual hangups."

[fn:122] Not only is Emily Dickinson trashed, they trash other big
names of the American Romantic Era. Try [[https://youtu.be/3tO8ol9j34s?si=DQifICJs3tJgpi9O][this]], then
[[https://youtu.be/LmneLDB6hAI?si=sSef_hvjshiTbV1b][this]]. Crrringe... And just when you thought it couldn't get worse,
[[https://youtu.be/pFp05alGLow?si=tTk-5CPhmpdkeQ3R][this music video]] by the actress portraying Emily Dickinson is
attached to the series as its supposed theme song. Alas...

per [[https://slate.com/culture/2023/02/emily-bronte-movie-true-story-wuthering-heights.html][this]] Slate review. No need to watch, just read [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_(2022_film)#Plot][the plot]] for full
cringe. \\

[fn:124] I contend libertarianism is simply a new form of liberalism,
i.e., liberalism has gotten so big that leftism no longer is big
enough to contain it all.

[fn:125] Really though, calling it /Lake/ Superior is
like calling Einstein a high school graduate.

[fn:126] Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her longer than
ten minutes can lead to hypothermia ... at least on the North
Coast. Though the south beaches of Wisconsin and Michigan can be
swimmable in the height of summer.

[fn:128] And of course the joke, Want to make God laugh? Tell Him your
plans. Or the German, /Der Mensch denkt, der Gott lenkt/ or, The human
thinks, God steers.
