<h2 id="org651f861">The Great Internet Detox</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org651f861">
<p>
Here I&rsquo;ve finally got my website up and running and I immediately want
to go cold-turkey from the internet? Ironic for sure. But if I am
supposedly on some sort of back-to-nature nostalgia trip, or as some
have called it, &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottagecore">Cottagecore</a>,&rdquo; then I should not pretend to be like
some Henry David Thoreau back in his offline, off-grid cottage in the
woods, all while running a very connected, high-tech online presence.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s be honest, the internet has proven to be one step forward and
two steps backward for most of society. I&rsquo;ve noticed how being online
has changed me, my daily habits and routines, and I know I&rsquo;m suffering
for it, i.e., what I&rsquo;ve gotten out of it lags far behind the negative
consequences.<label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.6439167' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.6439167' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
There is no end to the hand-wringing of experts about the
deleterious effects of too much internet screen time.
</span> And so I want to &ldquo;get off the internet/screen.&rdquo;
But of course that&rsquo;s not entirely possible in this day and
age&#x2014;unless we live like an off-grid, offline hermit in the
woods. Hence, I want to &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; get off, by which I mean I will
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>only be online to do absolutely necessary work-related things</li>
<li>one daily check of only email, phone, or messages</li>
<li>absolutely no &ldquo;social media&rdquo; e.g., Facebook, Instagram, X/Twitter, etc.</li>
<li>no online reference or research</li>
<li>no online entertainment</li>
<li>only the most absolute bare necessities from online stores</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course this may seem draconian, especially the bit about no
reference or research online. Why? Because the temptation to keep
click and swiping and scrolling is ever-present, that experts say this
whole screen-online experience has very real psychological addiction
issues. But hey, let&rsquo;s just slow down!
</p>

<p>
I plan to dive into my German lit again, which I&rsquo;ve neglected for so
long. I do have plenty of real, hold-in-hands books that have been
gathering dust for many years. Now is the time to get out of the
internet rat race.
</p>

<p>
It will be hard. I know because I&rsquo;ve tried and failed many times
before. Internet-screen addiction is a very insidious, and going off
this constantly connected state leaves me feeling&#x2014;detached, adrift,
lost, depressed, anxious, without purpose or meaning. But I know that
I&rsquo;m only getting fake fulfillment from being online, that whomever I
imagine myself engaging with is complete illusion. Who&rsquo;s to say we are
not at some ChatGPT juncture where some chatbot is pretending to be my
advocate, friend, supporter&#x2014;as in the frightening film <i>Her</i>?
</p>

<p>
I once thought I&rsquo;d really do this whole project up, i.e., not just
internet detox, but do a sort of &ldquo;historical reenactment theater&rdquo;
where I would pretend to be a German nobleman (in period costume) come
to the American wilds for to gather observations, a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville">Alexis de
Tocqueville</a>. No, just getting offline will be a good beginning.
</p>

<p>
I also thought that once I got this Wuthering.UK site up I&rsquo;d launch a
total media blitz, anchored by a YouTube channel where I&rsquo;d do videos
after videos and get real famous and rich. But then I thought, Does
the world need another braying ass going on about how he knows better
than all the other braying asses? No. I&rsquo;ve come to a very big
realization in my life, namely, that I really don&rsquo;t know
anything. Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t been able to forgive/ignore those
around me who know even less; hence, a detox will help me work on this
last hurdle to absolute perfection.
