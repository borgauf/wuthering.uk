<div id="outline-container-org3f63f7f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3f63f7f">The Left pushed the commoners too far</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3f63f7f">
<p>
The simplest way to explain Donald Trump&rsquo;s victory is to realize the
Left tried to push the common man/woman too far. For many years now
the Left has been pushing the Average Janes and Joes, the <i>Everyman</i>,
the salt of the earth, yes, the <i>peasants</i> to go too many places they
just couldn&rsquo;t go, to do too many things they just couldn&rsquo;t do.
</p>

<p>
As sociologist Jonathan Haidt said (and I paraphrase liberally), The
Left is rabidly anti-past. They believe the past is a graveyard of our
mistakes, that the present is the best time to be alive; thus, they
throw a flying wall of hyper-idealistic leftisms at society in order
to keep correcting supposed social ills and historical mistakes. The
Right, on the other hand, believes just the opposite, i.e., that some
past age was golden, and that we must return to it. When you
understand this, you understand a whole lot about today&rsquo;s politics
&#x2026; and why Trump won. His <i>Make America Great Again</i> slogan is pure
nostalgia for the past. Trump and his forces aim to stop the leftist
flying wall of hyper-idealisms. But then what? Where is this nostalgic
Netherland?
</p>

<p>
Haidt has also described how a certain sector of the population,
basically these same Everyman types, when pushed too far, have a
tendency to &ldquo;snap back.&rdquo; By that he means they will reach desperately
for a leader who promises immediate relief from the dysphoria of
having their status quo threatened, of having been pushed too far
leftward. As I&rsquo;ve written before, humans are far less &ldquo;group-logical&rdquo;
and far more susceptible to herd stampede or &ldquo;freak-out&rdquo; than we like
to admit. That is to say, we collectively freak-out, sometimes
completely irrationally, with devastating consequences. Germany in the
1930s freaked out, snapped hard-Right&#x2014;and the rest is history. A
line had been crossed, and the common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Michel">German <i>Michel</i></a> reacted
strongly.
</p>

<p>
What all right-wing dictators have in common is impatience. If the
vehicle of state is going down Highway Wrong Way at 120 mph, the
dictator immediately throws the transmission into reverse&#x2014;with
devastating results. But don&rsquo;t worry, Trump will not be able to do
this. There are still enough checks and balances to hold him to a
slower pace. How do I know this? Read on.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org648c2f4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org648c2f4">Trump is a showman</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org648c2f4">
<p>
Yes, Trump is certainly a showman. But so was Hitler. The difference
was that many of the 1930s German Powers That Be privately were for,
encouraged Hitler to seize dictatorial power. Nobody is seriously
doing that with Trump&#x2014;other that perhaps Steve Bannon. Yes, American
democracy is definitely ailing. When elections are not accepted by one
side, as in the 2020 election, then democracy is basically over. And
yet Trump vacated the White House and his followers did not morph into
<i>Sturmabteilung</i> Brownshirt street-thug paramilitaries. Which means
our democracy is in critical condition but not yet dead. Somehow the
checks and balances are holding.

<h3 id="org6ee8555">MAGA = nostalgia, but&#x2026;</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6ee8555">
<p>
Again, nostalgia for what exactly? This of course is where any
nostalgic fantasizing breaks down, i.e., on the details of what MAGA
would actually mean and become.
</p>

<p>
At least in theory we could all become like the ultra-conservative
Amish. After all, the Amish actively hold to a strict set of rules and
principles that keep them &ldquo;back&rdquo; from modern times.<label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.8811130' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.8811130' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
The Amish and Mennonites refer to themselves as <i>Die Stillen im
Lande</i> or &ldquo;the quiet in the land&rdquo;, which is a reference to Psalms
35:20: <i>For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
against them that are quiet in the land.</i>
</span> But could a
whole society ever agree on which rules and principles to artificially
hold to? And with resources so liberalized,<label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.3919073' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.3919073' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
Consider the fact that you are consuming easily <i>one hundred
times!</i> the resources and energy of an ancestor from two hundred years
ago. This is an exponential liberalization of resource consumption.
</span> materialism so
expanded that social liberalization could only follow, how to pack all
that back into Pandora&rsquo;s Box? Such strict, draconian laws and rules as
from some past &ldquo;Golden Age&rdquo; would be nigh on impossible to enact and
maintain nation-wide. Short of an apocalyptic Dark Age throwing <i>all</i>
of society back into a quasi-Stone Age, we cannot put the
liberalization genie back in the bottle&#x2014;except in artificially
staged ways as do the Amish who are surrounded by the resource- and
socially-liberal world. Think about a monk or nun sitting in a
monastery or convent. Every second of every day they subconsciously
know they could walk away from the aesthete life of minimalism and
self-denial, which is why I say&#x2026;
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgbec9ad4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbec9ad4">Trump is <i>not</i> conservative</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgbec9ad4">
<p>
No, Trump is not really conservative, rather, he is libertarian. And
libertarianism is really just a new form of liberal. I&rsquo;m saying
<i>liberalism has gotten so big that Leftism can no longer contain it
all</i> and some has spilled into this limbo nether-region frontier
outside of Leftism&#x2014;to be claimed, falsely labeled as
conservatism.
</p>

<p>
So what is true conservatism? Real conservatism is when every part of
life is geared towards conserving, first, resources, then behaviors
necessarily tracking with that conservative resource base. Think
Medieval Age England with its limited space and good soil, its
periodic famines, maxed-out forestry,<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.8006679' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.8006679' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
Think about it. The forest was the hypercritical base of
life. From it came wood for housing and heat. The forest had to be
tightly controlled and managed exactly correctly. That is, none of
this modern clear-cut-and-run crap.
</span> harsh winters,
etc. Conservatism had to be the way of life.
</p>

<p>
I say in this modern landscape of wall-to-wall, play-now-pay-later
materialism that no real conservatism is possible. Again, a tight
resource base necessitates conservative behaviors. And we no long have
these conditions. Thus, any conservatism today is strictly <i>pro
forma</i>, at best some nostalgic throwback; thus, riddled with
libertarianisms, i.e., liberalism that is not leftist. This means
Trumpism is really just a peasant rebellion, he the peasant
chieftain. Which we&rsquo;ve seen before, and typically go nowhere and must
be put down. Yes&#x2026;

Way back in the early 1800s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a> made a serious
break with Romanticists of his time, calling Romanticism and its
followers &ldquo;everything that is sick about modern society.&rdquo;<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.4693493' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.4693493' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
It would be helpful to read my essay where I discuss the
Romantic Era. Click on the icon top left and click on <i>Preface.</i>
</span> There
is a whole universe behind this simple-seeming pronouncement.
</p>

<p>
As you may know Goethe<label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.7288065' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.7288065' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>

Goethe (far right), the Duke, and actress-muse Corona Schröter out for
a stroll, probably discussing how Classicism must fight back against
the sickness of Romanticsim. <br>
<br>
</span> was the leading German intellectual and
Germany&rsquo;s most lauded bard of his time. But he broke with the leaders,
the artists of Romanticism (beginning ca. 1800 in Jena) mainly due to
their largely irresponsible behavior and airy-fairy ideas. Goethe,
born middle-class, had been ennobled, placed by his liege Karl August,
Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach in charge of various Weimar Court
posts. He was also a &ldquo;veteran&rdquo; of the disastrous French Revolution,
which had given most &ldquo;freedom fighters&rdquo; of the time pause. Basically,
Goethe could not accept that the best-and-brightest, the educated
elite of the times were being irresponsible, off chasing &ldquo;feelings,&rdquo;
fairies in the forests,<label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.6487660' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.6487660' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
&#x2026;as his contemporary Ludwig Tieck brought out in his &ldquo;Big
Three&rdquo; novellas: <i>Eckbert the Fair</i>, <i>The Elves</i>, and <i>Runenberg</i>
which were a cross of fairy tale and gothic lit.
</span> waxing nostalgic for the Medieval Age or
some proto-European times, acting aloof from the cares of the day. He
countered Romanticism with his take on Classicism which came to be
called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Classicism">Weimar Classicism</a></i> where looking back to the high aesthetics
of the Greeks was the place to start. But isn&rsquo;t this exactly what the
Trump side is saying about today&rsquo;s Intelligentsia and educated elites?
Pragmatism, feet on the ground was lacking from Romaticism&#x2014;as
evidenced in today&rsquo;s flying wall of leftist hyper-idealisms coming at
us from our supposed best-and-brightest.

<p>
<i>The Jetsons</i> was an animated sitcom from 1962-63 showing us what
future space-age suburban life would be like. I was a little kid back
then and we all thrilled to each episode. So exciting, so cool it was
to think about all the great technological advancements just around
the corner. But when the film <i>The Graduate</i> came out in 1967 dealing
head-on with vapid, dysfunctional, existential meaningless
middle-class suburban life, something had changed and modern life was
mysteriously suspect, expectations seriously downgraded.<label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.5679331' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.5679331' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
Contrast <i>The Graduate</i> with <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> (1969),
which depicted human technological advancement as our quasi-mystical
destiny.
</span> Sure,
we limped along for the next decades with progress, even &ldquo;futurism,&rdquo;
but the space race seemed stuck in those largely meaningless space
shuttle launches, the push to get kids into STEM tanked, and the only
truly positive sci-fi, <i>Star Trek</i> gave it up with the early
cancellation of <i>Enterprise</i> in 2005.<label id='fnr.8' for='fnr-in.8.4390980' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.8.4390980' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup>
And no, <i>Star Wars</i> was always just a &ldquo;lite&rdquo; version of
dystopian cyberpunk.
</span> Odd how
humans&#x2014;narrative-based as we are&#x2014;have had no real positive,
futuristic storytelling to latch onto since those halcyon 1960s.
</p>

<p>
And so I ask, How can technologically, materialistically forward not
be the way forward anymore? Think about it. Humans strove for
centuries to reach the science and technology pinnacle we had achieved
by the 1960s&#x2014;with even more amazing advances right around the
corner! But for some reason the air started leaking out of the tires,
positive thinking about the future waned, and many of us became
doubters, questioning and even rejecting the high-tech, the
materialism, the progress, the wealth, the modernism. And so today we
are gripped by an anomie, an ennui of seemingly unknown origins.<label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.8478366' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.8478366' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
<i>anomie</i>: lack of the usual social or ethical standards in an
individual or group. <br>
<i>ennui</i>: a feeling of listlessness and dissatisfaction arising from a
lack of occupation or excitement.
</span>
</p>

<p>
You might say progress is still humming along. The iPhone is version
16, the electric vehicles are beginning to get solid-state batteries,
wind and solar are much cheaper than any fossil fuel, huge rockets are
now grabbed by mechanical chopsticks upon reentry, and the computing
world is roaring forward with AI, robotics, quantum computing. And yet
I can see the peak, i.e., the end of this mad rush. The spirit is
surely waning, the dynamism just about to crash and burn. Oh yes, a
small elite core are still driving on with their amazing
overachieving, but the man on the street could care less. Complexity
grows, technology rocks&#x2014;but the average citizen is regressing back
to a medieval level of knowledge and education.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, we&rsquo;re stalling out. And all sorts of quasi-nostalgia peddlers
are coming out of the woodwork to entice the masses into&#x2014;into what
exactly? But then if the way forward is not forward as we&rsquo;ve defined
it for literally centuries, then what are we doing, <i>where are we
going</i>? Ever since this unbelievable, impossible to have predicted sea
change of progress stalling out, I&rsquo;ve noticed everything slowly coming
unraveled in society. Now I see the predictions of the cyberpunk
near-future dystopian stories coming true, all while things still seem
to be functioning, suburbs are occupied, and modern high-tech
materialism is still on track. And yet people are heading to various
nostalgic exit doors. My boys grew up in the 2000s with <i>Lord of the
Rings</i> and <i>Harry Potter</i>, two vaguely medieval nostalgia trips.<label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.7457167' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.7457167' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
Most fail to see that the &ldquo;wizarding world&rdquo; was really just a
Medieval Age holdover running parallel to the &ldquo;muggle&rdquo; modern
world. The so-called <i>Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office</i> underlined
how the wizarding world saw human technology as just so many
artifacts, i.e., curious but inferior.
</span>
Then the fantasy wave, all of it set in some quasi-past, typically a
parallel Medieval Age. This alongside very grimy, depressing dystopian
near-future &ldquo;cyberpunk&rdquo; sci-fi basically slamming the door on the
future. No more Jetsons and no more positive Utopian sci-fi. But then
The Powers That Be tried to slam the nostalgia door with <i>Game of
Thrones</i>, which wanted the Medieval Age to be awful horrible. But it&rsquo;s
too late. The modern world is paralyzed in ennui and great confusion
over what direction we should go. Basically, the entire Muslim world
is reaching for something bygone. The main radical factions are all
some version of primitivists. Then all the autocrats doing Backwards
like Putin et al. Alas. And no, Elon Musk isn&rsquo;t going to revive some
Jetsons futurism.
</p>

<p>
This is really crazy when you think about it. Consider how
scientifically advanced the Covid vaccines were. To hear the science
behind the mRNA is to marvel at how so much advancement came together
so perfectly. Never before had a vaccine been rolled out so quickly
and had such off-the-charts efficacy. But then came the huge
irrationalist backlash, the all but superstitious opposition
demonizing the vaccines. So many people these days have become
degenerate, disenchanted, dysfunctional, depressed, cynical, addicted,
etc. all because they&rsquo;ve somehow missed the progress bus. Why is all
this amazing progress not taken up by more people and used as a
springboard to amazing lives and Utopian pursuits? Crazy weird this
situation. Don&rsquo;t know how it will end.

</span> then I should not pretend to be like I&rsquo;m Henry David
Thoreau back in his offline/off-grid cottage in the woods, all while
running a very plugged-in, connected, high-tech online presence.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s be honest, the internet has proven to be one step forward and
two steps backward for most of society. I&rsquo;ve noticed how being online
has changed me, my daily habits and routines, and I know I&rsquo;m suffering
for it, i.e., what I&rsquo;ve gotten out of it lags far behind the negative
consequences.<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.4875638' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.4875638' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>
There is no end to the hand-wringing of experts about the
deleterious effects of too much internet screen time.
</span> And so I want to get off the internet and avoid
screens&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;but of course that&rsquo;s not entirely possible in this day and
age&#x2014;unless we actually do live like an off-grid, offline hermit in
the woods. Hence, I want to &ldquo;mainly&rdquo; get off, by which I mean I will
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>only be online to do absolutely necessary work-related things</li>
<li>one daily check of only email, phone, or messages</li>
<li>absolutely no &ldquo;social media&rdquo; e.g., Facebook, Instagram, X/Twitter, etc.</li>
<li>no online reference or research</li>
<li>no online entertainment</li>
<li>only the most absolute bare necessities from online stores, i.e., no
browsing shopping.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course this may seem draconian, especially the bit about no
reference or research online. Why? Because the temptation to keep
click and swiping and scrolling is ever-present, that experts say this
whole screen-online experience has very real psychological addiction
issues. But hey, let&rsquo;s just slow down!
</p>

<p>
I plan to dive into my German lit again, which I&rsquo;ve neglected for so
long. I do have plenty of real, hold-in-hands books that have been
gathering dust for many years. Now is the time to get out of the
internet rat race.
</p>

<p>
It will be hard. I know because I&rsquo;ve tried and failed many times
before. Internet-screen addiction is a very insidious, and going off
this constantly connected state leaves me feeling&#x2014;detached, adrift,
lost, depressed, anxious, without purpose or meaning. But I know that
I&rsquo;m only getting fake fulfillment from being online, that whomever I
imagine myself engaging with is complete illusion. Who&rsquo;s to say we are
not at some ChatGPT juncture where some chatbot is pretending to be my
advocate, friend, supporter&#x2014;as in the frightening film <i>Her</i>?
</p>

<p>
I once thought I&rsquo;d really do this whole project up, i.e., not just
internet detox, but do a sort of &ldquo;historical reenactment theater&rdquo;
where I would pretend to be a German nobleman (in period costume) come
to the American wilds for to gather observations, a la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville">Alexis de
Tocqueville</a>. No, just getting offline will be a good beginning.
</p>

<p>
I also thought that once I got this Wuthering.UK site up I&rsquo;d launch a
total media blitz, anchored by a YouTube channel where I&rsquo;d do videos
after videos and get real famous and rich. But then I thought, Does
the world need another braying ass going on about how he knows better
than all the other braying asses? No. I&rsquo;ve come to a very big
realization in my life, namely, that I really don&rsquo;t know
anything. Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t been able to forgive/ignore those
around me who know even less; hence, a detox will help me work on this
last hurdle to absolute perfection.
