This has been a typical North Coast (NC) early Spring week (March
20&#x2014;26) of weather confusion. It was sunny and relatively mild,
hovering around 40 over the weekend, but then Tuesday the 22nd through
Wednesday the 23rd brought at least a foot of heavy, wet snow. Today,
we have again a mild and sunny day, last check 49 degrees! But again,
this is typical NC bait-and-switch, i.e., we can go right back to
<i>Half-Winter</i>, my term for the typical Spring up here where we bounce
between daily freezing temps up to the fifties.

I try to get down to the Harbour daily. Yesterday this was the East
Bay

John Keats&rsquo; character in the 2009 film <i>Bright Star</i> says
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving in
a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore, but to be in the lake,
to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not work the lake
out. It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and emboldens
the soul to accept mystery.

<p>
Right. The point is not to analyse each and every tree, but to
luxuriate in the realisation of the forest as a whole. Never before
did poetry reach so far into the whole, into the intuitive and
unexplainable as it did in the nineteenth century in the era of
<i>Romanticism</i>.

<p>
so it escapes the scientific scalpels and tweezers
of scholarly research. Basically, one reads&#x2026;and one
absorbs&#x2014;perhaps many times this cycle. And then the exercise part of
the process is over. No further left-brain analysis or dissection
necessary. No &ldquo;what does it really mean?&rdquo; No &ldquo;what was the context in
which&#x2026;&rdquo; No &ldquo;what were his sources of inspiration.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s take a look
at a poem from whom I consider one of the leading poets of the age,
she being Emily Jane Brontë, specifically, her <i>Fall leaves fall</i>
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br />
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br />
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br />
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br />
I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br />
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br />
I shall sing when night’s decay<br />
Ushers in a drearier day.<br />

</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is your first test. You either get it or you don&rsquo;t. No digging or
working out its meaning necessary.
