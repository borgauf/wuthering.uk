This has been a typical North Coast (NC) early Spring week of weather
confusion, sun one day, clouds the next. Though it has been very
low-ceiling misty-cloudy for the last few days. Today we have both
rain and sleet, with the Coop city parking lot partially flooded. As I
look up to the ridge, half is cloud-shrouded, with the very highest
parts frosted. This was yesterday&rsquo;s situation as well.
</p>

<p>
The harbor is medium visibility, clouds hanging low. Sleet
come-and-go. Winds are moderate. Not like yesterday&rsquo;s, the 5th, when a
very strong north-east wind ripped across the sea.

so it escapes the scientific scalpels and tweezers
of scholarly research. Basically, one reads&#x2026;and one
absorbs&#x2014;perhaps many times this cycle. And then the exercise part of
the process is over. No further left-brain analysis or dissection
necessary. No &ldquo;what does it really mean?&rdquo; No &ldquo;what was the context in
which&#x2026;&rdquo; No &ldquo;what were his sources of inspiration.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s take a look
at a poem from whom I consider one of the leading poets of the age,
she being Emily Jane Brontë, specifically, her <i>Fall leaves fall</i>
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br />
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br />
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br />
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br />
I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br />
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br />
I shall sing when night’s decay<br />
Ushers in a drearier day.<br />

</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is your first test. You either get it or you don&rsquo;t. No digging or
working out its meaning necessary.
