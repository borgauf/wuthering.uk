This has been a typical North Coast (NC) early Spring week (March
20&#x2014;26) of weather confusion. It was sunny and relatively mild,
hovering around 40 over the weekend, but then Tuesday the 22nd through
Wednesday the 23rd brought at least a foot of heavy, wet snow. Today,
we have again a mild and sunny day, last check 49 degrees! But again,
this is typical NC bait-and-switch, i.e., we can go right back to
<i>Half-Winter</i>, my term for the typical Spring up here where we bounce
between daily freezing temps up to the fifties.

I try to get down to the Harbour daily. Yesterday this was the East

so it escapes the scientific scalpels and tweezers
of scholarly research. Basically, one reads&#x2026;and one
absorbs&#x2014;perhaps many times this cycle. And then the exercise part of
the process is over. No further left-brain analysis or dissection
necessary. No &ldquo;what does it really mean?&rdquo; No &ldquo;what was the context in
which&#x2026;&rdquo; No &ldquo;what were his sources of inspiration.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s take a look
at a poem from whom I consider one of the leading poets of the age,
she being Emily Jane Brontë, specifically, her <i>Fall leaves fall</i>
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br />
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br />
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br />
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br />
I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br />
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br />
I shall sing when night’s decay<br />
Ushers in a drearier day.<br />

</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is your first test. You either get it or you don&rsquo;t. No digging or
working out its meaning necessary.
