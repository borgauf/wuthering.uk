Light snow drifts gently down from low clouds draped over a
misty boreal forest. Deer in their grey winter coats process through
the fir and spruce. Ravens and crows dolefully croak and caw back and
forth. And I burn a daytime candle. Such an ambience to convey my
thoughts, my impressions and <i>feelings</i> about my <i>Dark Muse</i>.<label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.7849163' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.7849163' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
<i>muse</i>: Originally any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts; <i>or</i> a state of
deep thought or abstraction, e.g., to enter a <i>muse</i> over a poem; <i>or</i>
a source of inspiration, e.g., <i>Jane Austen is my muse</i>.

Do you have an inexplicable fascination with things on the gloomy
side? You routinely find <i>dreamy</i> what others find <i>dreary</i> &#x2026; like
when an overcast day brings on a strangely sanguine melancholy &#x2026; or
a stormy night is magnificent in a frightening and thrilling sort of
way. Twilight is a welcome reprieve from the hectic, incessant day,
freeing your senses, calming, deepening your thoughts. you&rsquo;ve often
paused to gaze transfixed upon a lonely, nondescript landscape, a
wild, deserted shore, an old, abandoned cemetery. Just like a
decaying, overgrown, other-century structure makes you envious of the
bats living there. Unnatural is having to get out of heat into air
conditioning and drink iced beverages; much better to come inside out
of the cold and sit by a fire and drink hot tea. Time and again what
they find uplifting is piteously trite out to ruefully disappointing
for you. Panic and nausea typically well up when attempts are made at
sunny-cheery; then being alone is a necessity and not always
lonely. Their heroes grasp desperately at happy endings. Yours learn
and grow from facing grim and harsh&#x2014;and if it means succumbing to
the thrashing, amen, RIP,<label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.3277734' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.3277734' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., Lady Dedlock&rsquo;s death at the graveyard of her secret
lover in Dickens&rsquo; <i>Bleak House</i>.
</span> c&rsquo;est la vie, time for mourning
black. Candlelight over artificial light, wool over nylon, old
architecture over new, the genial disorder of wild nature over the
forced order of gardens. If in a city, you can&rsquo;t stand anywhere but
the oldest quarters and big, old parks. What is spectacular to them is
suspect and eventually disappointing to you &#x2026; whereas things subtle,
veiled, shadowy tenuous, understated are intriguing. Stirrings,
please, but not shaking or slamming&#x2026; And yes, it might seem a bit to
ask, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be grand if every month we celebrated Halloween?
If yes to any of this, you might understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say
here.
</p>

<p>
I provide here a quote from Charlotte Brontë&rsquo;s <i>Jane Eyre An
Autobiography</i>. Main protagonist Jane describes the house, called
simply Moor House, and environs of her adoptive family, the Rivers, on
the edge of the wild moors,<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.6293918' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.6293918' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
The word <i>moor</i> appears forty-three times in <i>Jane Eyre</i>. After
the second or third use, I was just putty in Charlotte&rsquo;s hands&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
They loved their sequestered home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique
structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering
walls, its avenue of aged firs&#x2014;all grown aslant under the stress of
mountain winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly&#x2014;and where no
flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom&#x2014;found a charm both
potent and permanent. They clung to the purple moors behind and around
their dwelling&#x2014;to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path
leading from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks
first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields
that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a
flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced
lambs&#x2014;they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of
attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
and sweep&#x2014;on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by
moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,
and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were
to them&#x2014;so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast
and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of
sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for
me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them&#x2014;wound round my
faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#x2026; <i>the consecration of its loneliness</i> indeed.<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.9790334' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.9790334' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
Here is what I might call an <i>English Zen</i>. More about EZ later.
</span> I often read
this passage just to muse upon the wistful, moody, delicately
melancholic intentionally anti-spectacular subtleties she
describes&#x2014;and how this and other choice moments set the whole tone
and mood of the book. Charlotte Brontë establishes light and dark as
equals, and then works expertly with the gradient there between. The
dim, the shadows, the dark, the harsh, even at times merciless
inclemencies are features not bugs. She does not suppress dark,
perhaps knowing that if it is seen an equal to light it will
eventually prove itself the older, wiser sibling capable of rich,
complimentary contributions. A notable gradient boon is how she has
the Moor House environs so very abandoned, lonely, thus ultra-wild
exactly because they are so unpresuming and overlooked, so bereft of
anything nature-spectacular&#x2014;as opposed to some breathtaking
primordial wilderness millions of miles away visited only by intrepid
explorers. Indeed, subtle and unassuming become the older, wiser
siblings of grand and spectacular. Notable too how Jane arrived at
Moor House&#x2014;half dead on her hands and knees, thus, completely
vulnerable. And recovered, she is still every bit the underdog
relative to a modern developed world citizen. This point is key to
what I&rsquo;ll say later&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Case in point: Consider the Great Smoky Mountains National Park high
on the Appalachian Mountains border of the American states Tennessee
and North Carolina. The <i>Smokies</i> are a federally protected,
quasi-pristine wilderness of 522,419 acres, surrounded by
lesser-protected though still completely wilderness USDA National
Forest land totalling over a million acres. The actual national park
is visited by over fourteen million tourists per year, with additional
tourist attractions and accommodations all around the park
boundaries.<label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.2856921' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.2856921' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
Ironically, only a small fraction of these visitors are
actually out on the park&rsquo;s extensive wilderness trails hiking and
camping. Most are either driving the main dissecting highway
connecting Tennessee to North Carolina or simply crowding into the
visitor centres per automobile. I once visited on the Fourth of July,
stopping in bordering Gatlinburg where the downtown sidewalks
standing-room-only. But later that same day I hiked for hours on the
main Appalachian Trail and saw not another human&#x2026;
</span> Ironic as it may seem, I say Jane&rsquo;s Yorkshire
moorlands are Nature, while the Smokies cannot be in the abstraction,
the artificiality of their purpose, not to mention their publicity
throughout the entire world. The Smokies are fussed and ruled over by
armies of scientists and bureaucrats at the behest of the
U.S. Department of Interior National Park, UNESCO World Heritage Site,
International Biosphere Reserve, etc., like a great research terrarium
under an invisible glass dome. Even in the remotest, genuinely wild
spots, the weight of humanity&rsquo;s lurking dominance, our collective
mental presence is massive&#x2026; And so we have the dichotomy of
discovered and undiscovered, exotic versus vernacular, integrated
versus detached, grounded versus transient, many versus no matches to
googling. As the Rivers&rsquo; guest, Jane describes a natural and organic
connection to her moorland, while no modern tourist can ever expect to
be truly integrated with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park
complex.<label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.572549' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.572549' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
Perhaps give the Smokies a second chance by reading the
pre-park fictional work <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_(novel)">Christy</a></i> by Catherine Marshall.
</span> Lots more on what Nature really means to us later&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Continuing, I am at a loss to explain my dark <i>penchant</i> to those who
do not, cannot, will not get it. Dark as I mean it is strictly a
take-it-or-leave-it proposition; one gets Dark or one does not. Dark
as I mean it was best presented by certain principle <b>poets</b> of the
early nineteenth-century Romantic Era,<label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.4993595' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.4993595' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
Quick preliminary, much more later: The term Romanticism
followed a twisted path beginning with the Latin <i>romant</i>, or, &ldquo;in the
Roman manner&rdquo;, thus, not at all our current use of the word as a
synonym of love. In general, bundling what I&rsquo;m trying to get at as
<i>Romanticism</i> is fraught to say the least. Academe wants to grip
butterflies, but when they open their hands there is only goo. Lots
more on this problem as we go&#x2026;
</span> an <i>emergent</i> property, a
very special private corner of this ultimately maligned and
misunderstood time. To be sure, best expressed is the Dark Muse in
poetry. I, as well as many others of yore, believe that lyrical poetry
captures far more and drives far deeper than whatever can be lined up
in long chains of prose sentences. For example, it is almost as if
principal poetess Emily Dickinson used words to mercilessly exploit
just how tenuous words really are. She routinely made words give up
their ghosts just to swap in even more mysterious ghosts. We&rsquo;ll
explore some of her wicked flights into thoughts behind thoughts as we
go. When you read my Amherst Emily haiku-like lines, think of Zen
koans for the Dark Muse.
</p>

<p>
I can only say my Dark Muse often comes on as a <i>feeling behind
feeling</i>, subtle, profound, yet fleeting, not hanging around for
pedantics&rsquo; tedious descriptions.<label id='fnr.8' for='fnr-in.8.1716693' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.8.1716693' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup>
One very important principal, the German poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novalis">Novalis</a> (penname
for Baron Friedrich von Hardenberg), often used his unique <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_fragment">fragment</a></i>
style to describe his Dark Muse. And so he abandoned even lyrical
poetry to get even more bursty, more spontaneous in order to capture
the subtleties of his impressions. Lots more about Novalis, the
presumed founder of German Romanticism, as we go along.
</span> Dark stirrings arrive mostly
unannounced, a veritable surprise. Dark is a gift for which one says
thank you and doesn&rsquo;t immediately Google Lens to see how much it
cost. Thus, my exploration of Dark will rely heavily on the poetry of
the preeminent Romantic Era champions of Dark Muse.

Allow me German noun capitalisation for poetic emphasis.
</span>, but for whatever reasons only want to
express it, explore it very narrowly through goth music and
fashion. My Dark Muse would hopefully include, be akin to what is
today called goth and gothic, <i>but I must go deeper and more
elemental</i>. I hope you allow me to speak to your &ldquo;inner goth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There is a <i>natural darkness</i> that Nature provides, a basis upon which
we may create symbols, artefacts, icons, trappings to emulate,
decorate, magnify, socialise, humanise, if nothing else, <i>bring
indoors</i> natural Dark. Yes to aesthetics as far as they may resonate,
do honour to Dark. But too often our human take on Dark winds up
overstated, overwrought&#x2014;all the way out to grimy, ignoble, silly,
scummy. We imbibe then express what we see, experience, feel. But it
must be done carefully, if not respectfully. And so I must reject so
many of the overdone <i>gothic</i> horror fright memes, e.g., vampires,
witches, demons; mean nasty menacing this, campy threatening evil
that. Right up front: My Dark is not meant to shock or frighten,
rather, invite, deepen, and enrich. My Dark Muse contains nothing
cruel nor evil nor sinister nor satanic<label id='fnr.11' for='fnr-in.11.8061131' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.11.8061131' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup>
As philosopher and psychologist John Vervaeke said in
describing the modern crisis of anxiety and dysphoria, &ldquo;Horror is the
<i>aesthetic</i> of when you feel like you&rsquo;re losing your grip on reality.&rdquo;
Nothing to gain with horror memes. Not going there&#x2026;
</span>. Mine is not the <i>Star
Wars</i> &ldquo;dark side,&rdquo; not dark barbarism à la <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, and
not the psychic dark described by Freud or Jung. I cringe when someone
says, &ldquo;&#x2026;and then things took a <i>dark</i> turn.&rdquo; In general
</p>

\begin{align*}
\large{\text{Dark} \ne \text{negative}}
\end{align*}

<p>
Of course camp, over-the-top can be interesting, fun, but I&rsquo;d rather
not lose sight of the source, however obscure and difficult. I&rsquo;m after
something more subtle, discriminating, and inward-personal. Sort of
like the small natural sweet of a wild strawberry versus the chemical
sweet blast of saccharine. Natural versus manufactured. <b>My Dark is
about the sublime</b> &#x2026; indeed, <i>sublimity</i>. I will eventually deal
with Edmund Burke&rsquo;s (as well as Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s) false, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t
get it at all&rdquo; tedium on <i>sublimity</i> later. In the meantime, <i>sublime</i>
is basically what we may find beyond mere beauty, touching what
Dostoevsky is saying here
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are seconds, they only come five or six at a time, and you
suddenly feel the <b>presence of eternal harmony</b> (POEH) fully
achieved. It is nothing earthly; not that it is heavenly, but man
cannot endure it in his earthly state. One must change physically or
die. The feeling is clear and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense
the whole of nature and suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not
tenderheartedness, but simply joy.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#x2026;perhaps awe instead of joy? Again, much more fleshing out as we go
along&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
And so I hearken back to a golden era when Dark was the cultural
currency, to be sure, the early nineteenth century, a time when my key
poets, my <i>principals</i> (e.g. Poe, Novalis, the Brontës) showed us how
triste and Stygian can be so very subtle and sublime. I&rsquo;m after
something <i>I will not outgrow</i>, rather, continue as my raison d&rsquo;être
sustaining me to my grave. And so I say there must be no &ldquo;aging out of
the scene&rdquo; as I fear often happens with modern goth.<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.6442931' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.6442931' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>
Why do people age out of goth? A crude answer may be they just
can&rsquo;t kick the rebel chic can down the beach any longer &#x2026; there, I
said it&#x2026;
</span> Rather, the Dark
Muse should be a deepening and widening and transcendence for one&rsquo;s
entire life.

Another ox gored is my rejection of modern dumbed-down American street
English, which has permeated modern society virtually
worldwide. Basically, I mean to sound more erudite, sophisticated,
intellectual with my use of past-century British-tinted English. Why?
Simply because the English of the early-nineteenth century was like a
thoroughbred race horse, sleek and powerful, capable of amazingly deep
and magical expression. Contrast this with beggared, destitute,
impoverished, needlessly retrenched modern American street English,
which requires a buy-in to a particularly base, ignorant, crude and
aggressive hipster Zeitgeist. Which I repudiate, not going
there. Although I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll occasionally slip up.<label id='fnr.13' for='fnr-in.13.9214321' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.13.9214321' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup>
Retrenchment towards what, exactly? Orwell&rsquo;s <i>1984</i>? Really&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, people were more genteel, thoughtful,
fine-spoken. Indeed, back when having character and honour, when
showing decorum and graciousness was a way of life. As a result, their
poetry could express the depths and heights of human thought and
sensitivities so much better.<label id='fnr.14' for='fnr-in.14.1471703' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.14.1471703' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup>
&#x2026;while so much of our modern poetry is screed doggerel. For
example, Allen Ginsberg acclaimed <i>Howl</i> is really social-political
pamphleteering in verse, not true poetry as it has been known for
centuries. And from there things go downhill fast&#x2014;into the most
ridiculous absurdist nihilist nonsense.
</span> In past centuries they understood
the human need for holiness, grandeur, the epic and eternal. Compare
this with the crypto-rebel posers we see everywhere today who believe
being coarse, crass, base, irreverent&#x2014;and arrogantly in-your-face
about it&#x2014;is somehow progressive and desirable&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But on the other hand, it might just be that I&rsquo;ve finally succumbed to
the influence of all those schoolmarms back in my distant 1950s-60s
childhood who made us read, e.g., Shakespeare and Hawthorn, those
nearing-retirement throw-backs who held up &ldquo;wordy,&rdquo; other-century
English as superior. Mrs Mugwortlawny was right, you know. And yes,
I&rsquo;ll occasionally drop foreign as well as Latin words and phrases, my
foreign language being German. You have been warned&#x2026;

dark, namely, Emily Jane Brontë<label id='fnr.16' for='fnr-in.16.2061938' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.16.2061938' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup>
Oddly enough, I&rsquo;ve never read her <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and do
not intend to. (More about why later.) Basically, it would be like
watching Marian Anderson sing a bawdy sailor&rsquo;s song. However, her
poetry I read continually, discovering new things, gleaning deeper
insights each time. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB">here</a> for a quick biography.  <br>

Here EB is direct, blunt even. But now we know. Either she speaks to
something in you, or you are part of the majority who finds
it&#x2014;weird, abnormal, morbid, overwrought, puerile, even sick or
evil. To be sure, my dark <i>penchant</i> gets mostly deer-in-headlights
responses, if not outright hostility. The openly hostile see my dark
druthers as morose, morbid, as wallowing in self-pity, dwelling on the
negative, in need of a quick DSM–5 look-up.<label id='fnr.17' for='fnr-in.17.8196407' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.17.8196407' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup>

Rossetti exposits a dark fatalism, ending with hope bound in humble
expectancy. I like to think these two English poetesses are expressing
an informed, matured melancholy that bespeaks a deeper understanding
of life.

Yes, poems, as the Dark Muse seems to find its best, most
concentrated expression through poetry. Much more on why mainly poetry
delivers the ineffable of darkness later.

Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow">here</a> for a quick biography. HWL was not typically Dark,
rather, a popular, &ldquo;uplifting&rdquo; poet with a big audience. That&rsquo;s what
makes this selection so unique for me.
</span> looking to the natural world and
<i>poetising</i>, to be sure, <i>darkly</i>. The idea of poetising, the
<i>poetisation</i> of nature and life was central to the Romantic
Movement.<label id='fnr.21' for='fnr-in.21.7408686' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.21.7408686' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup>
Below we will go over poetising&rsquo;s originator, Novalis.
</span> It parallels the long-standing belief that we humans
explain ourselves through, embed our lives in narratives. In olden
times nature was the stage. And so agents, triggers of mental
affliction and depression&#x2014;despair, grief, misery&#x2014;are transformed
into more equanimous states of sadness and melancholy, hopefully
bringing us to a higher emotional maturity.<label id='fnr.22' for='fnr-in.22.9115149' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.22.9115149' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup>
Events in life, especially hardships, are supposed to
<i>increase</i> our emotional depth and maturity, not become excuses for
emotional immaturity as we so often see today.
</span> In some paradoxical
way, nature and darkness eventually become healers &#x2026; as if the
initial agony and sorrow are a ravaging cancer or virus that
eventually fades into remission, but can never entirely be eliminated
whilst on Earth. And so being <i>mortal</i> was wholly different back then.
</p>

<p>
This <i>poetising</i> of Nature dark and mystical was the modus operandi of
my select nineteenth-century poets. Rather than avoid, they
encountered, even <i>embraced</i> Dark, something we today in our
brightly-lit, cordoned-off world might consider counter-productive, if
not wrong-headed. I contend we have lost this subtle art of moving
hardship, tragedy, emotional crises into a stasis remission
melancholy. Too often we are failures at finding a <i>modus
vivendi</i><label id='fnr.23' for='fnr-in.23.362816' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.23.362816' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup>
<i>modus vivendi</i>: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, <i>or</i> (literally) a way of living.
</span> vis-à-vis the trials and tribulations of life as our
ancestors once did.
</p>

<p>
Surely the human suffers poorly. Again, all we may ever do is usher
the initially searing, inescapable pain to a dull ache in the backdrop
of time. Though again I would say this was better conducted in the
past than today. They did not attempt to contain, disguise,
systematise, nor <i>process</i> greif; rather, greif was faced directly,
pain was shared, empathy a way of communal life. And so emotional
space was allotted, support was shared, organic, and
natural. Strikingly different from today was their acceptance of
<i>doom</i><label id='fnr.24' for='fnr-in.24.9956131' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.24.9956131' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup>
Doom as unforeseen consequences of previous actions, which in
turn, entropically snowball into indebtedness, tragedy, and ruin;
typically multi-generational, a punishment that never seems to fit the
original crime&#x2014;if it was a crime at all. The German word for doom is
<i>Untergang</i>, which also means <i>downfall</i>.
</span> and fate, two concepts antithetical to our dynamic,
positivist, self-determining, fix-everything-quickly,
cover-up-the-sticky-bits modern attitudes.
</p>

Consider Queen Victoria<label id='fnr.25' for='fnr-in.25.2535754' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.25.2535754' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup>

</span> who wore mourning black from the time
of her husband Prince Albert&rsquo;s death in 1861 till the end of her life
in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg who upon losing her husband
Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. In those days death was properly, officially mourned. No one
dared chivvy mourners along with their grief and sadness. Contrast
this with today&rsquo;s all-too-prevalent disassociation, the confused
emotional shutdown, the disorganised quasi-denial and suppression we
moderns too often show towards death<label id='fnr.26' for='fnr-in.26.1650310' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.26.1650310' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup>
Is there anything worse than the so-called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief">five stages of
grief</a></i> or the Kübler-Ross model? Grief as an emotional malfunction
to be systematically reduced, fixed, corrected? Alas.
</span>. For the early nineteenth
century, poetising life&rsquo;s train of tragedy was <i>depression
deconstruction</i> as a life skill. The slings and arrows of human
existence found conjunction with <i>Nature</i>, <i>Dark</i>, and <i>Faith</i> through
poetry, thereby highlighting, elevating our uniquely human experience
on Earth, <b>casting a gossamer of sublimity over our natural existence
like no other generation before or since</b>. Theirs was the deepest
exploration of our true humanness that I know, and, thus, something I
must pursue and showcase here.

<p>
But still, why Dark? Dark speaks to me. But again, how, why? Lack of a
clear and simple answer forces me into a regrettably wordier one?
Dark remains mysterious&#x2014;no matter how I try to imbibe or express
it. Dark is something instinctual, cathartic, evocative, centring for
me. Dark is more than the lack of light. Dark can lead the imagination
to riot. The moss, lichens, and mushrooms in the secretive shadows of
the forest incite so much more than the spectacular sunny vista across
the forest valley. The fresh-cut rose elicits a simple response, but
the faded rose another&#x2014;deeper, but for me never dysphoric. Here is

<blockquote>
<p>
The new cut rose: Initially beautiful, thereafter dried and
desiccated, lost forever its initial delicate beauty and
fragrance. Once affording a glimpse of perfection, only reminiscent
thereafter. Beauty always some fleeting illusion or madness? Moreover
its eclipse, joining, leading the shadows of our relentless doom, our
march to the grave. And though I live in this momentary brilliance, I
still search my night shore; for until now I have known only of
beauty’s haunting rumour, of love’s promise, those slightest
quickenings of things necessarily rare and formerly peripheral. Yes,
in this moment I may have some of love’s bliss, but I know I will
cherish with a larger, more mature heart the memory thereof, an echo
sent down life’s long, clouded memory hall as the true and lasting
blessing.

Again, Dickinson often employed the capitalising of nouns for
poetic emphasis.
</span> Again, I must emphasise these nineteenth-century
artists understood human mortality much differently than we do
today. Unfortunately, this past-century view of Death has become
opaque, lost. I hope to rediscover it. I&rsquo;ll start by positing their
understanding of Death was integral to their understanding of

</span> and their
contemporaries. Alone the fact that our typical indoor living
environments today are more like modular, sealed <i>space stations</i>
plopped down on a hostile alien planet compared to the simpler, more
primitive structures of the not-so-distant past. Quite literally, the
Brontës&rsquo; Haworth parsonage, built in 1778 out of local stone and wood
and clay, had more in common with human shelters from one, <i>two</i>
thousand years previous than with our modern suburban homes only some
two hundred years later<label id='fnr.32' for='fnr-in.32.8791831' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>32</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.32.8791831' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>32</sup>

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
in just the past two to three hundred years a very steep, vertical
gradient or differential has grown between indoors and outdoors.

<p>
This, in turn, has brought us to see nature more as a <i>place</i> separate
and outside, cut off, away from our artificial, high-tech, controlled
and regulated modern indoor spaces<label id='fnr.33' for='fnr-in.33.6439167' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>33</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.33.6439167' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>33</sup>
Is it not ironic how nearly all lifeforms that attempt to
share our human environments uninvited are considered invasive,
noxious vermin, pests to which we have developed almost hysterical
revulsion?
</span> &#x2026; which, in turn, has lead
us to rate <i>outdoors nature</i> on continua of relative wildness and
remoteness from our sealed-off, self-contained, humans-only
environments.

<p>
Even as late as my own childhood the term <i>homespun</i> was in use to
indicate a poor, unsophisticated person, a country bumkin, a hick from
the sticks. The term referred to a person&rsquo;s clothing being homemade
from locally-sourced, hand-spun and woven materials such as linen and
wool rather than factory-made retail clothing. The early-nineteenth
century Brontëan West Yorkshire would have seen the majority of the
villagers in homespun, all but a few garments not hand-tailored
bespoke.<label id='fnr.34' for='fnr-in.34.7675764' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.34.7675764' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup>
However cotton was rapidly becoming a global commodity, both
cotton and wool fabrics eventually being produced in steam-powered
factories as the Industrial Age reached its inflexion point of growth.
</span> And of course food was entirely from local
production. Hence, a person&rsquo;s daily resources were overwhelmingly
local, a small bit perhaps coming from a nearby <i>market town</i>, while
only the most exotic items (e.g., a clock) would have come from
farther away. Today, however, this supply pyramid is completely
flipped, as nearly everything comes from far (far!) away (e.g. China),
while only a few personal items would be from a local or even regional
source.<label id='fnr.35' for='fnr-in.35.8811130' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.35.8811130' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup>
In any modern (non-organic Amazon Whole Foods-style)
supermarket I&rsquo;m sure less that 1% of the food items come from a truly
local source. Nearly everything is shipped in from often far afar.
</span> And so in Brontëan times (first half of the 1800s) the
surrounding land was agriculturally domesticated, a working
partner. Contrast this with today&rsquo;s urban-suburban populations hardly
ever in contact with farmers or their farms. Nor do we know anything
about where our clothing came from. Today, nature as &ldquo;the land,&rdquo; as
our immediate provider, has been completely abstracted into concepts
such as <i>ecosystems</i>, which implies we are now removed observers
controlling nature as if it were just another of our mechanical
objects.
</p>

<p>
No doubt we have always made a distinction between being <i>inside</i> a
shelter and going <i>outside</i> into the so-called <i>elements</i>. But
starting some six to ten thousand years ago we began to give up
aboriginal nomadic life and its direct daily contact with said
untamed, uncontrolled elements in order to establish permanent
city-states supported by mass monoculture agriculture. And so indoor
environments in ever-expanding urban centres became evermore
physically removed, walled off from the wild natural world, becoming
increasingly self-contained, all-encompassing, self-referencing, thus,
<i>recursively derivative</i>.<label id='fnr.36' for='fnr-in.36.3919073' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.36.3919073' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., what is a flower garden but a derivative, a mock-up
of an original place out in the wilds, albeit with the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits left, weeded out?
</span>
</p>

<p>
Along with this growing separation came mentalities, narratives
increasingly based indoors and <i>extra-natural</i>.<label id='fnr.37' for='fnr-in.37.7474389' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.37.7474389' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup>
How often is a Shakespeare character out communing with
nature? Never?&#x2026;
</span> Being indoors
meant we no longer were in direct contact with the nature spirits all
around; instead, praying to an extra-natural, off-world monotheistic
God in architectural showcase churches<label id='fnr.38' for='fnr-in.38.8006679' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.38.8006679' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup>
Churches were typically built in the centre of a town or city
on the highest ground. I once heard that to this day no building in
Vienna may be built taller than the tower of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Cathedral.
</span>. Western architecture
seemed to reach a fantastical aesthetic crescendo in the Victorian
nineteenth century<label id='fnr.39' for='fnr-in.39.2219476' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.39.2219476' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup>
&#x2026;with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as a leading
style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
&ldquo;revivalist-nostalgic&rdquo; (Greek, Gothic, Italianate, Elizabethan, Queen
Anne, etc.), perhaps a hearkening back to times more integrated with
nature, with shallower gradients between indoors and outdoors?
</span>, coinciding with an exponential growth in
urban population which had just passed an inflection point. Today the
steepness of our indoor-outdoor gradient has increased even more since
Victorian times &#x2026; resulting in a humanity more abstracted
<i>extra-natural</i> than ever. How then may we, a species seemingly
capable of great adaptability,<label id='fnr.40' for='fnr-in.40.3691904' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>40</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.40.3691904' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>40</sup>
Adaptability leading to, A) a permanent (beneficial)
alteration, or B) a temporary adjustment, allowance for
less-that-optimal conditions, supposing an eventual return to optimal
conditions. We humans, I contend, are B-adaptable. This means we are
certainly no barometer species or &ldquo;canary in the coal mine&rdquo; of our own
well-being. We routinely ignore our fellow canary-like humans,
allowing them to suffer and die, their warnings unheeded.
</span> objectively measure our
separation from nature?  What has domestic, urban, indoor living done
to our brains, our sense of belonging to the planet, to one another?
How can we even begin to trace back the many rabbit hole bifurcations,
the chain of derivatives we&rsquo;ve taken for all these centuries down,
out, and away from <i>nature pure</i>?  To be sure, we have demonstrated a
collective will to make conditions better for us <i>and us alone</i>. We

concerned over the question of sustainability, concerned about our
long arc of estrangement from nature.<label id='fnr.43' for='fnr-in.43.6487660' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>43</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.43.6487660' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>43</sup>
Is our relatively gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling frog</a> metaphor?
</span> Let me suggest a
completely different understanding of nature, namely&#x2014;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Nature is not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature is everything going on everywhere. Nature as the myriad cycles
of <b>birth</b>, <b>growth</b>, <b>deterioration</b>, and <b>death</b> happening
everywhere all the time.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, knew,
sensed this pre-modern meaning of nature as beyond inside or
outside. Yes, one went outside, out into the elements. But once back
indoors, a Brontë was not so completely out of and above nature&rsquo;s
touch, influence, <i>doom</i> as we now fancy ourselves. Again, the cycles
of birth, growth, deterioration, and death were happening everywhere
<i>sans emplacement</i>. Consider how the Industrial Revolution created
urban production landscapes vast and barren and completely outside of
any sort of nature, spatial or otherwise&#x2014;indeed, William Blake&rsquo;s
&ldquo;satanic mills.&rdquo; Here is what Ludwig Klages in the late-1800s said
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The face of the mainland has become a landscape of coerced
&ldquo;Chicago-ifications&rdquo; as humanity has fallen into an orgy of destruction
without precedence. So-called civilization wears the face of an
unleashed murderer, while the fullness, the bounty of the earth has
withered from his poisonous breath.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This was a change on a scale never before seen, a huge and relatively
sudden step away from the physical world being solely the purveyance
of nature. And so even when the individual left his house he was still
deep within a massive concentration of extra-natural, human-exclusive
space and activity. Poverty in the pre-industrial rural landscape was
all but idyllic compared the grueling, grinding poverty of the
industrial cityscapes.<label id='fnr.44' for='fnr-in.44.4666375' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>44</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.44.4666375' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>44</sup>
What became of Wordsworth&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45560/to-a-highland-girl">To a Highland Girl</a></i> shepherdess
when she and her family were forced into an industrial urban slum? We
can only hope she and her kin are in a better place now&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<p>
Here again is Emily Brontë from her poem <i>Shall earth no more inspire
thee</i> where Mother Nature speaks directly to the wayward human
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;<br>
Thy mind is ever moving<br>
In regions dark to thee;<br>
Recall its useless roving—<br>
Come back and dwell with me.<br>
&#x2026;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I can&rsquo;t read this poem without having a very emotional
response. Indeed, the house of mirrors echo chamber that modern life
has become precludes any real adaptation. And so the choice is simple:
We can go back to nature or continue our useless roving, which can
only lead to evermore mental crisis and catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
To be sure, so much ominous and doomsday has been said about mass
society in this modern industrialised world—all pointing to the
increasingly obvious fact that our vaunted adaptation skills are being
stretched to the breaking point, dysphoria, as well as ecological
collapse inevitable.
</p>

<p>
And again Emily Brontë, her epic <i>The night is darkening round me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The night is darkening round me,<br>
The wild winds coldly blow;<br>
But a tyrant spell has bound me,<br>
And I cannot, cannot go.<br>
<br>
The giant trees are bending<br>
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;<br>
The storm is fast descending,<br>
And yet I cannot go.<br>
<br>
Clouds beyond clouds above me,<br>
Wastes beyond wastes below;<br>
But nothing drear can move me;<br>
I will not, cannot go.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Yes, she is outdoors &ldquo;facing the elements,&rdquo; as we say. She even refers
to the wilds as &ldquo;wastes&rdquo; and as &ldquo;drear.&rdquo;<label id='fnr.45' for='fnr-in.45.600043' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>45</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.45.600043' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>45</sup>
In those days wild, untouched places were often referred to as
wastelands.
</span> And yet she is
transfixed, frozen to the spot&#x2014;and I cannot, cannot go, as she
says. Subjective terms like wastes and drear refer to the age-old
attitude towards nature as a terrible, grim, inescapable master, a
sponsor of disaster and death, hardly over which to linger, let alone
wax poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that, and to be sure,
grandeur and sublimity expressed in lines of verse was the surprising
result. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared directly at
an enemy previously known as all-powerful and unforgiving, and in so
doing she sensed something deep and personally transformative. She was
stirred to write lines that, for me at least, are the very centre of
the mystery of life, death, and the Dark Muse.
</p>

<p>
Now, contrast Brontëan nature with Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s
twentieth-century nature. Hemingway went hither and yon, all over the
globe to do his macho outdoors thing. But if anything serious had
happened to him he could have been airlifted out to receive modern
medical care. Not the Romantic Era poets who were in harm&rsquo;s way with
no timeouts, no escape. Would Hemingway have done all those macho-man
things if there had been no modern world with modern medical aid just
a plane ride away? Haworth Emily lived in a time when <i>nothing</i> was
modern, i.e., her West Yorkshire moorlands were semi-wilderness and
early eighteenth-century medicine didn&rsquo;t even know about germs.<label id='fnr.46' for='fnr-in.46.2765996' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>46</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.46.2765996' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>46</sup>
What is generally acknowledged as a clear breakthrough was
John Snow&rsquo;s tracing of the London cholera outbreak of 1854 back to
certain London neighborhood publich wells. This was strong proof of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease">contagion theory</a>. However, it wasn&rsquo;t until the late nineteenth
century that Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur established the field of
bacteriology and our modern scientific understanding of microscopic
pathogens developed.
</span>
Literally, a cut on a toe could become infected resulting in death.
</p>

<p>
With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around, the last two components, deterioration and
death, must be understood beyond our mechanistic reductionist modern
take of just physical malfunction.<label id='fnr.47' for='fnr-in.47.1803119' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>47</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.47.1803119' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>47</sup>
Couple this mechanistic &ldquo;death as malfunction&rdquo; with atheist
nihilism to arrive at a completely soulless mechanical universe
realism dumpster fire.
</span> Back in the day, death was a
<i>force majeure</i>, but no longer thanks to modern medicine. It&rsquo;s almost
as if deterioration and death, two of nature&rsquo;s supposedly inescapable
realities, have been cordoned off&#x2014;or at least placed under much
greater human control than ever before. <i>It&rsquo;s as if through modern
medicine we have begun to acquire a demi-godlike, proto-immortal veto
power over physical demise.</i> And with this control we have torn down,
dismantled a great component of spirituality, namely the reckoning of
one&rsquo;s mortality with a deity. Where once was supposed a <i>mortal</i>,
physical plane inferior an <i>immortal</i> spiritual plane, we now would
believe only the physical plane to be relevant. And with this comes a
great psychic and spiritual impoverishment, the extent of which we
cannot fully know.
</p>

<p>
Though for the meantime death remains an undeniable certainty. Death
comes as it always has&#x2014;from old age, fatal accident, or deadly
physical aggression or predation.<label id='fnr.48' for='fnr-in.48.5679331' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>48</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.48.5679331' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>48</sup>
For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are&#x2014;outside of war and homicidal aggression&#x2014;all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.
</span> But a completely different
attitude arises when modern healthcare&rsquo;s labyrinth of diagnoses,
drugs, procedures and surgeries routinely thwart what was once all but
certain, as well as swift demise. And so we&rsquo;ve begun to lessen the
mystery of Death, overturn fate, consequence, and doom.
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<br>
&#x2014; Psalm 90:10<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalistic,
absolute inevitability so resounding as to constantly shake and echo
through life. Death as life&rsquo;s backstop, container, timer, combinator,
reaper.<label id='fnr.49' for='fnr-in.49.4390980' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.49.4390980' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup>
Consider <a href="https://youtu.be/SMNGhPgCKzw?si=L4HFHQuUTnP3j8I6">this quite tolerable goth version</a> of the classic rock
song. Had this been written in Brontëan times, it would have been no
cheap, sentimental gimmick.
</span> And so I say, as death is interrupted, so are the
greater human cycles of emotion and spirituality interrupted.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, what if we start to take command of Death&rsquo;s appointment book,
rerouting, rescheduling Death&rsquo;s comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is
making the point that by no means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty
years of life, and even if we get them they might not be that
great. And yet we have grown to <i>expect</i> from the implicit promises of
modern medical science a healthy, high-quality seventy, eighty,
ninety, or even more years. Again, modern medicine has disrupted the
two last components of a nature ubiquitous cyclic, i.e., deterioration
and death, thereby further collapsing our understanding of what true
nature is. Modern science has lessened the wallop of tragedy, weakened
overall the doominess of doom by redefining life as so much organic
machine circuitry, a mechanism that, in turn, is to be better and
better repaired, maintained, improved against entropic
wear-and-tear<label id='fnr.50' for='fnr-in.50.8478366' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>50</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.50.8478366' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>50</sup>
Consider the commonplace heart pacemaker, a device that
literally overrides the human heart with artificial electronic pulses.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Let me relate a modern story about our new attitude towards death. My
father, who has since passed away, lost his <i>third</i> wife to lung
cancer caused inevitably by decades of smoking<label id='fnr.51' for='fnr-in.51.7457167' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>51</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.51.7457167' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>51</sup>
Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.
</span>. But instead of
accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I finally theorised that he
had explicated from all the buzz of the various possible medical
interventions&#x2014;including their probabilities of success or
failure&#x2014;a hope that the death sentence of lung cancer could,
<i>should</i> be beaten by some technology lurking in some corner of the
modern medical labyrinth. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed Death&rsquo;s arrival to
such an absurd degree. Human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of Death able to lap over at any time. But today
the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has become an all but
guaranteed minimum. Old age and death are increasingly spoken of as
&ldquo;diseases&rdquo; we can and should defeat. Death as a nuisance, indeed. My
father felt cheated when that three-, fourscore and more was not
forthcoming. But as you may anticipate, I contend life is life only
with Death&#x2014;Death absolute and not easily pushed back, much less
obviated.

<i>Magnificent Rebels, The First Romantics and the Invention of the

account in a section below.
</span> These thinkers rallied around Novalis, whom they
adopted as a sort of savant mascot, building on <i>HttN</i> and Novalis&rsquo;
<i>poetising</i>, another term he used for the romanticising of
life. Indeed, what came to be known as Jena Romanticism<label id='fnr.58' for='fnr-in.58.6902977' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>58</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.58.6902977' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>58</sup>

main purpose of WutheringUK is to wrest Romanticism and especially
Dark away from the ivory tower humanities technocrats.
</span> spread
to eager circles and fertile grounds throughout the West. They raised
Novalis&rsquo; idealisations of <i>Poesie</i> <label id='fnr.59' for='fnr-in.59.7972201' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>59</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.59.7972201' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>59</sup>
The German <i>Poesie</i> is typically translated as simply
<i>poetry</i>; however, poetry as a concept beyond just the literary art,
more towards the older <i>poesy</i> perhaps. And of course Novalis and the
Jena Set expanded even further&#x2026;
</span> as an all-embracing paradigm
to counter the cold, dehumanising, thus desensitising implications of
Enlightenment Age rationalism and determinism, as well as the
stultifying formalisms of Classicism. <b>Novalis sounded the charge to
<i>re-sensitise</i> life.</b> Lots more on this later&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Alas, but here is where I become quite the iconoclast, primarily by
insisting <i>academe has Romanticism wrong!</i> Even Novalis&rsquo; supporters,
his Jena contemporaries, yes, even Novalis himself seemed to lose the
thread and march about spouting dessicated
intellectualisations.<label id='fnr.60' for='fnr-in.60.5502932' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>60</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.60.5502932' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>60</sup>
If you must, read <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/novalis/">this about Novalis</a>, which is as good as
any. But as academe is wont to do, it hangs on every word uttered,
written by a young man feeling his way along in his twenties. This
approach may work with Einstein, but not a twenty-something poet&#x2026;
</span> I posit that Novalis with his
foundational <i>HttN</i> took off like a sleepwalker towards the Dark
Muse. Thus, Romanticism, as subsequently cooked up by &ldquo;experts&rdquo; during
and after, became a bloated, overanalysed, theory-bound,
cart-before-the-horse disaster. Or I will simply say German
Romanticism began true but veered off into the ditch&#x2014;all while
Wordsworthian English Romanticism really never had a Dark Muse to
begin with, except for Coleridge&rsquo;s gothic borrowings from the
eighteenth century.<label id='fnr.61' for='fnr-in.61.3978722' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>61</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.61.3978722' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>61</sup>

<p>
I contend Romanticism was a spiritual cultural <i>force majeure</i>, like a
huge river breaking into multiple braided channels across a broad
landscape with little to say about it other than it was wet. And so my
whole point with WutheriingUK is to urge you to simply <b>read, sigh,
imbibe&#x2014;repeat</b> and not follow any of the scholarly technocrats down
their musty rabbit holes where the spirit of it all suffocates. This
may seem naive context-free amateurish of me, but the alternative is
winding up lost and clueless as I believe the vast majority of
Romanticism scholars are. But let&rsquo;s get to <i>HttN</i>&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Reading <i>HttN</i> one cannot escape the sheer intensity of Novalis&rsquo;
swoon-fest over Night and Death. Here is a small taste
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I feel the flow of<br>
Death&rsquo;s youth-giving flood;<br>
To balsam and æther, it<br>
Changes my blood!<br>
I live all the daytime<br>
In faith and in might:<br>
And in holy rapture<br>
I die every night.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
and just before came
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
What delight, what pleasure offers <i>thy</i> life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night? Thy mother, it is she brings thee forth, and to her thou owest all thy glory.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
It my opinion <i>HttN</i> is one of the densest, purest, most direct
attesting to the Dark Muse ever.<label id='fnr.62' for='fnr-in.62.8368647' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>62</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.62.8368647' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>62</sup>
But <i>HttN</i> wasn&rsquo;t entirely new after all. Soon will be
discussed similar offerings from the previous eighteenth century.
</span> As the legend tells, his
inspiration came from being grief-stricken at the death of his
fifteen-year-old fiancée Sophie von Kühn, to whose grave he made a
pilgrimage for one hundred nights. The Jena Set writer Ludwig Tieck
described the teenage Sophie
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Even as a child, she gave an impression which&#x2014;because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely&#x2014;we must call super-earthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.

We&rsquo;ll dive into Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s very similar idealisations
in his possibly most popular poem <i>Annabel Lee</i> soon.
</span> And it was her death that threw Novalis into
trance, vision. <i>HttN</i> was most certainly not just the gymnastics of
flipping the sacred to profane and profane to sacred as Novalis
described romanticising poetising. He journeyed into Night and came
back with some of the most compelling Dark ever. But then yawned open
this great abyss between producers and describer-promoters&#x2026;<label id='fnr.64' for='fnr-in.64.6659724' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>64</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.64.6659724' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>64</sup>
Yes, give Wulf&rsquo;s <i>Magnificent Rebels</i> a shot. But you&rsquo;ll
quickly realise she is more like a gossip columnist going on about
celebrities than someone who understands what they were actually
doing. For all intents and purposes, she might as well be describing
Andy Warhol&rsquo;s <i>Factory</i>, a place where social buzz was more important
than the actual art.

<h3 id="orgac43560">John Keats&rsquo; sense of Beauty</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgac43560">
<p>
Samuel Taylor Coleridge is generally accepted as the leading
intellectualiser of British Romanticism during its inception roughly
parallel to the Jena Romantic liftoff. Following is a Coleridge quote
as good as any
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each
other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the
accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as
the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible
directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces
should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike
indestructible&#x2026; this one power with its two inherent indestructible
yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which
their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and
the process of our own self-consciousness.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, such wordy intellectualisations are the usual fodder seized
upon by academics whipping up copy. Again, Coleridge and
Wordsworth&rsquo;s <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> is considered the cornerstone of
English Romanticism.<label id='fnr.65' for='fnr-in.65.1722809' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>65</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.65.1722809' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>65</sup>
Again, <i>LB</i> is bereft of Dark, although Nature is spot-on
romanticised.
</span> Now, let us contrast this with what
English poet John Keats said years later in a 1817 letter to his
brothers George and Thomas
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;I mean <b>Negative Capability</b>, that is, when a man is capable of
being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
reaching after fact and reason&#x2014;Coleridge, for instance, would let go
by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of
mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with
half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no
further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty
overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all
consideration.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Hard and fast ideas, logically circumscribed, battling it out for
supremacy, while feelings and impressions and what-ifs lost in the
ruckus &#x2026; intellectualisations, great and lengthy, especially of the
&ldquo;Penetralium<label id='fnr.66' for='fnr-in.66.6341975' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>66</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.66.6341975' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>66</sup>

</span>
ramblings. Indeed, to <i>not</i> immediately intellectualise, but to hold
oneself in a counter-intuitive state of unresolved&#x2014;just to see where
it might lead.  Keats&rsquo; <i>Negative Capability</i> is about <i>cognitive
dissonance</i> as a great and necessary burden the poet must carry, a
process key to deeper understanding beyond neat and tidy piles of
logical-seeming words to impress other don&rsquo;t-get-it people. Then with
his simple ode to Beauty the poet obviates, obliterates the sterility
of intellectualisation. Here is the famed beginning of his &ldquo;poetic
romance&rdquo; <i>Endymion</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:<br>
Its loveliness increases; it will never<br>
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep<br>
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep<br>
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.<br>
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing<br>
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,<br>
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth<br>
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,<br>
Of all the unhealthy and o&rsquo;er-darkened ways<br>
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,<br>
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall<br>
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,<br>
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon<br>
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils<br>
With the green world they live in; and clear rills<br>
That for themselves a cooling covert make<br>
&rsquo;Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,<br>
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:<br>
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms<br>
We have imagined for the mighty dead;<br>
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:<br>
An endless fountain of immortal drink,<br>
Pouring unto us from the heaven&rsquo;s brink.<br>

In the 2009 film <i>Bright Star</i>, a touching verisimilar bio-drama about
Keats, there is a scene where, speaking to his love interest Fanny
Brawne, he says <i>A poet is not at all poetical. In fact, he the most
unpoetical thing in existence. He has no identity. He is continually
filling some other body&#x2014;the sun, the moon.</i> He then says, <i>Poetic
craft is a carcass, a sham. <b>If poetry does not come as naturally as
leaves to a tree then it had better not come at all</b>.</i> And then Fanny
says, <i>I still don&rsquo;t know how to work out a poem.</i> To which Keats
says<label id='fnr.68' for='fnr-in.68.3259718' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>68</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.68.3259718' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>68</sup>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bASfrZYnkvI?si=JKGP2LiHgOj-h9oL">Here</a> is the scene from the bio-pic <i>Bright Star</i>.
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving
in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the
lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not <i>work</i> the
lake out. It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and
emboldens the soul to accept mystery.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And thus, I would posit he, like I, did not see Romanticism as
something needs bundling and explaining and stuck with labels and
herded into categories. The point of hearing birdsong is not to think
about male birds warding off other males while trying to appeal to
females, but to luxuriate in the wonderful chorus of nature. Time and
time again I listen to or read a description of Romanticism and come
away with the feeling the scholar, the author understands nothing,
rather, is simply stringing disparate bits and bobs together towards
some verisimilitude of a penetralia they don&rsquo;t really get,
understand. And so I say the intellectual prison in which academe has
stuck Romanticism should be opened up, the guards soundly switched and
run off, the prisoners let back out into the wide fields and deep
woods.

<i>The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature&rsquo;s Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work</i> by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.
</span> author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to <i>thrive</i>, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, but wait,
haven&rsquo;t these bats jumped <i>outside</i> of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of <i>trans</i>-bat-ism. But is that a good thing?
In the meantime the bats profit. But for nature as a whole? In effect,
the bats have short-circuited their doom, their fate. Again, what are
the real long-term consequences?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps bats doing better is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis
the rest of their competitors and surrounding environment.<label id='fnr.70' for='fnr-in.70.7314257' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>70</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.70.7314257' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>70</sup>
Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven&rsquo;t noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats&rsquo; primary food sources.
</span> And
yet what happens when a species keeps thriving more and more,
increasing its success statistics, stepping over, beyond any of the
natural restrictions that real integration and harmony with nature
would have required? <b>Aren&rsquo;t we humans Exhibit A of just such an
out-of-control species?</b> And so I ask, how can all this so-called
thriving be good, end well?  How can a dominant species like
ours&#x2014;which always seems to be &ldquo;gaming the system,&rdquo; evermore
ingeniously and aggressively extra-natural&#x2014;not eventually have to
pay some price? Simply put, How can more and more people consuming
more and more resources and energy, each of us fantasising about
success and prosperity, not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?
</p>

<p>
Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to its tightly integrated niche, then
exponential growth ensues&#x2014;which eventually must hit an inflexion
point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards an
inevitable overshoot and crash.
</p>

<p>
To my mind, Emily Brontë was just this sort of hard-pressed little bat
out in the wilds&#x2014;colony-less, huddled in a hollow tree, barely eking
out a marginal life. Here is her <i>Plead for me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Why I have persevered to shun<br>
The common paths that others run;<br>
And on a strange road journeyed on<br>
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—<br>
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.<br>
<br>
These once indeed seemed Beings divine,<br>
And they perchance heard vows of mine<br>
And saw my offerings on their shrine—<br>
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,<br>
And mine were worthily despised;<br>
<br>
My Darling Pain that wounds and sears<br>
And wrings a blessing out from tears<br>
By deadening me to real cares;<br>
And yet, a king&#x2014;though prudence well<br>
Have taught thy subject to rebel.<br>
<br>
And am I wrong to worship where<br>
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,<br>
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?<br>
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me<br>
And tell why I have chosen thee!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I consider this her ode to skipping the trans-human thrive scene of
her day and striking out into some Beyond to commune with her God of
Visions. Again, I must believe she was a little bat fluttering across
the semi-wilderness moorland, as true an existential <i>underdog</i>&#x2014;an
equal of all the other underdog wild critters&#x2014;as was still possible
back then.
</p>

<p>
Compare this with today&rsquo;s outdoor adventurer who clad in his technical
gear from REI, Patagonia, North Face, drives to government set-aside
wilds such as the Smokies mentioned above in a four-wheel-drive Jeep
Cherokee, consumes protein bars and electrolyte drinks, listens to
music with earbuds, takes smart phone pictures and GoPro videos. Any
mishaps? Call for immediate helicopter rescue on the iPhone satellite
connection&#x2026; At some point we&rsquo;re just amateur Earth astronauts, no?
When nature is truly in balance, all participants are underdogs to
some degree. But we demand and have gained total dominance over
nature.
</p>

<p>
Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced malnutrition, contaminated
water, tuberculosis &#x2014; pick one, two, or all three&#x2014;five months
after her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the greater world outside
of her tiny Haworth village and its surrounding hills for a few
months.<label id='fnr.71' for='fnr-in.71.47737' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>71</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.71.47737' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>71</sup>
A stay in Belgium to learn French and a short-lived gig in
nearby Halifax as a governess.
</span> As I&rsquo;ve said, hers was a world containing nothing
modern as we know it, e.g., a cut on a toe could lead to an infection
requiring amputation, or even worse.
</p>

<p>
And yet one might ask if her existence in the early nineteen century
was really so very wild and rugged. Was she still not observing nature
from civilization&rsquo;s relative place of safety, thereby rendering her
observations just as tainted, just as removed and relative as ours
today? I say no. Clearly our modern place of safety is maximal, hers
minimal, as we of the twenty-first century float above cruel Nature on
unprecedented levels of modern high-tech
materialism.<label id='fnr.72' for='fnr-in.72.7297817' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>72</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.72.7297817' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>72</sup>
We consume upwards of one hundred times the resources and
energy per capita as did one of our European ancestors from
1800 &#x2026; and so the bigger the dance floor, the crazier the dancing.
</span> Nonetheless, I contend hers was a unique vantage
point, neither too exposed nor removed from elemental nature.
</p>

<p>
So often I am confronted with modern scoffers who would have us
believe Romantic Era poets only knew nature from picnics held at
country estates where dandies and their pampered ladies were attended
by servants, as seen, for example, in Hollywood film versions of Jane
Austen&rsquo;s <i>Emma</i><label id='fnr.73' for='fnr-in.73.9966157' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>73</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.73.9966157' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>73</sup>
There is nothing really otherworldly Dark or Romanticist as I
know it about Jane Austen, sadly. She was seemingly devoid,
non-pursuant of Dostoyevski&rsquo;s POEH. Although she once did say,
&ldquo;Pictures of perfection, as you know, make me sick and wicked.&rdquo;
(Letter to her niece Fanny Knight, 23 March 1817.)

<p>
Again, for us moderns nature is a <i>place</i>, a <i>location</i> away from and
diametrically opposite our modern interior spaces. Nature today is
seen as this vast other place, the <i>Great Outdoors</i>. Therefore, the
farther afield from modern civilization we can go, the truer and more
authentic nature supposedly becomes. And so we create a <i>nature
continuum</i> whereby a trackless wilderness as far from civilization as
possible is the truest nature, while hardly nature at all would be a
ditch overgrown with weeds behind one of our triple-paned windowed,
vinyl-siding-clad, forced-air-HVAC suburban houses. Nature can only be
very wild, thus, very far away from the safety of our space-colony
civilization. But let me again be blunt
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We do not get more nature simply because we have gone like explorer
astronauts way farther out from our sterile, artificial exclusively
human home base. <i>Nature is not something close or remote.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
It is precisely because we have so destroyed proximate Nature that we
elevate far-afield wilderness to a practically quasi-off-planet
status. Writers like Ernest Hemingway and Jack London exploit fright
memes of Nature as a distant, exotic, hostile place &#x2026; again,
virtually identical to science fiction stories of strange, hostile,
dangerous, alien planets conquered by brave, intrepid astronauts. To
be sure, many sci-fi depictions of alien worlds are interchangeable
with the Klondike Yukon that London described.
</p>

<p>
No, my poets of the so-called Romantic Era were not pampered dandies
with their fine ladies strolling for a few bored minutes on manicured
estate grounds. Nor were they beneficiaries of the &ldquo;Age of
Exploration&rdquo; colonialism. My poets were mainly short-lived little bats
in their crevasses and corners, as pressed as any bats have ever been.

&#x2026;though Britain was seeing Dark decades before Novalis and German
Romanticism. As I do with Novalis and his <i>HttN</i>, I can&rsquo;t help but
believe these eighteenth-century English principals were more
sleepwalkers than any sort of intentional movement leaders. First came
The <i>Graveyard School</i> of poetry full of doom and gloom, then just
past mid-century the gothic romance novel arrived with an even more
graphic doom-and-gloom. But then came what might be called the <i>Night

<p>
It was only a few decades into the eighteenth century when there
emerged in Britain a style of poetry which has since been named the
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_poets">Graveyard School</a></i>. My Exhibit A of Graveyard is Edward Young&rsquo;s
epic-length <i><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33156/33156-h/33156-h.htm">The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts on Life, Death, &amp;

From my 1853 copy <br>
<img src="images/NightThoughtsBook2.jpg" alt="NightThoughtsBook2.jpg"> <br>
<br>
</span>
Bursting with a grandiosity only poetry can reach, Young relentlessly
spins out darkness and doom. To be sure, he is Dark with a shudder,
full of fright memes meant to weigh down and ultimately defeat&#x2014;if
taken seriously. A quick taste, s&rsquo;il vous plaît
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
"When the cock crew, he wept”&#x2014;smote by that eye<br>
Which looks on me, on all: that Power, who bids<br>
This midnight sentinel, with clarion shrill<br>

Rouse souls from slumber, into thoughts of heaven.<br>
Shall I too weep? Where then is fortitude?<br>
And, fortitude abandon’d, where is man?<br>
I know the terms on which he sees the light;<br>
He that is born, is listed; life is war;<br>
Eternal war with woe. Who bears it best,<br>
Deserves it least&#x2026;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
&#x2026;indeed, unrelenting doom and woe. Typical of Graveyard
School, there is no hope, no escape, just the weight of an assumed
curse, then processions of lamentation to cliff edges and fated
tumbling thereoff
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Art, brainless Art! our furious charioteer&#x2026;<br>
&#x2026;Drives headlong towards the precipice of death;<br>
Death, most our dread; death thus more dreadful made:<br>
Oh, what a riddle of absurdity!<br>

<p>
or
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
From short (as usual) and disturb’d repose,<br>
I wake: how happy they, who wake no more!<br>
Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave.<br>

Tumultuous; where my wreck’d desponding thought<br>
From wave to wave of fancied misery<br>
At random drove&#x2026;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Of course every student of the Dark Muse should read Young&rsquo;s
<i>Night-thoughts</i>. And yet this over-the-top doom hyperbole eventually
delivers even the most indulgent reader to incredulity. To be sure, at
some point it becomes farce. Though Graveyard had a more
contemplative, measured side. For example, Thomas Gray&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44299/elegy-written-in-a-country-churchyard">Elegy
Written in a Country Churchyard</a></i> (1751). To be sure, the eulogising of
the dead is a much older and well established genre, typically
emphasising the qualities of the deceased over the dark, eternal abyss
his grave might represent. While we&rsquo;re not meant to survive Young&rsquo;s
world, Gray&rsquo;s elegy of a lost friend is Dark and fatalist and yet
reverent faithful
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,<br>
Heav&rsquo;n did a recompense as largely send:<br>
He gave to Mis&rsquo;ry all he had, a tear,<br>

</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Here whatever negatives&#x2014;sinister, morose, and doomy&#x2014;may be
swirling about, God in his heavenly domain has our backs. Gray doesn&rsquo;t
try to beat us down as much as did the hardcore Graveyard
Schoolers. And yet with Graveyard, Britain had arrived at a public
exhibition of Dark.
</p>

<p>
Was Dark simply in the air? In my humble opinion, Graveyard arrived
unexpected, a natural, organic upwelling&#x2014;however spotty its actual
expression. Which begs the question, What rises to cultural and
intellectual prominence in an age?<label id='fnr.75' for='fnr-in.75.9128117' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>75</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.75.9128117' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>75</sup>
&#x2026;that is, in an past age not exposed to the science of
modern public relations. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">this</a> about Edward Bernays and the birth
of modern advertising and public relations. TL;DR: Since Bernays, no
&ldquo;movement&rdquo; in our modern times can be considered natural and organic,
rather, the result of somebody&rsquo;s public relations campaign.
</span> To be sure, many of that era
condemned gothic and Graveyard as subculture. But eventually came
refinement, which I might call the <i>Night School</i>. Though intervening
was the <i>gothic novel</i>.

hand, was not acceptable, seen as too revealing invasive personal,
i.e., it is improper, unseemly, distasteful to expose even an
imaginary person&rsquo;s life details in such an open and revealing
fashion. According to this attitude, it was a crude thing to so freely
fantasise human goings-on in a fictitious way. Rather, literature must
ennoble the human as a being created in the likeness of God, and not
dwell on his mundanity and failings. After all, a novel was neither
factual (e.g. a saint&rsquo;s hagiography) nor high lyrical poetic (e.g.,
church hymn lyrics or <i>Heldenlieder</i>). A novel/roman was simply too
plain-spoken, i.e., the unavoidable clarity of straight descriptive
writing invariably generated an undesirable ordinariness. And so it
was in this mise en scène that the prose novel bumped along
post-Medieval Age as a barely tolerated corruption of writing, as a
regrettable parallel to poetry, consumed mainly by easily excited
arriviste vulgarian middle-class women. But then as the middle class
grew in power and numbers, the novel came to the fore, especially in
the eighteenth century.<label id='fnr.78' for='fnr-in.78.9319795' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>78</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.78.9319795' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>78</sup>

Modern academe considers the novel <i>The Castle of Otranto, A Gothic
Story</i>, appearing in its first edition in 1764, to be the official
start of British <i>gothic</i> literature.<label id='fnr.79' for='fnr-in.79.2146037' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>79</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.79.2146037' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>79</sup>
One giveaway is <i>gothic</i> in the title. Perhaps read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction">this
overview</a> of Gothic fiction.
</span> Written by the excentric,
iconoclastic English nobleman Horace Walpole (1717 – 1797), <i>Otranto</i>
is a melodrama set in sixteenth-century Naples offering slumming
readers a big dose of darkness, doom, and woe. Walpole&rsquo;s penchant for
medievalism rode the long-simmering nostalgic idealisation of the
Medieval Age<label id='fnr.80' for='fnr-in.80.8661255' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>80</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.80.8661255' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>80</sup>
Walpole initially claimed <i>Otranto</i> to be a medieval
manuscript he had discovered and translated, when all along it had
been his own creation.
</span>, while the adjective <i>gothic</i> referred to medieval
Gothic architecture.<label id='fnr.81' for='fnr-in.81.3577937' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>81</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.81.3577937' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>81</sup>
&#x2026;although this is ironic since the actual label Gothic had
been used pejoratively in the Renaissance alluding to the
destructive barbarian Goths.
</span> Gothic &ldquo;horror&rdquo; was an instant hit, and
other writers and influencers quickly joined in creating a full-on
Dark movement.<label id='fnr.82' for='fnr-in.82.3522630' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>82</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.82.3522630' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>82</sup>

<span class="cap">Wolf's Crag from Walter Scott's gothic <i>The Bride of Lammermore</i> </span>

<p>
Above is an etching from a publication of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_of_Lammermoor">The
Bride of Lammermore</a></i> (1819). Consider the sheer visual density and
heaviness of the scene (click on the image to be taken to a larger
version). Whence, wherefore this heaviness, this portent?  Predominant
is nature dark, inhospitable, threatening. The human-built castle is
primitive, isolated, and vulnerable, the riders miniscule, exposed. It
is as if every single living cell&#x2014;plant, animal, human&#x2014;is clinging
to life by a thread, and any dim green and blue hues of vegetation and
sea are wholly irrelevant. The scene evokes danger, dysphoria,
something horrific just waiting to transpire. But again how, why? Why
such darkness and what was (and still is) the appeal? Hitchcock
tautologies aside, modern academe has offered theories about the
socio-political-psychological landscape of the times, and yet these
&ldquo;experts&rdquo; only sound supercilious and patronising from their modern
triumphalist perches, as if they are searching for a disease to
explain a malady, weakness to explain indulgence. No, indeed, Dark,
even when crude and heavy, predominates, arrests, mystifies, the
appeal all the stronger for its recessive, ungraspable spherical
symmetry. To be sure, this &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; of gothic in the eighteenth
century was overwrought, overweight with its fright memes, but
undeniably popular and onto something real about the inner human
experience.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbea751c">
<p>
As assuredly personal and original as Novalis&rsquo; <i>Hymns to the Night</i>
was, Englishwoman Anna  Lætitia Barbauld&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_(Barbauld)/A_Summer_Evening%27s_Meditation">A Summer Evening&rsquo;s
Meditation</a></i> had already appeared in 1773 praising the night in a
similarly cherished, solemn way. Without deeper investigation I have
no real idea if Barbauld&rsquo;s <i>Meditation</i> started what I&rsquo;m calling the
<i>Night School</i>, but as a working theory, yes, she offered a new
perspective to Dark with an accessibility and maturity not seen in
Graveyard or gothic horror. After a nod to Young&rsquo;s <i>Night-thoughts</i>
with the quote, <i>One sun by day, by night ten thousand shine</i>,
Barbauld launches directly into her summer night and its canopy of
stars&#x2026;
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Tis past! The sultry tyrant of the south<br>
Has spent his short-liv&rsquo;d rage; more grateful hours<br>
Move silent on; the skies no more repel<br>
The dazzled sight, but with mild maiden beams<br>
Of temper&rsquo;d light, invite the cherish&rsquo;d eye<br>
To wander o&rsquo;er their sphere; where hung aloft<br>
Dian&rsquo;s bright crescent, like a silver bow<br>
New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns<br>
Impatient for the night, and seems to push<br>
Her brother down the sky. Fair Venus shines<br>
E&rsquo;en in the eye of day; with sweetest beam<br>
Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood<br>
Of soften&rsquo;d radiance from her dewy locks.<br>
The shadows spread apace; while meeken&rsquo;d Eve<br>
Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires<br>
Thro&rsquo; the Hesperian gardens of the west,<br>
And shuts the gates of day. &rsquo;Tis now the hour<br>
When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
No woe, no gloom-and-doom, rather, a relentless parade of visceral and
natural Dark hyperconductivity. Barbauld hauls us outdoors to partake,
imbibe, behold. We are not obsessing on doom, rather, we are touched,
moved to reflect in reverence&#x2014;
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;But are they silent all? or is there not<br>
A tongue in every star that talks with man,<br>
And wooes him to be wife; nor wooes in vain:<br>
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,<br>
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.<br>
At this still hour the self-collected soul<br>
Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there<br>
Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;<br>
An embryo God; a spark of fire divine,<br>
Which must burn on for ages, when the sun,<br>
(Fair transitory creature of a day!)<br>
Has clos&rsquo;d his golden eye, and wrap&rsquo;d in shades<br>
Forgets his wonted journey thro&rsquo; the east.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Night over day. Night a more expansive, passive, more nuanced interim
inviting deeper, more mature human introspection. Far distant, cool
and gentle are the myriad stars, unlike our single oversized and often
ruinous local star of day. And here is some of my own doggerel called
<i>From a Grandniece To Her Great-aunt At Her Great-uncle’s Funeral</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
You see, dear Auntie,<br>
Day is all supposes,<br>
Night but only a few.<br>
Night quietly closes<br>
Day’s great to-do.<br>
Lost on the Day,<br>
I wait for deepest Night,<br>
for Darkness and I must<br>
Decline clamant Light.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I mean to say this is my kind of Dark, i.e., free of any campy fright
devices. Most assuredly every protégé of the Dark Muse must read
Barbauld&rsquo;s lengthy masterpiece. Hers is an exposition of natural
darkness, placing it far above the reproach of gothic horror
detractors. Though <i>Meditation</i> was no doubt a singleton, a unicorn
whose influence seemed to lay dormant for decades.<label id='fnr.84' for='fnr-in.84.2066384' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>84</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.84.2066384' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>84</sup>
&#x2026;although Wordsworth would later mention Barbauld and
<i>Meditation</i> as inspirational.
</span> One Barbauld
biographer mentioned a trend of that time of ladies studying
astronomy. But obviously Barbauld is waxing Dark, not embellishing
celestial bodies. Perusing her other poems, yes, she dwells on nature,
sometimes in a dusky way, but addressing Dark as she did with
<i>Meditation</i> never again appeared so directly during her times. Today
she is known as an influential social commentator, moralist, and
educator, not as proto-Romantic. And so I must jump ahead some fifty
years and bring in Brontëan poetry as a continuation of this Night
School thread. Haworth Emily&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Poems_of_Emily_Bront%C3%AB/Stars">Stars</a></i> is just one her many examples
of Night School from someone who probably had never read nor heard of
Barbauld&rsquo;s <i>Meditation</i>. Exactly like Barbauld, in <i>Stars</i> Haworth
Emily lauds the night and its starry sky
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Thought followed thought, star followed star<br>
Through boundless regions, on;<br>
While one sweet influence, near and far,<br>
Thrilled through, and proved us one!<br>
<br>
Why did the morning dawn to break<br>
So great, so pure, a spell;<br>
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,<br>
Where your cool radiance fell?<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
The night sky&rsquo;s depth and expanse over the trammels of life during
sunlight, indeed. And so the last two stanzas
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night;<br>
Oh, night and stars, return!<br>
And hide me from the hostile light<br>
That does not warm, but burn;<br>
<br>
That drains the blood of suffering men;<br>
Drinks tears, instead of dew;<br>
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,<br>
And only wake with you!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Night School redeems Dark by pulling it out of the ostentatiousness,
the gimmickry of Graveyard and gothic. Started by Barbauld, it was
independently embraced by others. Let&rsquo;s look at sister Anne Brontë&rsquo;s
<i>Night</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I love the silent hour of night,<br>
For blissful dreams may then arise,<br>
Revealing to my charmed sight<br>
What may not bless my waking eyes.<br>
<br>
And then a voice may meet my ear,<br>
That death has silenced long ago;<br>
And hope and rapture may appear<br>
Instead of solitude and woe.<br>
<br>
Cold in the grave for years has lain<br>
The form it was my bliss to see;<br>
And only dreams can bring again,<br>
The darling of my heart to me.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Simpler, more measured was Anne&rsquo;s poetry than her sister&rsquo;s. And she
includes the grave by eulogising either of her older sisters Maria or
Elizabeth, or her mother, but again, sans drama.
</p>

<p>
This calmer, more introspective Dark dominated the eighteenth
century. And let us not forget the many poems devoted to the
moon. Here is Anne&rsquo;s <i>Fluctuations</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
What though the Sun had left my sky;<br>
To save me from despair<br>
The blessed Moon arose on high,<br>
And shone serenely there.<br>
<br>
I watched her, with a tearful gaze,<br>
Rise slowly o&rsquo;er the hill,<br>
While through the dim horizon&rsquo;s haze<br>
Her light gleamed faint and chill.<br>
<br>
I thought such wan and lifeless beams<br>
Could ne&rsquo;er my heart repay<br>
For the bright sun&rsquo;s most transient gleams<br>
That cheered me through the day:<br>
<br>
But, as above that mist&rsquo;s control<br>
She rose, and brighter shone,<br>
I felt her light upon my soul;<br>
But now—that light is gone!<br>
<br>
Thick vapours snatched her from my sight,<br>
And I was darkling left,<br>
All in the cold and gloomy night,<br>
Of light and hope bereft:<br>
<br>
Until, methought, a little star<br>
Shone forth with trembling ray,<br>
To cheer me with its light afar—<br>
But that, too, passed away.<br>
<br>
Anon, an earthly meteor blazed<br>
The gloomy darkness through;<br>
I smiled, yet trembled while I gazed—<br>
But that soon vanished too!<br>
<br>
And darker, drearier fell the night<br>
Upon my spirit then;—<br>
But what is that faint struggling light?<br>
Is it the Moon again?<br>
<br>
Kind Heaven! increase that silvery gleam<br>
And bid these clouds depart,<br>
And let her soft celestial beam<br>
Restore my fainting heart!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Here we may imagine the youngest Brontë bowed if not weighed down by
her earthly afflictions, cares, deprivations, but then in this lean,
hungry, susceptible state caught in an emotional whirling, carried,
borne up by the natural nighttime procession of sun to moon and
stars. She speaks of her tearful gaze, her fainting heart, her
spirits, her emotional exposure. She is a vulnerable ward of nature,
but tenaciously pursuant of its subtleties. Indeed, back then it was
always subtleties, delicate qualities found in nature by the
vulnerable if not pathetic human, an exacting counting of seemingly
modest blessings which then gained sublime ascendency.
</p>

<p>
If I wasn&rsquo;t pledged to Emily, I might say Anne has an even finer take
on Dark than her older sister. I might dare to say Anne&rsquo;s Christianity
is more conventional, whereas Emily with her obvious
thought-behind-thoughts mental state took a starker, more fatalist view of
God. Anne humble, Emily defiant perhaps; <b>nevertheless, the Dark Muse
absolutely owned by these Brontës!</b>
</p>

<p>
Just for some balance, let me mention another Night Schooler, namely,
the Swiss poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Keller">Gottfried Keller</a>. Again, he is even later by some
three or four decades than the Brontës. Here is his <i>Winternacht</i> or
<i>Winter Night</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Not a wingbeat went through the world;<br>
silent and brilliant lay the white snow.<br>
Not a puff of cloud hung in the starry canopy,<br>
no wave surged in the torpid lake.<br>
<br>
From the depths climbed a lake-tree,<br>
to its crown encased in ice;<br>
and upon its branches climbed the water nymph,<br>
gazing up through the green ice.<br>
<br>
There I stood upon the thin glass<br>
that separated me from the black depths;<br>
Close beneath my feet I saw<br>
her white beauty, limb for limb.<br>
<br>
With smothered sorrow she groped<br>
here and there on the hard barrier.<br>
Never will I will forget her dark expression;<br>
always, always, shall it remain in my mind!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
One of my favourites, I have always wondered what the protagonist did
with the rest of his life. Did he return to the lake trying to find
his water nymph; or did he resign himself to his mortal and mundane
life? In any event, the mystery and allure of a forest in deep winter
night is undeniable. Such magic and mystery obviously could not have
occurred in daylight.
</p>

<p>
With Night School, first there is Nature Dark, then comes human
reflection upon that natural Dark, i.e., no fake Dark, no camp, no
hyperbole. Just the deepest possible descriptions of the world in
darkness bringing forth some of humanity&rsquo;s finest insights.

<p>
Academe&rsquo;s take on Romanticism&#x2014;a very big elephant in the middle of
the room, indeed. What to do with this beast wont to co-opt and usurp
my principals, and, in general, completely miss my Dark Muse?<label id='fnr.85' for='fnr-in.85.984248' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>85</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.85.984248' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>85</sup>
Indeed, academe <i>completely</i> misses the Dark Muse, incessantly
pigeon-holing it as gothic fright&#x2014;or worse. Again, the whole point
of this effort of mine is to get Dark out of its academe and media
prisons.
</span>
Foremost is how academe Romanticism seems more the labeling work of
these clueless busy-bodies than any intentional movement from the
actual creators.<label id='fnr.86' for='fnr-in.86.8520723' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>86</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.86.8520723' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>86</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., we would never have known Emily Brontë&rsquo;s poetry had
not sister Charlotte pilfered her manuscripts from their hiding place
and published them without her sister&rsquo;s permission. Similarly, the
reclusive Emily Dickinson only half-heartedly ever sought
publication. But after her death <i>thousands</i> of poems were discovered
in her room.
</span> Which begs the question posed by the
highly-respected twentieth-century humanities professor Isaiah Berlin
in his lecture series on Romanticism whether those times were not
something timeless, a permanent state of mind wholly outside of
anyone&rsquo;s historical fence work.<label id='fnr.87' for='fnr-in.87.2682680' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>87</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.87.2682680' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>87</sup>
Academe typically fences the Romantic Era in between 1800
and 1850.
</span> Nevertheless, there is no
avoiding the sweeping intellectualisations, the mountains of churn
from Romanticism&rsquo;s academic investigators. And as I say, <i>none</i> get
Dark; or, the more they think they know, the less they actually
do. Alas.
</p>

<p>
Thus, the cleft between what Romanticist scholars say we are reading
and what you or I might simply feel upon reading can be huge. And that
is my whole point here. Worse, scholars can be all over the map with
these pontifications and theories. Andrea Wulf&rsquo;s <i>Magnificent
Rebels</i> depicts Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as the adult-supervision
den dad of Jena Romanticism, and yet here is something he actually
said about Romanticism
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Klassisch ist das Gesunde, romantisch das Kranke &#x2026; or
&#x2026; Romanticism is disease. It is the weak, the sickly, the battle cry
of a school of wild poets and Catholic reactionaries; whereas
classicism is strong, fresh, gay, sound, like Homer and the
<i>Nibelungenlied</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I won&rsquo;t accuse Wulf of poor research or intentional
obfuscation. Having been a founder of <i>Sturm und Drang</i>, perhaps we
should grant Goethe the right to have been of two minds. Perhaps he
was initially attracted to the Jena buzz, all the <i>haute pensée</i>
sprung up in his backyard, but then soured on its content,
implications, the personalities behind it. Certainly Schiller
did. Still, this as an example of how diverse, even contradictory
Romantic Era scholarship can be.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the would-be shepherds, the explainers talked something into
existence&#x2014;the Jena Set, Coleridge, Germaine de Staël, Emerson et
al.&#x2014;but again, I believe the actual producers were far-sighted,
inward-gazing, quasi-timeless unicorns not following guidelines or
living up to anybody&rsquo;s expectations.<label id='fnr.88' for='fnr-in.88.474339' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>88</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.88.474339' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>88</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., the Brontës were pastor&rsquo;s daughters in rural West
Yorkshire with little exposure to (taint from?) the cultural and
literary buzz of the cities.
</span> &#x2026; and most certainly
they did not &ldquo;write to spec&rdquo; or pastiche, as was fairly obviously the
case with gothic horror novelists. And so I say sifting through all
the academic chaff gets us nowhere versus simply reading and silently
contemplating the product itself. All for naught listing facts and
figures, creating categories and pigeonholes, imagining commonalities,
generalities, throwing a formulaic hyperspace over the lone wolf
creators. Caveat emptor. If the purpose of a poem, as Keats said, is
to embolden the soul to accept mystery, then such analytical death
marches must be seen as antithetical. Analysing mystery is a fool&rsquo;s
errand.<label id='fnr.89' for='fnr-in.89.1106891' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>89</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.89.1106891' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>89</sup>
One hot mess is the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0144q90/episodes/guide">BBC&rsquo;s series on Romanticism</a>. (Catch it on
YouTube under <i>The Romantics: <a href="https://youtu.be/oLwRXlSgiSQ?si=y4a1MQek8Ac0pkyJ">Liberty</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/liVQ21KZfOI?si=GpsPOUfS_l6w6r8_">Nature</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/R6mefXs5h9o?si=c-cJk0fKTneunPZH">Eternity</a>)</i>. And then
Bertrand Russell in his severe, left-brained <i>The History of Western
Philosophy</i> mangles away at Romanticism in his consummate pedantic
way. These are Exhibit A1/A2 of people who don&rsquo;t get it but must sound
important erudite. More palatable perhaps is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIffazJIrLo&amp;list=PLhP9EhPApKE_9uxkmfSIt2JJK6oKbXmd-&amp;pp=iAQB">Isaiah Berlin&rsquo;s 1965
lectures on Romanticism</a>.
</span> For me at least, the principals <i>re-sensitised</i>, while their
describers have only managed to <i>de-sensitise</i> with their mystery-deaf
approach.
</p>

<p>
Some insight comes from two men of this era who unfortunately wore
both hats, i.e., creator and explainer, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and
Edgar Allan Poe. With them we see their creations take us into the
ephemeral mists of Romanticism&rsquo;s subtleties and sublimities, while
their intellectualizations and pontifications thereof sound windy, if
not shrill out to ridiculous. No wonder the concept of left-brain,
right-brain arose,<label id='fnr.90' for='fnr-in.90.9636768' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>90</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.90.9636768' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>90</sup>
The best ideas about left/right brain are those of Iain
McGilchrist. Try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK7XG3t2nFg&amp;list=PLqBHk3itxyPDKFnwj8-SmlwHra64cCrky&amp;pp=iAQB">these</a>.
</span> as nothing else can describe this
split-personality confusion. But the urban salons necessarily
trafficked in rational, left-brain talk and copy. And this is for me
the <i>crisis of Romanticism</i>, i.e., the huge divide between the
creators and their content versus the describers and promoters. Yes Mr
Keats, we shall luxuriate long in the water, but then slowly, gently
swim back to the shore to gracefully and silently rise out of the
water and stand exulted for the whole experience. Of course we cannot
luxuriate in the lake forever, but upon exiting we must somehow hold
the experience in awe and reverence and not grasp for logical
explanations, which can only turn it into a show, a farce, even so, a
sham, a carcass.

Today a hit song or a TikTok video can go &ldquo;viral&rdquo; globally in less
than a day, with imitations instantly springing up like mushrooms
after rain. But in the closing years of the eighteenth century there
just seemed to be something in the air, which came to be called
Romanticism, apparently first by Jena Set founder Friedrich
Schlegel<label id='fnr.91' for='fnr-in.91.7900760' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>91</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.91.7900760' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>91</sup>
<a href="https://engines.egr.uh.edu/english-romanticism/what-romanticism">This</a> will save you some googling. Note again the tortured
origin of the term <i>romantic</i>.
</span> &#x2026; after Coleridge and Wordsworth&rsquo;s collaboration
<i>Lyrical Ballads</i> (first edition) appeared in 1798 and Novalis&rsquo; <i>HttN</i>
in 1800. But again, my principle principal, Emily Brontë, who wrote
decades later, arguably knew very little to absolutely nothing about
Jena, Novalis, or even much of Coleridge and Wordsworth other than
perhaps a reading of their <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. Even later, Poe had
supposedly had encountered translations of Ludwig Tieck&rsquo;s short
stories. Otherwise, there had not been much cross-fertilisation,
rather, the Romanticism Muse was just in the air.
</p>

<p>
<i>Early German Romanticism</i><label id='fnr.92' for='fnr-in.92.9614924' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>92</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.92.9614924' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>92</sup>
For what it&rsquo;s worth, German Romanticism can be broken down
into Jena, Heidelberg, then Berlin Romanticism&#x2026;
</span> began when Novalis&rsquo; <i>HttN</i> burst
upon the scene in the very first year of the nineteenth century. Clear
to me, however, is that <i>HttN</i> was a one-off that came out of the
blue, thus, certainly not intentional, positioned for, or tailored to
any specific trend or agenda. Contrast this with Goethe&rsquo;s play
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Tauris_(Goethe)">Iphigenia in Tauris</a></i> (versions in 1779, 1781, 1786), based on
Euripides&rsquo; original which was specifically meant to be a showcase
example of Goethe&rsquo;s ideal of modern classicism, i.e., his and
Friedrich Schiller&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Classicism">Weimar Classicism</a>. But the so-called <i>Jena Set</i>,
an intellectual salon centred around the Schlegel brothers, August
Wilhelm and Friedrich, along with August&rsquo;s wife Caroline, seized upon
the mostly absentee Novalis as their boy wonder <i>Liebling</i>
mascot&#x2014;and the conflation of producer and describers began in
earnest. But just one year after <i>HttN</i> appeared Novalis dies on
them. The seed sprouted, the Jena Set went on to create an entire
mountain range of Jena Romanticism supposedly inspired by boy-man hero
Novalis<label id='fnr.93' for='fnr-in.93.7120933' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>93</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.93.7120933' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>93</sup>
Must again mention Christina Wulf&rsquo;s non-fiction tome
<i>Magnificent Rebels</i> as Exhibit A of how the describers and explainers
just did not get it. Wulf&rsquo;s detailed description of the &ldquo;Jena Set&rdquo;
sounds similar to accounts of Andy Warhol&rsquo;s <i>Factory</i> and its bipolar
crowd.
</span>. Philosopher Schelling was on board, and it is his
&ldquo;nature philosophy&rdquo; which is adopted and promoted by Coleridge
(sometimes as literal translation as in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographia_Literaria">Biographia
Literaria</a> - 1817) and eventually by Emerson and the Transcendentalists
in the Colonies. Any brightening of the ominous tremendous <i>HttN</i> is
irksome, but if we stay loyal to Dark, we may reach further back to
the English <i><a href="https://www.britannica.com/art/graveyard-school">Graveyard School</a></i> of the mid- and late-eighteenth
century.

</span> Unfortunately The Wikipedia description of
Dark Romantic trots out all the negative stereotypes of Dark. But as
one biographer noted, Poe struggled all his short adult life to make a
living as a writer and poet. One supposed quote of his said “&#x2026; your
writer of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big pen,
with a very blunt nib.” However the American publishing world was
rarely supportive, as one historian said, eager to move on from Dark
and gothic. And yet Poe always seemed to find audiences.

<p class="verse">
It was many and many a year ago,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;By the name of Annabel Lee;<br>
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Than to love and be loved by me.<br>
<br>
I was a child and she was a child,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
But we loved with a love that was more than love—<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I and my Annabel Lee—<br>
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Coveted her and me.<br>
<br>
And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
So that her highborn kinsmen came<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;And bore her away from me,<br>
To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea.<br>
<br>
The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Went envying her and me—<br>
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.<br>
<br>
But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of those who were older than we—<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of many far wiser than we—<br>
And neither the angels in Heaven above<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Nor the demons down under the sea<br>
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
<br>
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In her sepulchre there by the sea—<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In her tomb by the sounding sea.<br>

</p>

<p>
My principals had nothing to do with Schlegels or Coleridge or Emerson.

  There a gave way to the more
refined <i>Night School</i>, as well as <i>Graveside School</i> blossoming in
the early nineteenth century.
A Midsummer&rsquo;s Meditation

<p>
Again, I suss out that both Poe and Emily Brontë got it and gave it
with their poetry, but got lost in their prose, falling back into gothic.

<p>
Fright v. melancholy.

<p>
After writing on my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> for the past seven years
I have made a rather bitter discovery, namely, that mankind is largely
wandering about clueless---<i>seriously</i> clueless.

<p>
POEH Zen full-time, Tibetan half-time. But EB Byron

<blockquote>
<p>
I’m happiest when most away
I can bear my soul from its home of clay
On a windy night when the moon is bright
And the eye can wander through worlds of light –
When I am not and none beside –
Nor earth nor sea nor cloudless sky –
But only spirit wandering wide
Through infinite immensity.
</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>
I live not in myself, but I become				
Portion of that around me; and to me
High mountains are a feeling, but the hum
Of human cities torture: I can see
Nothing to loathe in nature, save to be
A link reluctant in a fleshy chain,
Class’d among creatures, when the soul can flee,
And with the sky, the peak, the heaving plain
Of ocean, or the stars, mingle, and not in vain.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd2ce4f6">
<p>
Bear with me as I once more ruminate the fibrous Romanticism cud. By
now the reader knows I want my principals to have come to their
sublime poetry &ldquo;as naturally as leaves came to a tree,&rdquo; as the film
<i>Bright Star</i>&rsquo;s Keats said. To be sure, I insist my visionaries were
just that, timeless trancy visionary, and not to be reduced to puppets
dangling on strings connected, owing to proto-this or precursor-that
on the factory assembly line of time.<label id='fnr.95' for='fnr-in.95.2835404' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>95</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.95.2835404' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>95</sup>
A quote from M.H. Abrams&rsquo; laborious <i>The Mirror and the Lamp</i>
would insist <br>
<i>Even an aesthetic philosophy so abstract and seemingly academic as
that of Kant can be shown to have modified the work of poets.</i> <br>
Really? I doubt the Brontë sisters read much Kant. But then Abrams
never mentions the Brontës&#x2026;
</span> Certainly they were of
their times, and yet outliers, outsiders, unicorns, not for lumping
together or lining up on any ivory tower shelf some two hundred years
later. Still, we have this most <i>unnatural</i> box, this clammy container
created by academe to hold, control, own, to <i>jail</i> my greats, namely,
<i>Romanticism</i>. I curse, but then use the containment field Romanticism
because at times labelling is convenient, even necessary. And yet I
must continue to argue what a disaster has become of herding the
ghosts of my heroes onto some latter-day scholar&rsquo;s stage, a Fata
Morgana that really never existed as all the pendants want it to
have. Again, gripping butterflies squashes them.<label id='fnr.96' for='fnr-in.96.6321494' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>96</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.96.6321494' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>96</sup>
Again, Friedrich Schlegel first used <i>romantic</i> in contrast to
<i>classic</i> to describe what they were doing in Jena, but it wasn&rsquo;t
until the 1820s until the term Romanticism became widely known and
used.
</span> Right. We
shall use the term carefully&#x2026;

<p>
Academe wants Romanticism a spirited anti-rationalist (disrational,
irrational?), predominantly youthful <i>revolt</i> against the soulless
straitjacket of Enlightenment logic, as well as against stodgy,
urban-centric classicism&#x2014;basically anything coming before. Like
hallucinating AI chatbots, scholars tangle bundles of cords and wires,
connecting up Descartes, Rousseau, the French Revolution, Defoe,
Shakespeare,<label id='fnr.98' for='fnr-in.98.1667169' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>98</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.98.1667169' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>98</sup>
From the outset, the Schlegels in Jena made Shakespeare a
principal proto-Romanticist, Ludwig Tieck and others of the Jena Set
feverishly translating his plays into German. For me this was a clear
sign they were on the wrong road. I will eventually have my fictional
character from my novel tell you why.
</span> &#x2026; Buddha, Jesus, Merlin, the pope, et cetera, et
cetera &#x2026; a massive grid of vertices and edges spreading out over the
near as well as distant past, the more massive the better. But of
course all of this microscopic literary DNA matching is happening long
after the fact in a modern realism setting, separate,
aloof&#x2014;clueless.
</p>

<p>
Always their usual suspects roundup&#x2014;anachronistically-tagged

So convenient that Jena Romanticism came about in a for its
timey conspicuously free-wheeling university town, many of the Jena Set
lecturers and professors at the University of Jena.
</span> And so Novalis&rsquo; <i>poetising</i>, where the mundane is
flipped mysterious sacred and the sacred flipped ordinary profane,
becomes a formulaic lab procedure conducted by contrarian
irrationalists, rather than visionaries spinning gold out of
trances. The upshot is, an artistic paper airplane floating around on
feelings and emotions was folded and set sailing. Isaiah Berlin
described Romanticism as
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a new and restless spirit, seeking <i>violently</i> to burst through old
and cramping forms,<label id='fnr.100' for='fnr-in.100.8476467' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>100</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.100.8476467' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>100</sup>
&#x2026;my italics&#x2026;
</span></li>
<li>a <i>nervous</i> preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of
consciousness,</li>
<li>a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual
movement and change,</li>
<li>an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life,</li>
<li>a <i>passionate</i> effort at self-assertion both individual and
collective,</li>
<li>a search after means of expressing an <i>unappeasable yearning for
unattainable goals</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Especially the last point makes my heroes sound like children who want
everything in the candy shop.<label id='fnr.101' for='fnr-in.101.7279737' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>101</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.101.7279737' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>101</sup>
What would the esteemed Oxford professor say after following
an aboriginal witchdoctor around for a few days? Something very
similar, I dare say.
</span> More discerning, an
intentionality is implied which my principals most certainly did not
bring&#x2014;leading us once more to the disjunction between latter-day
professional analysts and the original grave-mute creators. But then
the question Berlin raised at the beginning of his <i>The Roots of
Romanticism</i>, namely, whether this was really a movement at all&#x2014;or
just a collective condition, a state of mind that is always &ldquo;in the
air,&rdquo; to emerge and then fade like virtual quantum particles blinking
in and out of existence.
</p>

<p>
But again my main question: Where is Dark in any academe Romanticism?
And no, I don&rsquo;t mean campy pop gothic. The feelings and emotions
Haworth Emily describe in <i>Fall leaves fall</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br>
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
do not appear in any known academic treatment of Romanticism, forcing
me through this manifesto to start over from scratch. Again, <i>Emily is
not just flipping!</i> When I read these lines, yes, they are words
processed by my brain&rsquo;s logical language model, but then they go to
feelings. This is a quasi-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron">mirror neuron</a> &ldquo;yes, I feel this way too&rdquo;
moment that gives me pause and transports me once again to the gates
of the Dark Muse. <i>Fall leaves fall</i> is terminal&#x2014;I imbibe, feel, and
go forth, i.e., I <i>behold</i> all this sublime ideation of darkness and
allow it to carry me&#x2014;and that&rsquo;s it! Haworth Emily infects me with
contagion, and I too smile and sing along with her.
</p>

<p>
We all follow logically-set plans in our lives, locigally-derived
&ldquo;goals.&rdquo; But we are always emotional, constantly assessing how we feel
about this or that, things in general. This is what I might call the
<i>logic train</i> and the <i>emotion braid</i>. Then when I read <i>Fall leaves
fall</i> my braid of emotions stretching back to my birth swells and
lifts me beyond my mundane, deterministic logic train. And it is
exactly this mirroring and swelling that academe doesn&rsquo;t get. Wreathes
of snow and night&rsquo;s decay obscure, impede my clear, well-lit logic
track.<label id='fnr.102' for='fnr-in.102.2332334' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>102</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.102.2332334' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>102</sup>
Folk psychology: All twisted (sic), screwed-up people have
this in common: They&rsquo;ve attempted to wall off some strand or cut out a
section of their emotion braid.
</span> And so when dealing with academe&rsquo;s cutting around on
Romanticism I must, as Amherst Emily said, <i>beware of the surgeon with
his knife, lest he find the culprit life</i>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org08be966" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org08be966">Nature reduced to sentimentality and innocence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org08be966">
<p>
The indoorsmen of academe never fail to raise <i>nature</i> up as a
hallmark of Romanticism. Nature, nature, nature they repeat&#x2014;but with
only the most patronising view of what it meant to my
principals. Nature what? Nature awareness, appreciation, adulation,
respect, idealisation, idolisation, rapture, fervour, worship? Nature
as a metaphor supply closet, a source of inspiration, a cruel
mistress, a loving mother. All of this gets batted around endlessly,
again, making my principals seem soppy, dreamy, sentimental, their
lines see-through by modernist grownups.
</p>

<p>
Academe&rsquo;s favourite Romanticism nature boy is of course William
Wordsworth, whom so many call Romanticism&rsquo;s godfather<label id='fnr.103' for='fnr-in.103.9130669' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>103</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.103.9130669' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>103</sup>
&#x2026;due to ignorance of Novalis? Alas&#x2026;
</span>&#x2014;but
then routinely pan as sappy sentimental. Beholden to the modern age
<i>and</i> its urban nihilist public, not to mention peer reviewers,
academe would see modern realist writers such as Jack London and
Ernest Hemingway in possession of more objective and unvarnished, more
<i>true</i> nature. What Wordsworth said about wandering like a cloud then
going nuts over daffodils is curious but affected mushy maudlin to
them.
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
That floats on high o&rsquo;er vales and hills,<br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br>
<br>
Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
They stretched in never-ending line<br>
Along the margin of a bay:<br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br>
<br>
The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
A poet could not but be gay,<br>
In such a jocund company:<br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>
<br>
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
And dances with the daffodils.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Eye rolls, smirks, and tsk-tsking in today&rsquo;s English department
classrooms. The richer his waxing, the further he sinks into
patronisation and condemnation by modern realists. Missed entirely is
his subtle and sublime. Here from <i>Lines Written a Few Miles above
Tintern Abbey</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,<br>
In which the burthen of the mystery,<br>
In which the heavy and the weary weight<br>
Of all this unintelligible world,<br>
Is lightened:&#x2014;that serene and blessed mood,<br>
In which the affections gently lead us on,&#x2014;<br>
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame<br>
And even the motion of our human blood<br>
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep<br>
In body, and become a living soul:<br>
While with an eye made quiet by the power<br>
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,<br>
We see into the life of things.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This of course is genial and goes to the heart and soul of what I want
to bring forth here at WutheringUK, even though he hadsn&rsquo;t included
Dark. He puts words to the deep and constant vibrations of my emotion
braid. But again, all this goes way above heads and contrary to
agendae today.<label id='fnr.104' for='fnr-in.104.7949751' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>104</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.104.7949751' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>104</sup>
A scholar mentioned in the Wikipedia articles says,
<i>[Wordsworth manages] to see into the life of things only &rsquo;by
narrowing and skewing his field of vision&rsquo; and by excluding &rsquo;certain
conflictual sights and meanings&rsquo;</i>. Obviously Wordsworth was a male
apologist for the capitalist industrialist patriarchy, ignoring that so
very many women and minorities were being oppresses exactly as he saw
those sights and penned those lines&#x2026;
</span> And so Wordsworth is just a dusty old statue
glimpsed during a quick run-through the classic wing of a museum, more
interesting, better things in the modern wing for sure.
</p>

<p>
Worse, Wordsworth made nature the only possible house for human purity
and innocence. How droll. In <i>To a Highland Girl</i> he transforms a
peasant shepherdess he saw on a trip to Scotland into a goddess
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;With earnest feeling I shall pray<br>
For thee when I am far away:<br>
For never saw I mien, or face,<br>
In which more plainly I could trace<br>
Benignity and home-bred sense<br>
Ripening in perfect innocence.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I guess you had to have been there. Again, as William lit up my
emotion bundle I was.
</p>

<p>
And so nature is never more than a <i>theme</i>, a <i>leitmotif</i>&#x2014;bereft of
any clue as to what Nature capitalised meant.<label id='fnr.105' for='fnr-in.105.7102397' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>105</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.105.7102397' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>105</sup>
&#x2026;and certainly no inkling of what I spoke of above about the
modern indoor-outdoor dichotomy being irrelevant.
</span> Nature conducive
to feelings and innocence, as so much of Romanticist poetry is someone
describing what they <i>feel</i> and <i>yearn</i> while in <i>nature</i>. Especially
with the Romanticist bond between feelings and nature do we see
academe as scoffers and put-down artists.
</p>




<p>
If one rejects metaphysics in all forms, then Nature is without
magic.<label id='fnr.106' for='fnr-in.106.7179767' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>106</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.106.7179767' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>106</sup>
So ironic how <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)">naturalism</a></i> means nature sans any metaphysics,
completely materialist mechanistic from the micro to the macro. Though
the term has the feel of instinctive, genuine, candid, sincere, e.g.,
the smile of a dear friend&#x2026; Woe. Alas.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Often, Nature is simply reverently noted in verse, as does Anne Brontë
in her <i>Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
My soul is awakened, my spirit is soaring<br>
And carried aloft on the wings of the breeze;<br>
For above and around me the wild wind is roaring,<br>
Arousing to rapture the earth and the seas.<br>
<br>
The long withered grass in the sunshine is glancing,<br>
The bare trees are tossing their branches on high;<br>
The dead leaves beneath them are merrily dancing,<br>
The white clouds are scudding across the blue sky<br>
<br>
I wish I could see how the ocean is lashing<br>
The foam of its billows to whirlwinds of spray;<br>
I wish I could see how its proud waves are dashing,<br>
And hear the wild roar of their thunder to-day!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I will posit that my principals were instinctively unknowingly,
belatedly stamping a new European nature worship out of the moors and
forest floors&#x2014;necessarily independent of whatever had been the
vernacular paganisms before Roman occupation. Orthogonal as well to
Elizabethan pastoral lyric, German <i>Shepherd Poetry</i> of the
post-Thirty Years War seventeenth century, or even the Greek Arcadian
<i>Bucolic</i> tradition.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Nature, but again, capitalised. Then we must explore&#x2014;probably
for the rest of our lives&#x2014;how very nuanced their Nature was. Here is
a quote from Haworth Emily
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All creation is equally mad. Nature is an inexplicable problem; it
exists on a principle of destruction. Every being must be the tireless
instrument of death to others, or itself must cease to live. Yet
nonetheless we celebrate the day of our birth, and we praise God for
having entered such a world.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Below I will dive into the three poems which I believe describe her
credo cosmology best. And, again, her Nature is completely different
from any modern ideas thereof.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org507ae8f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org507ae8f">Sensitivity</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org507ae8f">
<p>
Academe wants my principals to have been more in tune with their
senses, more impulsive, less emotionally structured, even sensual. But
once more their approach comes off as patronising, like child
psychologists trying to describe children at play. The doctors know
&ldquo;unruly&rdquo; won&rsquo;t do, so they euphemize cleverly. To be sure, they just
don&rsquo;t get what it is to be instinctual. And as ivory tower residents
embedded securely in society, they cannot fathom being an <i>outsider</i>,
neither physically nor social-psychologically. Tragic how one sort of
gifted, analytical intellectual, is largely unable to fathom another
sort of gifted&#x2014;artistic lyrical spiritual.
</p>

<p>
In general, academe lacks first-hand experience of what outsiders, the
disadvantaged have of the real world. This dearth of experience is not
made up by imagining the dehumanising and ultimately <i>desensitising</i>
waves coming at, say, the Brontës, the rumour of human exploitation,
the colonialism and capitalist industrialism. Though academe is master
of paradigms and movements, making the backdrop of Enlightenment&rsquo;s
cold, relentless dynamism and reductionist determinism hardly
oppressive, especially some two hundred years in the past. In short
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It takes a poet to know a poet, and it takes a special,
time-travelling poet to know these special Romantic Era poets.

<p>
Am I, your guide, a poet? Here&rsquo;s something I wrote
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
And from bygone generations I have surely more than blood.<br>
The loom, the wrapped bolt a shared past, holds me taunt.<br>
And try though I may, little hope there is finding out,<br>
Capturing this force of past souls and blood.<br>
For no sooner is some design of<br>
Art, music, words offered than opens<br>
A far greater twilit space echoing the past.<br>
Alas, that these modern conceits must all fail us;<br>
For the Muses range far above, behind, and beyond&#x2014;<br>
From the heart out to the eternal sea, sky, land,<br>
And everywhere and forever between,<br>
Subtle to mystical to rapturous.<br>
<br>
Woe, the tarried songbird whose weakening wings<br>
In late November portend death’s evening hour,<br>
Life’s requisite warmth finally dissipated,<br>
Her once vast blue space closing dark,<br>
The mysterious frontiers setting up,<br>
The shadowy boundary closing&#x2026;<br>
<br>
That we humans may touch,<br>
Stroke the dark velvet curtains<br>
Long before we slip the concealed gaps.<br>
Death would have all such anticipation quiet&#x2014;<br>
All suppositions. vain assurances flashing then quit,<br>
All expectations rattling, echoing lastly towards stillness<br>
Leaving friends to carry on in dutiful remembrance,<br>
That those, at graveside, must as best they can<br>
Face the darkness and resolutely reach out<br>
Beyond the day’s anguish and sadness<br>
To God and the bless&rsquo;d everlasting.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I think this might have got me an honourable mention back in the day.
</p>

<p>
And yet there&rsquo;s was no political polemic intended; rather, by trying
to re-humanise, <i>re-sensitise</i>, à la Novalis&rsquo; poetising, theirs was a
more Zen approach, a <i>Euro-Zen</i> perhaps. And so I re-collect Feeling,
Nature, and Euro Zen re-sensitisation. But then Romanticism is not
formulaic prescriptive. It is not a political or religious movement,
not a lifestyle &#x2026; what then?<label id='fnr.107' for='fnr-in.107.6177271' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>107</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.107.6177271' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>107</sup>

<h4 id="org981c191">Zen: East and West</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org981c191">
<p>
As a teen growing up in the early 1970s, I, like everyone around me,
fell in love with the magical, mysterious TV series <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_(1972_TV_series)">Kung Fu</a></i>
(premiere 1972). For a kid in Tennessee it was a pop introduction to
Eastern religion and philosophy. The main character Kwai Chang Caine
was a Chinese-American orphan raised in a Chinese Shaolin Buddhist
monastery in the mid-1800s who as a young man escaped China to America
after killing an aristocrat. Caine was taught the Kung Fu martial arts
style, but also the whole Buddhist pacifist, non-resistant approach to
life, both of which he uses, episode after episode, as he roams about
the wild west as an aesthete itinerant.
</p>

<p>
I recall getting a book on Zen Buddhism at that time wherein I found
the concept of <i>Unsui</i>, which is Japanese and means <i>cloud,
water</i>. The term refers to a novice monk
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In Japan, one receives unsui ordination at the beginning of formal
ordained practice, and this is often perceived as &rsquo;novice ordination.&rsquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My dense, written-for-adults book further described unsui
metaphorically, saying water may change states if impeded: as steam it
escapes heat; as water it goes around impediments or, if dammed,
simply waits patiently; if frozen, likewise, waits&#x2014;for nothing can
stop its eventual movement to the sea.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Kung Fu</i> story begins with Caine as a young man killing a
nobleman who has senselessly killed his temple master. Which of course
is the antithesis of the Buddhist way; hence, Caine must leave the
monastery. But this extreme pacifism is arguably a form of nihilism,
or existential meaninglessness, as in, What does it take to get you to
respond, kid? Caine momentarily stepped out of the nihilism and broke
the spell.
</p>

<p>
Contrast this with something Emily Brontë said in a diary
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All creation is equally mad. Nature is an inexplicable problem; it
exists on a principle of destruction. Every being must be the tireless
instrument of death to others, or itself must cease to live. Yet
nonetheless we celebrate the day of our birth, and we praise God for
having entered such a world.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, both Eastern philosophies and my Brontëan English Zen do not
confront the real world with socio-political doctrine or
manifestos. But then where does Buddhism take us? Where does Brontëan
Zen take us?
</p>

<p>
Buddhism wants enlightenment&#x2014;which supposedly raises us to some sort
of extra-human demi-angel. Once enlightened, we no longer have worldly
cares. But how many actually reach this state which we might guess is
some permanent version of Dostoyevski&rsquo;s presence of eternal harmony?
This is why I cannot take any sort of Eastern religion based on
enlightenment seriously, since such a very limited number of people
ever arrive at this self-actualization.
</p>

<p>
But then what of West Zen? Emily Brontë&rsquo;s <i>All creation is equally
mad&#x2026;</i> presents a deep paradox and falls into fatalism, rather than
offering a path to anything higher. How could poetised
feelings&#x2014;Longfellow&rsquo;s piteous ruing of snowflakes, Poe&rsquo;s overnights
at the sepulchre by the sea, Novalis&rsquo; shout-outs to the night&#x2014;sit
atop all the violent dynamism, all the smashing, banging, clanging of
theirs or our times? How was so-called Romanticism even to be
considered the aesthetics of, the contemporary cultural offerings to
such great upheaval, coercion, destruction as came upon the
nineteenth-century West? The initial answer is no, it could not
be. There could be no artistic, aesthetic compliment to colonialism,
Newtonian science, and industrialism. And therein lies so much of the
irony and paradox. How could The British Empire rising to the height
of its power and reach make William &ldquo;Dances With Daffodils&rdquo; Wordsworth
its poet laureate?<label id='fnr.108' for='fnr-in.108.6775791' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>108</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.108.6775791' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>108</sup>
&#x2026;named in 1843.
</span> No, what the Romantic Era poets and artists
created was, as we might categorise (sic) it, a very <i>underground</i>
aesthetic, an anti-movement that blanched and faded in the light of
day. The <i>radical philosophers</i>, as the proto-Marxist activists were called
by some, were about power and wealth, i.e., the haves versus the
have-nots. Marxist dialectics then said when the gradient is too great
necessarily the revolution will begin. Grim was the new industrial
urban, the largely subsistence peasants now wage slaves living in
existential terror of squalor, hunger, and exploitation. <i>Homo homini
lupus</i><label id='fnr.109' for='fnr-in.109.5266294' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>109</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.109.5266294' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>109</sup>
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_homini_lupus">Man is a wolf to man</a></i>.
</span> had once again raised its terrible head in a new and
awful way.
</p>

<p>
Here we might suggest classicism as a better choice for Western
civilization. Classicism would seem to better compliment imperialism,
as in &ldquo;See the wonderful omelette? Now forget all the eggs we broke to
make it.&rdquo; Glory, majesty, splendor, regality, grandeur to justify,
substantiate whatever terrible happenings on the frontiers enabled
it. Or perhaps the classicist envelope around religion, elevating the
huge paradox of meek, pious, pacifist Christianity as a
stop-at-nothing empire&rsquo;s real humanistic intention. As phenomena go,
Romanticism was not to be had, full stop.
</p>

<p>
The Brontë sisters languished (or blossomed?) in obscurity most of
their lives,<label id='fnr.110' for='fnr-in.110.1065177' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>110</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.110.1065177' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>110</sup>
&#x2026;and they were routinely left out of academic analysis of
Romanticism, e.g., Abrams&rsquo; <i>The Mirror and the Lamp</i>, Beach&rsquo;s <i>The
Concept of Nature in Nineteenth-Century English Poetry</i>, and Berlin&rsquo;s
<i>The Roots of Romanticism</i> make no mention of them! Maybe they had
read <a href="https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Bronte-upload-4.pdf">Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s comments on <i>Jane Eyre</i></a> and gave them up for a
bad job. See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/19/virginia-woolf-in-bronte-country-jane-eyre">this analysis</a> as well. Big cringe&#x2026;
</span> but as they gained popular recognition in the
latter half of the eighteenth century, they and other Victorian
Neo-Romanticisms kept on portraying a softer, kinder England from the
capitalist industrialist, imperialist militarist reality. Consider the
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (founded in 1848). Below is a later
painting of John Everett Millais, <i>An Idyll of 1745</i>
</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Everett_Millais#/media/File:An_Idyll_of_1745_(Millais).jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./images/Millais AnIdyllof1745.jpg" width="780" alt="Millais Idyll"></a>
<span class="cap">Before YouTube and hysterical helicopter parents...</span>

<p>
Millais is dealing in profane or vulgar nostalgia,<label id='fnr.111' for='fnr-in.111.4693705' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>111</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.111.4693705' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>111</sup>
&#x2026;as opposed to <i>sacred</i> nostalgia, i.e., a heartfelt hearkening,
yearning for the profound eternal and epic, which should not be
dependent on context or seen as escapism to the past.
</span> an
associativity we today cannot totally follow without flawed
speculation. Of course Britain in 1745 was powerful after favourable
political events (e.g., Treaty of Utrecht) and Robert Walpole&rsquo;s era as
the first prime minister. It might be said that a new era of decadence
had arrived, and yet 1745 was the year of the main Jacobite rebellion;
hence, the patriotic theme. But this was not dominant domineering
Britain yet, rather, a Britain still fighting and scrapping for its
position in the world, mainly against the French, as well as still
suffering the collective PTSD of the bloody seventeenth-century
British civil wars less than a hundred years earlier. And yet Millais
painting this in 1884 would hearkened back, however vulgarly, to, yes,
an <i>idyllic</i> time&#x2014;at least as he thought provided by the seemingly
eternal English countryside, Britain&rsquo;s first and foremost national
treasure. Three innocent, tabula rasa peasant girls are enraptured by
an enlisted man playing a flute while a fatherly high-born officer
looks on admiringly. Clearly, this pastoral bliss is a version of
Britain longed for by the nostalgia-heavy, Romanticism-influenced
Pre-Raphaelites. Great rueing and regretting permeated Victorian
parlour society, spurring them to revive the earlier Romantic Era and
to see in nature vitality and salvation. See beside as well Millais&rsquo;
<i>The Blind Girl</i>.<label id='fnr.112' for='fnr-in.112.7406641' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>112</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.112.7406641' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>112</sup>

</span> This was the England they wanted, and not the
bloody savagery of colonialism imperialism, nor the horrific suffering
of the urban industrial wastelands Charles Dickens came to chronicle.
</p>

<p>
No
more that Christianity before it could.
</p>

<p>
Romanticism portrayed as a furtherance of Enlightenment freedom of
expression is also farcical. See how eighteenth-century gothic doom
paralleled the beginning of the Industrial Revolution&rsquo;s inflexion
point, as well as the reverberations of colonialism, e.g.,
slavery. Doom, where sins&rsquo; ever compounded interest smashed any
profits, gains. Dynasties subject to Old Testament&rsquo;s crashing woe.

<p>
Perhaps my Romantic Era principals sensed the hyper-individualistic
reptilian mindset from the middle-class capitalist
industrialists<label id='fnr.113' for='fnr-in.113.7085189' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>113</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.113.7085189' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>113</sup>
The typical middle-class industrialist coming up during the
Enlightenment was a pragmatic utilitarian who, after absorbing the
message of Adam Smith&rsquo;s <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> (1776), had jettisoned
the baggage of noblesse oblige, the New Testament beatitudes, and any
lingering other-century nostalgia and sentimentality to forge ahead as
the consummate self-reliant individualist laser-focused on financial
wealth. These men projected a stripped-down emotional psychological
persona, indeed, a new desensitisation regime.
</span> as a egregious desensitisation regime spreading
throughout society, and threw a re-sensitisation at it.
</p>



<p>
Marxism dispenses with aesthetics, while my principals could not do
without an aesthetical foundation&#x2014;and then only adorned said
foundation with poetisings. And of course there was no &ldquo;call to action.&rdquo;
</p>


<p>
There is something instinctual in my eschewing of Eastern as a Dark Muser. Why
do I cleave to Emily Brontë&rsquo;s English Zen and revolt against all the
westernised Buddhism?<label id='fnr.114' for='fnr-in.114.95192' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>114</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.114.95192' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>114</sup>
I say &ldquo;westernised Eastern&rdquo; because we in the West cannot
possibly know what real Eastern is, not being genetically or
culturally truly Eastern. We only think we can rationalise the
irrational number Eastern.
</span>
</p>


<p>
No, my principle principals
</p>

<p>
Here I will simply and plainly state that I believe Emily Jane Brontë
was the very centre, the utter culmination of the whole Romanticism
thing&#x2014;ironically <span class="underline">the most outside</span> of any Romanticism boxing or
packaging by academe. She combined in her <i>poetry</i><label id='fnr.115' for='fnr-in.115.7338460' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>115</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.115.7338460' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>115</sup>
Again, let&rsquo;s forget her book <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, which for me
is just gothic novel handle-cranking, however artistically potent. As
before, I suspect an inevitable inability for prose to do what poetry
does. Likewise, Poe lost much altitude when he would switch from
poetry to prose. That is to say, Brontë and Poe said deep and lasting
things in their verse, but simply added pulp to the gothic novel shelf
with their prose.

<p>
Both <i>Dickinson</i> and <i>Emily</i> are completely cringe unwatchable, but
worse by far is the all but demonic inhabitation of Emily Dickinson
unfolding in the three-season, thirty episode AppleTV+ series
<i>Dickinson</i>. Apparently, the real Amherst Emily said something
affectionate in a letter to a female friend&#x2014;which opened the door
for screenwriter Alena Smith to reinvent the shy, gentle, reclusive,
homebody, proto-nerd-girl Emily Elizabeth as a brassy, braying,

outta-control, hyper-sexual protest-lesbian victim martyr. And so this

for three years, spread over thirty episodes of crashing, crypto-rebel
poser effrontery, even winning a Peabody, among other, &ldquo;awards.&rdquo; As the
wincing Wikipedia article, which categorises it as a &ldquo;comic-drama,&rdquo;
(sic) says
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Dickinson</i> is notable for its use of anachronisms, incorporating
modern language, music, and references into its portrayal of
historical events and figures.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#x2026;quite possibly the understatement of all time. It also states
<i>Dickinson</i> is &ldquo;a window into the cultural and political climate of
the time.&rdquo;  Really. It is nothing of the sort, rather, a whole-cloth
reinvention based on radical, male-hating, misanthropic,
twenty-first-century agitprop feminism, full stop. If conspiracy
theories about &ldquo;cultural Marxism&rdquo; were ever to be taken serious, this
would be Exhibit A.<label id='fnr.116' for='fnr-in.116.3904119' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>116</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.116.3904119' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>116</sup>
Not only is Emily Dickinson trashed, they trash other big
names of the American Romantic Era. Try <a href="https://youtu.be/3tO8ol9j34s?si=DQifICJs3tJgpi9O">this</a>, then
<a href="https://youtu.be/LmneLDB6hAI?si=sSef_hvjshiTbV1b">this</a>. Crrringe&#x2026; And just when you thought it couldn&rsquo;t get worse,
<a href="https://youtu.be/pFp05alGLow?si=tTk-5CPhmpdkeQ3R">this music videos</a> by the actress portraying Emily Dickinson is
attached to the series as its supposed theme song. Alas&#x2026;

More innocuous perhaps, simply because it is a single film lasting
only two hours thus not able to get up to as much inanity as
<i>Dickinson</i>, is the Hollywood <i>Emily</i>.<label id='fnr.117' for='fnr-in.117.6552547' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>117</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.117.6552547' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>117</sup>
Emily Brontë as a modern &ldquo;cottagecore emo girl&rdquo; per <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2023/02/emily-bronte-movie-true-story-wuthering-heights.html">this</a> Slate
review. No need to watch, just read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_(2022_film)#Plot">the plot</a> for full cringe. <br>

</span> This train wreck depicts
Haworth Emily, the woman I consider the greatest, deepest
English-language poet, as a clumsy, oafish maladroit, stumbling around
in a completely anachronistic period fantasy chaos. Enough said.
</p>

<p>
I hemmed and hawed over this bit of electron savagery directly above,
but seriously, there can be <i>zero</i> buy-in to this sort of nonsense if
we are to get anywhere near understanding the true nature of these
special people.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, modern leftist polemicists are forever latching onto some
defenceless figure in the past to reimagine as their pet visionary
radicals. And so any gifted unicorn from yesteryear who might have the
least bit chafed at society&rsquo;s eternal(ly shifting, reforming)
containment fields is available for reintroduction reconstitution as
some modern hack&rsquo;s proto-revolutionist. Sad.
</p>

<p>
Contrast with the 2011 <i>Jane Eyre</i> where the modernist triumphalist
nonsense is kept to a minimum. In this umpteenth filming of the
Charlotte Brontë classic, there are two actual prayer scenes!
</p>

<p>
Of course the audio-visual medium of
film is fraught
</p>

<p>
Modern desensitisation as the answer to everything.
</p>

<p>
First and foremost, we must accept the social-political landscape of
those times. 
</p>

<p>
Christianity simply was a given in both of their lives. It was their
metaphysical foundation and was largely accepted by both Emilies, in
fact, often poetised.
</p>



<p>
Today we shamble about in a political fog that will have the Left not
wanting to believe anything good about the past, and the Right not
brooking anything bad about some golden era in their imaginations. The
Left is arguably everything Noam Chomsky had bad to say about French
intellectualism, now conveniently packaged as <i>cultural Marxism</i>, and
the Right an amalgamation of conservative and, newly,
libertarianism.<label id='fnr.118' for='fnr-in.118.9962660' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>118</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.118.9962660' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>118</sup>
I contend libertarianism is simply a new form of liberalism,
i.e., liberalism has gotten so big that leftism no longer is big
enough to contain it all.
</span>
</p>

<p>
To understand my principals we must suspend any and all revisionist
wishful thinking.

One of my earliest brushes with Dostoevski&rsquo;s <i>presence of eternal
harmoy</i> came to me on a Halloween night back when I was a little boy
in a small Southern Illinois town. We were trick-or-treating on our
street, the oldest neighborhood in town with Victorians, cobblestone,
and gas streetlights. At some point I felt like I had left the present
and entered another dimension, a nighttime fairy forest of bare
trees. Everything was magical, and yet as a child not completely
disabused of magic, I didn&rsquo;t think anything was too out of the
ordinary. I distinctly remember looking up into the dense, bare
branches of a huge old oak and seeing the moon looking in and out of
crossing clouds and feeling like I was a spirit entered another
world. 
</p>

<p>
I live in the far-northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called North
Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, just before the
Canadian border. This so-called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region">Arrowhead Region</a>&rdquo; holds some three
million-plus acres of wilderness on the shores of the world&rsquo;s largest
body (by surface area) of freshwater. And to my mind, this is a very
Dark Muse kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, I cannot
go. Pictures may be worth a thousand words, but our Dark vibe here
must be experienced to be really appreciated. And I still see this
other world of shadow and magic as I often look out at my moonlit
<i>Inland Sea</i> over the treetops of dark spruce and gnarled, bare
aspen.
</p>

<p>
Again, I&rsquo;m wont to call Lake Superior the <i>Inland Sea</i>,<label id='fnr.119' for='fnr-in.119.8120392' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>119</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.119.8120392' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>119</sup>
Really though, calling it <i>Lake</i> Superior is
like calling Einstein a high school graduate.
</span> thus,
North Coast instead of North Shore. Indeed, she is so much more
sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is something much
smaller and much friendlier. The Inland Sea is big and often violent
like any sea or ocean of saltwater. She&rsquo;s no simple lake for
beer-and-brats picnickers, windsurfers, speedboat and jet ski
riffraff<label id='fnr.120' for='fnr-in.120.9577920' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>120</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.120.9577920' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>120</sup>
Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her longer than
ten minutes can lead to hypothermia &#x2026; at least on the North
Coast. Though the south beaches of Wisconsin and Michigan can be
swimmable in the height of summer.
</span>. To be sure, she has a mighty présence, often dark and
moody if not threatening.
</p>

<p>
Often a deep moodiness prevails. Here is nothing really spectacular in
the sense of the Great Outdoors overwhelming with one postcard vista
after another&#x2014;as we think of the American West and Alaska. Rather,
here is more subtlety, more reserve, thus more mood.
</p>

<p>
Though I feel quite alone here in this assessment. My little village,
Grand Marais, the county seat, is only some thirteen hundred
souls. And yet as the years go by we are becoming evermore
suburban-like in mentality. Being a popular Northern Midwest resort
town, we have a steady stream of newcomers who increasingly are not
adapting to small-town life; instead, maintaining their aloof,
disengaged, emotionally unavailable, blinkered urban-suburban ways. So
often one encounters another supposed fellow human&#x2014;only to receive
the &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t exist&rdquo; treatment common on a street in Manhattan.
</p>

<p>
Another social-psychology pitfall is how many people came up from a
Chicago or especially Twin Cities suburb ostensibly to reinvent
themselves. They&rsquo;ve made the leap out of the sterile, soulless
clone-bunny suburbia to now be some new version of themselves. They
typically use Hemingway and Jack London, i.e., a macho attitude about
wilderness and what I call this <i>Neo-Klondikism</i>. This is totally
different from the real pioneers of late nineteenth, early twentieth
centuries who brought Victorian civilization to the wilderness.
</p>

<p>
Because the spectacular is mostly blazingly lit, our dearth of
spectacular allows the night to come up alongside.

Grand Marais is my &ldquo;sepulchre by the sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here&rsquo;s a few lines I once wrote after a late-autumn hike
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Mists race westward through the surrounding spruce forest. The entire ridge enveloped in snow clouds, light failing, the Western Hemisphere’s greatest inland sea—four miles South and seven-hundred feet below—totally obscured. Sleet falls fast and hard, stinging my face; my eyes cannot fully focus; though I hear the wind through the coated trees, the distant sound of the invisible waves, crashing angrily against the rocks. . . . I have come the four miles from the town, up the wet, slippery trail, up through the darkening forest, to pay homage to this late autumn wonderland. The Dark Muse is strong.
	I, the Modern, wear a Gore-tex jacket, over a Merino wool top, over a silk base layer. I wear black lycra tights, thin gloves with padded biking gloves on top in case of a fall. I wear special minimalist moccasins made to simulate barefoot running. I am out to face the age-old elements hiding behind modern accoutrements.
	I had contemplated walking rather than running, but no, darkness was too near and I had to reach the ridge-top ere dusk. I saw not a soul as I climbed the trail. I stopped at the ridge’s two main streams to witness their loud and clear coursing from all the new precipitation.
	It was all but dark when I set off from the cloud-bound ridge-top for the town again. The snow was accumulating in earnest, making downhill footing difficult. But as I say, the Muse was strong, and the growing darkness made it all the stronger.
