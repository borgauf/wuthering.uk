Light snow drifts gently down from the low clouds draped over a misty
boreal forest. Deer in their grey winter coats process through the fir
and spruce. Ravens and crows dolefully croak and caw back and
forth. And I burn a daytime candle. Such an ambience to convey my
thoughts, my impressions and <i>feelings</i> about my <i>Dark Muse</i>.<label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.7849163' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.7849163' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
<i>muse</i>: Originally any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts; <i>or</i> a state of
deep thought or abstraction, e.g., to enter a <i>muse</i> over a poem; <i>or</i>
a source of inspiration, e.g., <i>Jane Austen is my muse</i>.

Do you have an inexplicable fascination with things on the gloomy
side? You often find <i>dreamy</i> what others find <i>dreary</i> &#x2026; as when an
overcast day brings on a strangely sanguine melancholy &#x2026; or a stormy
night is magnificent in a frightening and thrilling sort of
way. Twilight is a welcome reprieve from the hectic, incessant day,
freeing your senses, calming, deepening your thoughts. You&rsquo;ve paused
to gaze transfixed upon a lonely, nondescript landscape, a wild,
deserted shore, an old, abandoned cemetery. Just like a decaying,
overgrown, other-century structure makes you envious of the bats
living there. Unnatural is having to get out of heat into air
conditioning and suffer through smalltalk while drinking iced
beverages; truer it seems to come inside out of the cold and sit by a
fire in a deep, shared silence drinking hot tea. Time and again what
they find uplifting is piteously trite out to ruefully disappointing
for you. Panic and nausea well up when attempts are made at
sunny-cheery; then being alone is a relief, not always lonely. What is
spectacular to them is suspect and eventually disappointing to you
&#x2026; whereas things subtle, veiled, shadowy tenuous, understated are
intriguing. Stirrings, please, but not shaking or slamming. Their
heroes grasp desperately at happy endings. Yours learn and grow from
facing grim and harsh&#x2014;and if it means succumbing to the thrashing,
amen, RIP,<label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.3277734' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.3277734' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., Lady Dedlock&rsquo;s death at the graveyard of her secret
lover in Dickens&rsquo; <i>Bleak House</i>.
</span> c&rsquo;est la vie, time for mourning black. Candlelight
over artificial light, wool over nylon, old architecture over new, the
genial disorder of wild nature over the forced containment of
gardens. If in a city, you can&rsquo;t stand anywhere but the oldest
quarters and big, old parks.  And yes, it might seem a bit to ask, but
wouldn&rsquo;t it be grand if every month we celebrated Halloween?&#x2026;  If yes
to any of this, you might understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say here.

I provide here a quote from Charlotte Brontë&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre">Jane Eyre: An
Autobiography</a></i>. Main protagonist Jane describes the house, called
simply Moor House, and environs of her adoptive family, the Rivers, on
the edge of the wild, presumably Yorkshire moors,<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.9790334' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.9790334' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
The word <i>moor</i> appears forty-three times in <i>Jane Eyre</i>. After
the second or third use, I was just putty in Charlotte&rsquo;s hands&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
They loved their sequestered home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique
structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering
walls, its avenue of aged firs&#x2014;all grown aslant under the stress of
mountain winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly&#x2014;and where no
flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom&#x2014;found a charm both
potent and permanent. They clung to the purple moors behind and around
their dwelling&#x2014;to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path
leading from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks
first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields
that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a
flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced
lambs&#x2014;they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of
attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
and sweep&#x2014;on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by
moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,
and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were
to them&#x2014;so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast
and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of
sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for
me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them&#x2014;wound round my
faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#x2026; <i>the consecration of its loneliness</i> indeed.<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.2856921' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.2856921' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
Here is what I might call an <i>English Zen</i>. More about EZ later.
</span> I often read
this passage just to muse upon the wistful, moody, delicately
melancholic intentionally anti-spectacular subtleties she
describes&#x2014;and how this and other choice moments set the whole tone
and mood of the book. Charlotte Brontë establishes light and dark as
equals, and then works expertly with the gradient there between. The
dim, the shadows, the dark, the harsh, even at times merciless
inclemencies are features not bugs. She does not suppress dark,
perhaps knowing that if it were seen an equal to light it would
eventually prove itself the older, wiser sibling capable of rich,
complimentary contributions. A notable gradient boon is how she has
the Moor House environs so very abandoned, lonely, thus ultra-wild
exactly because they are so unpresuming and overlooked, so bereft of
anything nature-spectacular &#x2026; as opposed to some breathtaking
primordial wilderness millions of miles away visited only by intrepid
explorers. Indeed, subtle and unassuming become the older, wiser
siblings of grand and spectacular. Notable too how Jane arrived at
Moor House&#x2014;half dead on her hands and knees, thus, adding complete
vulnerability to this sublime mix. And once recovered, she is still
every bit the underdog&#x2014;relative to us today in our
nature-domineering modern developed world. This point is key to what
I&rsquo;ll say later&#x2026;

Case in point: Consider the Great Smoky Mountains National Park high
on the Appalachian Mountains border of Tennessee and North
Carolina. The <i>Smokies</i> are a federally protected, quasi-pristine
wilderness of 522,419 acres, surrounded by lesser-protected though
still completely wilderness state and USDA National Forest lands
coming to another million or so acres. Statistics say the national
park itself is the most=visited of all U.S. national parks with nearly
fourteen million tourists per year,<label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.4993595' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.4993595' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
&#x2026;more than double the next most popular, the Grand Canyon&#x2026;
</span> with additional tourist
attractions and accommodations all around the park boundaries. And
what are these visitors doing? Only a small fraction are actually out
on the park&rsquo;s extensive wilderness trails hiking and camping. Most are
either driving the main dissecting highway connecting Tennessee to
North Carolina or simply crowding into the visitor centres per
automobile. I once visited on the Fourth of July, stopping in the main
tourist town Gatlinburg, Tennessee, where the sidewalks
standing-room-only. But later that same day I hiked for hours deep in
the park on the main Appalachian Trail and saw not another
human. Indeed. Strange as this may seem, I say Jane&rsquo;s Yorkshire
moorlands are real nature, while the Smokies cannot be simply because
of the sheer abstraction, the artificiality of their purpose, not to
mention their publicity throughout the entire world. The Smokies are
fussed and ruled over by armies of scientists and bureaucrats at the
behest of the U.S. Department of Interior National Park, UNESCO World
Heritage Site, International Biosphere Reserve, etc., like a great
research terrarium under an invisible glass dome. Even in the
remotest, genuinely wild spots, the weight of humanity&rsquo;s lurking
dominance, our collective mental presence is inescapably
massive&#x2026; And so we have the dichotomy of discovered and
undiscovered, exotic versus vernacular, integrated versus detached,
grounded versus transient, many versus no matches to googling. As the
Rivers&rsquo; guest, Jane describes a natural and organic connection to her
moorland, while no modern tourist can ever expect to be truly
integrated with the Great Smoky Mountains National Park complex.<label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.1716693' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.1716693' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
Perhaps give the Smokies a second chance by reading the
pre-park fictional work <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_(novel)">Christy</a></i> by Catherine Marshall. She captures
something that might be called <i>Appalachian Gothic</i>.

<h4 id="org7161a33">My Dark <i>penchant</i></h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7161a33">
<p>
Continuing, I am at a loss to explain my dark <i>penchant</i> to those who
do not, cannot, will not get it. Dark as I mean it is strictly a
take-it-or-leave-it proposition; one gets Dark<label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.9481302' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.9481302' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
Allow me the poetic emphasis device of capitalising nouns.
</span> or one does
not. Dark as I mean it was best presented by certain principle <b>poets</b>
of the early nineteenth-century <i>Romantic</i> Era,<label id='fnr.8' for='fnr-in.8.2232248' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.8.2232248' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup>
Quick preliminary, much more later: The term Romanticism
followed a twisted path beginning with the Latin <i>romant</i>, or, &ldquo;in the
Roman manner&rdquo;, thus, not at all our current use of the word as a
synonym of love. In general, bundling what I&rsquo;m trying to get at as
<i>Romanticism</i> is fraught to say the least. Academe wants to grip
butterflies, but when they open their hands there is only goo. Lots
more on this problem as we go&#x2026;
</span> an <i>emergent</i>
property, a very special private corner of this ultimately maligned
and misunderstood time. To be sure, best expressed is the Dark Muse in
poetry, while prose not so well. I, as well as many others of yore,
believe that lyrical poetry captures far more and drives far deeper
than whatever can be lined up in long chains of prose sentences. For
example, it is almost as if principal poetess Emily Dickinson used
words to mercilessly expose just how tenuous words really are. She
routinely made words give up their ghosts just to swap in even more
mysterious ghosts&#x2014;again, something best done with poetry. We&rsquo;ll
explore some of her wicked flights into <i>thoughts behind thoughts</i> as
we go. When you read my Amherst Emily haiku-like lines, think of Zen
koans for the Dark Muse.
</p>

<p>
I can only say my Dark Muse often comes on as a <i>feeling behind
feeling</i>, subtle, profound, yet fleeting, not hanging around for
pedantics&rsquo; tedious descriptions.<label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.8061131' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.8061131' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
One very important principal, the German poet <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novalis">Novalis</a> (penname
for Baron Friedrich von Hardenberg), often used his unique <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_fragment">fragment</a></i>
style to describe his Dark Muse. And so he abandoned even lyrical
poetry to get even more bursty, more spontaneous in order to capture
the subtleties of his impressions. Lots more about Novalis, the
presumed founder of German Romanticism, as we go along.
</span> Dark stirrings arrive mostly
unannounced, a veritable surprise. <b>Dark is a gift</b> for which one says
thank you and doesn&rsquo;t immediately Google Lens to see how much it
cost. Thus, my exploration of Dark will rely heavily on the poetry of
the preeminent Romantic Era champions of Dark Muse.

a few inches from the centre of the room. In very short, I believe
modern goths surely <i>sense</i> Dark,<label id='fnr.11' for='fnr-in.11.9214321' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.11.9214321' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup>
BTW, the Germans capitalise nouns, i.e., built-in poetic
emphasis.
</span> but for whatever reasons so
many of them only want to express it, explore it very narrowly through
goth music and fashion. My Dark Muse would hopefully include, be akin
to what is today called goth and gothic, <i>but I must go deeper and
more elemental</i>. If you are goth I hope you allow me to speak to your
&ldquo;inner goth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ll start by saying there is a <i>natural darkness</i> that Nature
provides, a basis upon which we may create symbols, artefacts, icons,
trappings to emulate, decorate, magnify, socialise, humanise, if
nothing else, <i>bring indoors</i> natural Dark. Yes to aesthetics as far
as they may resonate, do honour to Dark. But too often our human take
on Dark winds up overstated, overwrought&#x2014;all the way out to grimy,
ignoble, silly, scummy. We imbibe then express what we see,
experience, feel. But I say it must be done carefully, if not
respectfully. And so I must reject so many of the overdone <i>gothic</i>
horror fright memes, e.g., vampires, witches, demons; mean nasty
menacing this, threatening evil that. Right up front: My Dark is
not meant to shock or frighten, rather, invite, deepen, and enrich. My
Dark Muse contains nothing cruel nor evil nor sinister nor satanic. As
philosopher and psychologist John Vervaeke said in describing the
modern crisis of anxiety and dysphoria, &ldquo;Horror is the <i>aesthetic</i> of
when you feel like you&rsquo;re losing your grip on reality.&rdquo; Thus, I might
dip my toe in the lake of horror, as Alfred Hitchcock once said, but I
needn&rsquo;t dwell there too long. Mine is not the <i>Star Wars</i> &ldquo;dark side,&rdquo;
not dark barbarism à la <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, and not the psychic dark
described by Freud or Jung. I cringe when someone says, &ldquo;&#x2026;and then
things took a <i>dark</i> turn.&rdquo; In general
</p>

\begin{align*}
\large{\text{Dark} \ne \text{negative}}
\end{align*}

<p>
Again, campy, over-the-top gothic can be interesting, fun, but I&rsquo;d
rather not lose sight of the source, however obscure and rare it may
be.<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.1471703' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.1471703' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>
Yes, MHGA: Make Halloween Great Again <br>
<img src="images/Santos-Halloween-regular-Diamond.jpg" alt="Santos-Halloween-regular-Diamond.jpg"> <br>
<br>
</span> I&rsquo;m after something more subtle, discriminating,
inward-personal &#x2026; perhaps like the small natural sweet of a wild
strawberry versus the chemical sweet blast of saccharine &#x2026; natural
rather than manufactured. Great big point: <b>My Dark is about the
sublime</b>, indeed, <i>sublimity</i>. I will eventually deal with Edmund
Burke&rsquo;s (as well as Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s) false, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t get it at
all&rdquo; tedium on <i>sublimity</i> later. In the meantime, <i>sublime</i> is
basically what we may find beyond mere beauty, touching what
Dostoevsky is saying here
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are seconds, they only come five or six at a time, and you
suddenly feel the <b>presence of eternal harmony</b> (POEH) fully
achieved. It is nothing earthly; not that it is heavenly, but man
cannot endure it in his earthly state. One must change physically or
die. The feeling is clear and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense
the whole of nature and suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not
tenderheartedness, but simply joy.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Awe instead of joy? Again, much more fleshing out as we go along&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
And so I hearken back to a golden era when Dark was the cultural
currency, to be sure, the early nineteenth century, a time when my key
poets, my <i>principals</i> (e.g. Poe, Novalis, the Brontës) showed us how
triste and Stygian can be so very subtle and sublime. I&rsquo;m after
something <i>I will not outgrow</i>, rather, continue as my raison d&rsquo;être
sustaining me to my grave. And so I say there must be no &ldquo;aging out of
the scene&rdquo; as I fear often happens with modern goth.<label id='fnr.13' for='fnr-in.13.9670868' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.13.9670868' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup>
Why do people age out of goth? A crude answer may be they just
can&rsquo;t kick the rebel chic can down the beach any longer &#x2026; there, I
said it&#x2026;
</span> Rather, the Dark
Muse should be a deepening and widening and transcendence for one&rsquo;s
entire life.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf718da5">
<p>
Another ox gored is my rejection of modern dumbed-down American street
English, which has permeated modern society virtually
worldwide. Basically, I mean to sound more erudite, sophisticated,
intellectual with my use of past-century British-tinted English. Why?
Simply because the English of the early-nineteenth century was like a
thoroughbred race horse, sleek and powerful, capable of amazingly deep
and magical expression. Contrast this with beggared, destitute,
impoverished, needlessly retrenched modern American street English,
which requires a buy-in to a particularly base, ignorant, crude and
aggressive hipster Zeitgeist. Which I repudiate, not going
there. Although I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll occasionally slip up.<label id='fnr.14' for='fnr-in.14.2061938' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.14.2061938' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup>
Retrenchment towards what, exactly? Orwell&rsquo;s <i>1984</i>?
</span>
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, people were more genteel, thoughtful,
fine-spoken. Indeed, back when having character and honour, when
showing decorum and graciousness was a way of life. As a result, their
poetry could express the depths and heights of human thought and
sensitivities so much better.<label id='fnr.15' for='fnr-in.15.8196407' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.15.8196407' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>15</sup>
&#x2026;while so much of our modern poetry is screed doggerel. For
example, Allen Ginsberg acclaimed <i>Howl</i> is really social-political
pamphleteering in verse, not true poetry as it has been known for
centuries. And from there things go downhill fast&#x2014;into the most
ridiculous absurdist nihilist nonsense.
</span> In past centuries they understood
the human need for holiness, grandeur, the epic and eternal. I say all
of this is necessary to fully grasp their exquisite take on the Dark
Muse. Compare this with the crypto-rebel posers we see everywhere
today who believe being coarse, crass, base, irreverent&#x2014;and
arrogantly in-your-face about it&#x2014;is somehow progressive and
desirable&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But on the other hand, it might just be that I&rsquo;ve finally succumbed to
the influence of all those schoolmarms back in my distant 1950s-60s
childhood who made us read, e.g., Shakespeare and Hawthorn, all those
nearing-retirement throw-backs who held up &ldquo;wordy,&rdquo; other-century

For me life seems empty, insipid, weak, every moment rudderless,
misspent, crushingly mundane without a strong and constant current of
the Dark Muse. It is as if life cannot be properly understood without
the dark perspective. And then I wonder, <b>is this nature or nurture</b>?
That is to say, are we innately so, or is this something
acculturated?<label id='fnr.16' for='fnr-in.16.711221' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.16.711221' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup>

</span> I <i>feel</i> it is the former. One simply <i>feels</i>
the tug of Dark&#x2014;regardless of any sort of prepping or grooming. But
let&rsquo;s do another quick litmus test. I present here a short, simple
poem from my main darkness benefactress, the poetess who stands at the
centre of everything I mean to say about dark, namely, Emily Jane
Brontë<label id='fnr.17' for='fnr-in.17.3252421' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.17.3252421' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup>
Oddly enough, I&rsquo;ve never read her <i>Wuthering Heights</i> and do
not intend to. (More about why later.) Basically, it would be like
watching Marian Anderson sing a bawdy sailor&rsquo;s song. However, her
poetry I read continually, discovering new things, gleaning deeper
insights each time. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB">here</a> for a quick biography.  <br>

Here EB is direct, blunt even. But now we know. Either she speaks to
something in you, or you are part of the majority who finds
it&#x2014;weird, abnormal, morbid, overwrought, puerile, even sick or
evil. To be sure, my dark <i>penchant</i> gets mostly deer-in-headlights

druthers as morose, morbid, as wallowing in self-pity, seeking
attention, dwelling on the negative&#x2014;and then the quick DSM–5

Rossetti exposits a dark fatalism, ending with hope bound in humble
expectancy. I like to think these two English poetesses are expressing
an informed, matured melancholy that bespeaks a deeper understanding
of life&#x2014;all because of their grasp of Dark.

Yes, poems, as the Dark Muse seems to find its best, most
concentrated expression through poetry. Much more on why mainly poetry
delivers the ineffable of darkness later.

rather, a popular, &ldquo;uplifting&rdquo; poet with a big audience. That&rsquo;s what
makes this selection so unique for me.
</span> looking to the natural world and
<i>poetising</i>, to be sure, <i>darkly</i>. The idea of poetising, the
<i>poetisation</i> of nature and life was central to the Romantic
Movement.<label id='fnr.22' for='fnr-in.22.2535754' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.22.2535754' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup>
Below we will go over Romanticism poetising&rsquo;s originator,
Novalis.
</span> It parallels the long-standing belief that we humans
explain ourselves through, embed our lives in narratives. And so
agents, triggers of mental affliction and depression&#x2014;despair, grief,
misery&#x2014;are transformed into more equanimous states of sadness and
melancholy, hopefully bringing us to a higher emotional
maturity.<label id='fnr.23' for='fnr-in.23.1650310' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.23.1650310' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup>
Events in life, especially hardships, are supposed to
<i>increase</i> our emotional depth and maturity, not become excuses for
anti-social behaviour and emotional immaturity as we so often see
today.
</span> In some paradoxical way, nature and darkness
eventually become healers &#x2026; as if the initial agony and sorrow are a
ravaging cancer or virus that may eventually fade into remission, but
we can never entirely conquer, eliminate whilst on Earth, hence, a
strange symbiosis must be struck&#x2026; As I will endeavour to explain,
being <i>mortal</i> was wholly different experience back then.
</p>

<p>
This <i>poetising</i> of Nature dark and mystical was the modus operandi of
my select nineteenth-century poets. Rather than avoid, they sought
out, <i>embraced</i> their Dark Muse, something we today in our
brightly-lit, cordoned-off world usually think of as wrong-headed. I
contend we have lost this subtle art of moving hardship, tragedy,
emotional crises into a stasis remission melancholy. Today, we wage a
full-scale war against melancholia psycho-analyses and prescription
psycho-pharma drugs. And so too often we are failures at finding a
<i>modus vivendi</i><label id='fnr.24' for='fnr-in.24.1165058' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.24.1165058' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup>
<i>modus vivendi</i>: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, <i>or</i> (literally) a way of living.
</span> vis-à-vis the trials and tribulations of life
as our ancestors once did.

</span> of mid-1800s Amherst,
Massachusetts, relates, the human must suffer in a severe if not grand
way. Again, all we may ever do is disperse the initially searing,
inescapable pain to a dull, hopefully diluted ache in the ever-growing
backdrop of time. Though again I would say this was better conducted
in the past than today. How, why? Because they did not attempt to
contain, disguise, systematise, or <i>process</i> greif; rather, greif was
faced directly, <i>pain was shared</i>, empathy a way of communal life. And
so emotional space was allotted, support was shared, organic, and
natural. Strikingly different from today was their acceptance of
<i>doom</i><label id='fnr.26' for='fnr-in.26.5913226' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.26.5913226' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>26</sup>
Doom as unforeseen consequences of previous actions, which in
turn, entropically snowball into indebtedness, tragedy, and ruin;
typically multi-generational, a punishment that never seems to fit the
original crime&#x2014;if it was a crime at all. One German word for doom is
<i>Untergang</i>, which also means <i>downfall</i>.

in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg who upon losing her husband
Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. In those days death was properly, officially mourned. No one
chivvied mourners along with their grief and sadness. Contrast this
with today&rsquo;s all-too-prevalent disassociation, the confused emotional
shutdown, the disorganised quasi-denial and suppression we moderns too

Is there anything worse than the so-called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief">five stages of

to be systematically reduced, fixed, corrected? Alas.
</span>. For the early nineteenth century,
poetising life&rsquo;s train of tragedy was <i>depression deconstruction</i> as a
life skill. The slings and arrows of human existence found conjunction
with <i>Nature</i>, <i>Dark</i>, and <i>Faith</i> through poetry, thereby
highlighting, elevating our uniquely human experience on Earth,
<b>casting a gossamer of sublimity over our natural existence like no
other generation before or since</b>. Theirs was the deepest exploration
of our true humanness that I know, and, thus, something I must pursue
and showcase here.

But still, why Dark? Dark speaks to me. But again, how, why? Lack of a
clear and simple answer forces me into a regrettably wordier one?
Dark remains mysterious&#x2014;no matter how many different angles from
which I try to imbibe and then express it. Dark is something
instinctual, cathartic, evocative, centring for me. Dark is more than
the lack of light. Dark can lead the imagination to riot. The moss,
lichens, and mushrooms in the secretive shadows of the forest incite
so much more than the spectacular sunny vista across the forest
valley. Let&rsquo;s give spectacular a rest.

<p>
The new cut rose: Initially beautiful, thereafter dried and
desiccated, lost forever its initial delicate beauty and
fragrance. Once affording a glimpse of perfection, only reminiscent
thereafter. Beauty always some fleeting illusion or madness? Moreover
its eclipse, joining, leading the shadows of our relentless doom, our
march to the grave. And though I live in this momentary brilliance, I
still search my night shore; for until now I have known only of
beauty’s haunting rumour, of love’s promise, those slightest
quickenings of things necessarily rare and formerly peripheral. Yes,
in this moment I may have some of love’s bliss, of roses&rsquo; beauty, but
I know I shall cherish with a larger, more mature heart the memories
thereof, echoes sent down life’s long, clouded memory hall as true and
lasting blessings.

My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson is based on
their earthly abodes&#x2014;Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.
</span> Alone the fact that our typical indoor living
environments today are more like modular, sealed <i>space stations</i>
plopped down on a hostile alien planet compared to the simpler, more
primitive structures of the not-so-distant past&#x2026; Quite literally, the
Brontës&rsquo; Haworth parsonage, built in 1778 out of local stone and wood
and clay, had more in common with human shelters from one, <i>two</i>
thousand years previous than with our modern suburban homes only some
two hundred years later.

<p>
Even as late as my own childhood the term <i>homespun</i> was in use to
indicate a poor, unsophisticated person, a country bumkin, a hick from
the sticks. The term referred to a person&rsquo;s clothing being homemade
from locally-sourced, hand-spun and woven materials such as linen and
wool rather than factory-made retail clothing. The early-nineteenth
century Brontëan West Yorkshire would have seen the majority of the
villagers in homespun, all but a few garments not hand-tailored
bespoke.<label id='fnr.34' for='fnr-in.34.8006679' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.34.8006679' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup>
However cotton was rapidly becoming a global commodity, both
cotton and wool fabrics eventually being produced in steam-powered
factories as the Industrial Age reached its inflexion point of growth.
</span> And of course food was entirely from local
production. Hence, a person&rsquo;s daily resources were overwhelmingly
local, a small bit perhaps coming from a nearby <i>market town</i>, while
only the most exotic items (e.g., a clock, a fine musical instrument)
would have come from farther away. Today, however, this supply pyramid
is completely flipped, as nearly everything comes from far (far!) away
(e.g. China), while only a few personal items would be from a local or
even regional source.<label id='fnr.35' for='fnr-in.35.2219476' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.35.2219476' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup>
In any modern (non-organic Amazon Whole Foods-style)
supermarket I&rsquo;m sure less that 1% of the food items come from a truly
local source. Nearly everything is shipped in from often far afar.
</span> And so in Brontëan times (first half of
the 1800s) the surrounding land was agriculturally domesticated, a
working partner. Contrast this with today&rsquo;s urban-suburban populations
hardly ever in contact with farmers or their farms. Nor do we know
anything about where our clothing came from. Today, nature as &ldquo;the
land,&rdquo; as our immediate provider, has been completely abstracted into
concepts such as <i>ecosystems</i>, which implies we are now removed
observers controlling nature as if it were just another of our
mechanical objects.
</p>

No doubt we have always made a distinction between being <i>inside</i> a
shelter and going <i>outside</i> into the so-called <i>elements</i>. But
starting some six to ten thousand years ago we began to give up
aboriginal nomadic life and its direct daily contact with said
untamed, uncontrolled elements in order to establish permanent
city-states supported by mass monoculture agriculture. And so indoor
environments in ever-expanding urban centres became increasingly
physically removed, walled off from the wild natural world, becoming
evermore self-contained, all-encompassing, self-referencing, thus,
<i>recursively derivative</i>.<label id='fnr.36' for='fnr-in.36.3691904' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.36.3691904' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., what is a flower garden but a derivative, a mock-up
of an original place out in the wilds, albeit with the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits left, weeded out?
</span>
</p>

<p>
Along with this growing separation came mentalities, narratives
increasingly based indoors and <i>extra-natural</i>.<label id='fnr.37' for='fnr-in.37.4693493' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.37.4693493' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup>
How often is a Shakespeare character out communing with
nature? Never?&#x2026;
</span> Being indoors
meant we no longer were in direct contact with the nature spirits all
around; instead, praying to an extra-natural, off-world monotheistic
God in architectural showcase churches.<label id='fnr.38' for='fnr-in.38.7288065' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.38.7288065' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup>
Churches were typically built in the centre of a town or city
on the highest ground. I once heard that to this day no building in
Vienna may be built taller than the tower of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Cathedral.
</span> Western architecture
seemed to reach a fantastical aesthetic crescendo in the Victorian
nineteenth century<label id='fnr.39' for='fnr-in.39.6487660' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.39.6487660' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup>
&#x2026;with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as a leading
style. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were
&ldquo;revivalist-nostalgic&rdquo; (Greek, Gothic, Italianate, Elizabethan, Queen
Anne, etc.), perhaps a hearkening back to times more integrated with
nature, with shallower gradients between indoors and outdoors?
</span>, coinciding with an exponential growth in
urban population which had just passed an inflection point. Today the
steepness of our indoor-outdoor gradient has increased even more since
Victorian times &#x2026; resulting in a humanity more abstracted
<i>extra-natural</i> than ever. How then may we, a species seemingly
capable of great adaptability, objectively measure our
separation from nature?
</p>

<p>
But then what is this human adaptability? I posit there are two sorts
of adaptability leading to,
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>a permanent (beneficial) alteration, or</li>
<li>a temporary adjustment, an allowance for less-that-optimal
conditions, supposing an eventual return to optimal conditions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We humans, I contend, are the second type of adaptable. This means we
are certainly no barometer species or &ldquo;canary in the coal mine&rdquo; of our
own well-being. We routinely ignore our fellow canary-like humans,
allowing them to suffer and die, their warnings unheeded. What has
domestic, urban, indoor living done to our brains, our sense of
belonging to the planet, to one another?  How can we even begin to
trace back the many rabbit hole bifurcations, the chain of derivatives
we&rsquo;ve taken for all these centuries down and out and away from <i>nature
pure</i>?  To be sure, we have demonstrated a collective will to make
conditions better for us <i>and us alone</i>. We mainly see our dominion
over, abstraction away, separation from nature as fate, as
destiny. After all, our population doubling in less than fifty years
to eight billion<label id='fnr.40' for='fnr-in.40.4666375' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>40</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.40.4666375' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>40</sup>
Human population grew 60% between 1800 and 1900, and <i>260%</i>
between 1900 and 2000.
</span> says something to our intention and ability to
dominate. And we seem to have adapted our collective human psyche, our
narratives to this separation.<label id='fnr.41' for='fnr-in.41.600043' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>41</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.41.600043' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>41</sup>
Modern human narratives come at us as thousands upon thousands
of fictional novels, films, plays, while aboriginal peoples had myth
and legends timeless and unchanging. That alone&#x2026;
</span> <i>But is this sustainable?</i> All
doomsday spinnings aside, many of us today have grown concerned over
the question of sustainability, concerned about our long arc of
estrangement from nature.<label id='fnr.42' for='fnr-in.42.2765996' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>42</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.42.2765996' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>42</sup>
Is our relatively gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling frog</a> metaphor?
</span> Let me suggest a completely different
understanding of nature, namely&#x2014;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Nature is not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature is everything going on everywhere. Nature is the myriad cycles
of <b>birth</b>, <b>growth</b>, <b>deterioration</b>, and <b>death</b> happening
everywhere all the time.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, knew,
sensed this pre-modern meaning of nature as beyond inside or
outside. Yes, one went outside, out into the elements. But once back
indoors, a Brontë sister was not so completely out of and above
nature&rsquo;s touch, influence, <i>doom</i> as we now fancy ourselves. Again,
the cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and especially death were
happening everywhere <i>sans emplacement</i>. Consider how the Industrial
Revolution created urban production landscapes vast and barren and so
completely devoid of any sort of nature, spatial or
otherwise&#x2014;indeed, William Blake&rsquo;s &ldquo;satanic mills.&rdquo; Here is what
Ludwig Klages in the late-1800s said
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The face of the mainland has become a landscape of coerced
&ldquo;Chicago-ifications&rdquo; as humanity has fallen into an orgy of destruction
without precedence. So-called civilization wears the face of an
unleashed murderer, while the fullness, the bounty of the earth has
withered from his poisonous breath.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This was a change on a scale never before seen, a huge and relatively
sudden step away from the physical world being solely the purveyance
of nature. And so even when the individual left his house he was still
deep within a massive concentration of extra-natural, human-exclusive
space and activity. Poverty in the pre-industrial rural landscape was
all but idyllic compared the grueling, grinding poverty of the
industrial cityscapes.<label id='fnr.43' for='fnr-in.43.1803119' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>43</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.43.1803119' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>43</sup>
What became of Wordsworth&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45560/to-a-highland-girl">To a Highland Girl</a></i> shepherdess
when she and her family were forced into an industrial urban slum? We
can only hope she and her kin are in a better place now&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<p>
Here is an excerpt from Emily Brontë from her poem <i>Shall earth no more inspire thee</i>
where Mother Nature speaks directly to the wayward human
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;<br>
Thy mind is ever moving<br>
In regions dark to thee;<br>
Recall its useless roving—<br>
Come back and dwell with me.<br>
&#x2026;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I can&rsquo;t read this poem without having a very emotional
response. Indeed, the house of mirrors echo chamber that modern life
has become precludes any real adaptation. And so the choice is simple:
We can go back to nature <i>or</i> continue our useless roving, which can
only lead to evermore alienation&#x2014;from real Nature, as well as from
each other.
</p>

<p>
To be sure, so much ominous and doomsday has been said about mass
society in this modern industrialised world—all pointing to the
increasingly obvious fact that our vaunted adaptation skills are being
stretched to the breaking point, dysphoria increasing, ecological
collapse inevitable.
</p>

<p>
And again Emily Brontë, her epic <i>The night is darkening round me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The night is darkening round me,<br>
The wild winds coldly blow;<br>
But a tyrant spell has bound me,<br>
And I cannot, cannot go.<br>
<br>
The giant trees are bending<br>
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;<br>
The storm is fast descending,<br>
And yet I cannot go.<br>
<br>
Clouds beyond clouds above me,<br>
Wastes beyond wastes below;<br>
But nothing drear can move me;<br>
I will not, cannot go.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Yes, she is outdoors &ldquo;facing the elements,&rdquo; as we say. She even refers
to the wilds as &ldquo;wastes&rdquo; and as &ldquo;drear.&rdquo;<label id='fnr.44' for='fnr-in.44.5679331' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>44</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.44.5679331' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>44</sup>
In those days wild, untouched places were often referred to as
wastelands.
</span> And yet she is
transfixed, frozen to the spot&#x2014;and I cannot, cannot go, as she
says. Subjective terms like wastes and drear refer to the age-old
attitudes towards nature as a terrible, grim, inescapable master, a
sponsor of disaster and death, hardly over which to linger, let alone
wax poetic. But Romantic Era poets did just that, and to be sure,
grandeur and sublimity expressed in lines of verse was the surprising
result. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared directly at
an enemy previously known as all-powerful and unforgiving, and in so
doing she sensed something deep and personally transformative. She was
stirred to write lines that, for me at least, are the very centre of
the mystery of Life, Death, and the Dark Muse.
</p>

<p>
Now, contrast Brontëan Nature with Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s
twentieth-century nature. Hemingway and his contemporaries rambled
hither and yon, all over the globe trying to find the ultimate nature
experience. He shut down his emotions and senses and forced his will
upon nature, dominating these exotic locations to prove his worthiness
as a man.
</p>

<p>
But of course it was all just macho-man theatre. If anything serious
had happened to him he could have been airlifted out to receive modern
medical care. Not the Romantic Era poets, however, who were in harm&rsquo;s
way with no timeouts, no escape. Would Hemingway have done all those
macho-man things if there had been no modern world with modern medical
aid just a plane ride away? Haworth Emily lived in a time when
<i>nothing</i> was modern, i.e., her West Yorkshire moorlands were
semi-wilderness, and early eighteenth-century medicine didn&rsquo;t even
know about germs.<label id='fnr.45' for='fnr-in.45.4390980' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>45</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.45.4390980' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>45</sup>
What is generally acknowledged as a clear breakthrough was
John Snow&rsquo;s tracing of the London cholera outbreak of 1854 back to
certain London neighborhood publich wells. This was strong proof of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease">contagion theory</a>. However, it wasn&rsquo;t until the late nineteenth
century that Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur established the field of
bacteriology and our modern scientific understanding of microscopic
pathogens finally developed.
</span> Literally, a cut on a toe could become
infected resulting in death in those times. Thus, nature for a Brontë
sister was not a contest, nor a show, nor a game.
</p>

<p>
With nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around, the last two components, deterioration and
death, must be understood beyond our mechanistic reductionist modern
take of just physical malfunction.<label id='fnr.46' for='fnr-in.46.8478366' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>46</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.46.8478366' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>46</sup>
Couple this mechanistic &ldquo;death as malfunction&rdquo; with atheist
nihilism to arrive at today&rsquo;s soulless mechanical universe realism
dumpster fire.
</span> Back in the day, death was a
<i>force majeure</i>, but no longer thanks to modern medicine. It&rsquo;s almost
as if deterioration and death, two of nature&rsquo;s supposedly inescapable
realities, have been cordoned off&#x2014;or at least placed under much
greater human control than ever before. <i>It&rsquo;s as if through modern
medicine we have begun to acquire a demi-godlike, proto-immortal veto
power over physical demise.</i> And with this control we have torn down,
dismantled a great component of spirituality, namely the reckoning of
one&rsquo;s mortality with a deity. Where once was supposed a <i>mortal</i>,
physical plane inferior an <i>immortal</i> spiritual plane, we now would
believe only the physical plane to be relevant. And with this comes a
great psychic and spiritual impoverishment, the extent of which we
cannot fully know.
</p>

<p>
Though for the meantime death remains an undeniable certainty. Death
comes as it always has&#x2014;from old age, fatal accident, or deadly
physical aggression or predation.<label id='fnr.47' for='fnr-in.47.7457167' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>47</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.47.7457167' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>47</sup>
For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are&#x2014;outside of war and homicidal aggression&#x2014;all
but exclusively bacteria and viruses.
</span> But a completely different
attitude arises when modern healthcare&rsquo;s labyrinth of diagnoses,
drugs, procedures and surgeries routinely thwart what was once all but
certain, as well as swift demise. And so we&rsquo;ve begun to lessen the
mystery of Death, overturn fate, consequence, and doom.
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.<br>
&#x2014; Psalm 90:10<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is surely the old-fashioned take on death and its finalistic,
absolute inevitability so resounding as to constantly shake and echo
through life. Death as life&rsquo;s backstop, container, timer, combinator,
reaper.<label id='fnr.48' for='fnr-in.48.8147625' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>48</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.48.8147625' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>48</sup>
Consider <a href="https://youtu.be/SMNGhPgCKzw?si=L4HFHQuUTnP3j8I6">this quite tolerable goth version</a> of the classic rock
song. Had this been written in Brontëan times, it would have been no
cheap, sentimental gimmick.
</span> And so I say, as death is interrupted, so are the
greater human cycles of emotion and spirituality interrupted.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, what if we start to take command of Death&rsquo;s appointment book,
rerouting, rescheduling Death&rsquo;s comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is
making the point that by no means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty
years of life, and even if we get them they might not be that
great. And yet we have grown to <i>expect</i> from the implicit promises of
modern medical science a healthy, high-quality seventy, eighty,
ninety, or even more years. Again, modern medicine has disrupted the
two last components of a nature ubiquitous cyclic, i.e., deterioration
and death, thereby further collapsing our understanding of what true
nature is. Modern science has lessened the wallop of tragedy, weakened
overall the doominess of doom by redefining life as just so much
carbon-based machine circuitry, a mechanism that, in turn, is to be
better and better repaired, maintained, improved against entropic
wear-and-tear.<label id='fnr.49' for='fnr-in.49.4122366' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.49.4122366' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup>
Consider the now commonplace heart pacemaker, a device that
literally overrides the human heart with artificial electronic
pulses. Also, hip and knee replacements are now routine.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Allow me to relate a modern story about our new attitude towards
death. My father, who has since passed away, lost his <i>third</i> wife to
lung cancer caused inevitably by decades of her smoking.<label id='fnr.50' for='fnr-in.50.6213328' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>50</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.50.6213328' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>50</sup>
Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.
</span> But
instead of accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst? I eventually theorised that
from all the buzz surrounding the various possible medical
interventions&#x2014;including their probabilities of success or
failure&#x2014;he began to expect the death sentence of lung cancer could,
<i>should</i> be beaten by some technology lurking in some corner of the
modern medical labyrinth. Death was not the long-anticipated reunion
with the Creator, rather, enmity and recriminations over the failure
of procedures and medications. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed Death&rsquo;s arrival to
such an absurd degree. Human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of Death able to lap over at any time. But today
the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has become an all but
guaranteed minimum. Old age and death are increasingly spoken of as
&ldquo;diseases&rdquo; we can and should defeat. Death as a nuisance, indeed. My
father felt cheated when that three-, fourscore and more was not
forthcoming for his wife. But as you may anticipate, I contend life is
truly life only with Death&#x2014;Death absolute and not easily pushed
back, much less obviated.

<i>Poesie</i> <label id='fnr.58' for='fnr-in.58.8368647' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>58</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.58.8368647' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>58</sup>
The German <i>Poesie</i> is typically translated as simply
<i>poetry</i>; however, poetry as a concept beyond just the literary art,
more towards the older <i>poesy</i> perhaps. And of course Novalis and the
Jena Set expanded even further&#x2026;
</span> as an all-embracing paradigm to counter the cold,
dehumanising, thus <i>desensitising</i> implications of Enlightenment Age
rationalism and determinism, as well as the stultifying formalisms of
Classicism. <b>Novalis sounded the charge to <i>re-sensitise</i> the human
being</b>. Lots more on this later&#x2026;

Alas, but here is where I become quite the iconoclast, primarily by
insisting <i>academe has Romanticism wrong!</i> <label id='fnr.59' for='fnr-in.59.5900263' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>59</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.59.5900263' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>59</sup>
Again, I will go into how Romanticism is an ivory tower fata
morgana in detail soon.
</span> Even Novalis&rsquo;
supporters, his Jena contemporaries, yes, even Novalis himself seemed
to lose the thread and march about spouting dessicated
intellectualisations.<label id='fnr.60' for='fnr-in.60.6659724' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>60</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.60.6659724' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>60</sup>
If you must, read <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/novalis/">this about Novalis</a>, which is as good as
any. But as academe is wont to do, it hangs on every word uttered and
written by a young man feeling his way along in his twenties. This
approach may work with Bohr and Einstein, but not a twenty-something
poet&#x2026;
</span> I posit that Novalis with his
foundational <i>HttN</i> took off like a sleepwalker towards the Dark
Muse. However, Romanticism, as subsequently cooked up by &ldquo;experts&rdquo;
during and after, became a bloated, overanalysed, theory-bound,
cart-before-the-horse disaster. Or I will simply say German
Romanticism began true but veered off into the ditch&#x2014;all while
Wordsworthian English Romanticism never really emphasised Dark to any
great extent, except for Coleridge&rsquo;s gothic borrowings from the
eighteenth century.<label id='fnr.61' for='fnr-in.61.4298291' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>61</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.61.4298291' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>61</sup>

</p>

<p>
I contend Romanticism was a spiritual and cultural <i>force majeure</i>,
like a huge river breaking into multiple braided channels across a
broad landscape with little to say about it other than it was wet. And
so my whole point with WutheriingUK is to urge you to simply <b>read,
sigh, reflect&#x2014;repeat</b> and not follow any of the scholarly
technocrats down their musty rabbit holes where the spirit of it all
suffocates. Of course this may seem naive context-free amateurish of
me, but the alternative is winding up lost and clueless as I believe
the vast majority of Romanticism scholars are. Academe Romanticism is
truly the blind leading the blind. But let&rsquo;s get to <i>HttN</i>&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Reading <i>HttN</i> one cannot escape the sheer intensity of Novalis&rsquo;
swoon-fest over Night and Death. Here is a small taste
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I feel the flow of<br>
Death&rsquo;s youth-giving flood;<br>
To balsam and æther, it<br>
Changes my blood!<br>
I live all the daytime<br>
In faith and in might:<br>
And in holy rapture<br>
I die every night.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
and just before came
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
What delight, what pleasure offers <i>thy</i> life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night? Thy mother, it is she brings thee forth, and to her thou owest all thy glory.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
It my opinion <i>HttN</i> is one of the densest, purest, most direct
attesting to the Dark Muse ever.<label id='fnr.62' for='fnr-in.62.1722809' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>62</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.62.1722809' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>62</sup>
But <i>HttN</i> wasn&rsquo;t entirely new after all. Soon will be
discussed similar offerings from the previous eighteenth century.
</span> As the legend tells, his
inspiration came from being grief-stricken at the death of his
fifteen-year-old fiancée Sophie von Kühn,<label id='fnr.63' for='fnr-in.63.6341975' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>63</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.63.6341975' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>63</sup>
Sophie von Kühn <br>
<img src="images/Sophie_von_Kühn.jpg" alt="Sophie_von_Kühn.jpg"> <br>
<br>
</span> to whose grave he
made a pilgrimage for one hundred nights. The Jena Set writer Ludwig
Tieck described the teenage Sophie
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Even as a child, she gave an impression which&#x2014;because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely&#x2014;we must call super-earthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, Sophie was a shining paragon of what I might call <i>apex human
sensitisation</i> while on earth.<label id='fnr.64' for='fnr-in.64.768281' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>64</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.64.768281' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>64</sup>
We&rsquo;ll dive into Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s very similar idealisations
in his possibly most popular poem <i>Annabel Lee</i> soon.
</span> And it was her death that threw
Novalis into despair so deep that he then fell into his trance-like,
visionary state. <i>HttN</i> was most certainly not just the gymnastics of
flipping the sacred to profane and profane to sacred as Novalis
himself described romanticising poetising. He journeyed into Night and
came back with some of the most compelling Dark ever. But then yawned
open this great abyss between producers and
describer-promoters&#x2026;<label id='fnr.65' for='fnr-in.65.3259718' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>65</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.65.3259718' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>65</sup>
Yes, give Wulf&rsquo;s <i>Magnificent Rebels</i> a shot. But you&rsquo;ll
quickly realise she is more like a gossip columnist going on about
celebrities than someone who understands what they were actually
about. For all intents and purposes, she might as well have been
describing Andy Warhol&rsquo;s <i>Factory</i>, a place where society buzz was
more important than the actual art supposedly produced.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8258019">
<p>
Samuel Taylor Coleridge is generally accepted as the leading
intellectualiser of British Romanticism during its inception roughly
parallel to the Jena Romantic liftoff. Following is a Coleridge quote
as good as any
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each
other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the
accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as
the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible
directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces
should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike
indestructible&#x2026; this one power with its two inherent indestructible
yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which
their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and
the process of our own self-consciousness.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, such wordy intellectualisations are the usual fodder seized
upon by latter-day academes whipping up copy. Yes, Coleridge and
Wordsworth&rsquo;s <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> is considered the cornerstone of
English Romanticism with its extensive poetising of Nature. And yet
these men do not seem to know the Dark Muse.
</p>

<p>
Now, let us consider what English poet John Keats said years
later in a 1817 letter to his brothers George and Thomas
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;I mean <b>Negative Capability</b>, that is, when a man is capable of
being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
reaching after fact and reason&#x2014;Coleridge, for instance, would let go
by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of
mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with
half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no
further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty
overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all
consideration.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Keats repudiates hard and fast ideas, neatly, logically circumscribed,
battling it out for supremacy. Intellectualisations, great and
lengthy, especially of the &ldquo;Penetralium<label id='fnr.66' for='fnr-in.66.4300700' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>66</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.66.4300700' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>66</sup>
<b>penetralium</b>: (plural <i>penetralia</i>) the innermost (or most
secret) part of a building; an inner sanctum; a sanctum sanctorum.

so much verisimilar<label id='fnr.67' for='fnr-in.67.7314257' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>67</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.67.7314257' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>67</sup>
<b>verisimilar</b>: having the appearance of truth.
</span> ramblings to him. Indeed, to <i>not</i>
immediately intellectualise, but to hold oneself in that maddeningly
counter-intuitive state of unresolved&#x2014;just to see where it might
lead&#x2014;is Keats&rsquo; great insight. Feelings and impressions and what-ifs
must be gently, carefully raised up out of the mental ruckus. To be
sure, <i>Negative Capability</i> is about <i>cognitive dissonance</i> as a great
and necessary burden the poet must carry, a mental control technique
key towards deeper insights and understanding. And so the poet must
fly beyond the neat and tidy piles of logical-seeming words. Keats
went on to to obviate the sterility of academic intellectualisms with
his simple ode to Beauty. Here is the famed beginning of his &ldquo;poetic
romance&rdquo; <i>Endymion</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:<br>
Its loveliness increases; it will never<br>
Pass into nothingness; but still will keep<br>
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep<br>
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.<br>
Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing<br>
A flowery band to bind us to the earth,<br>
Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth<br>
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,<br>
Of all the unhealthy and o&rsquo;er-darkened ways<br>
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,<br>
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall<br>
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,<br>
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon<br>
For simple sheep; and such are daffodils<br>
With the green world they live in; and clear rills<br>
That for themselves a cooling covert make<br>
&rsquo;Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,<br>
Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:<br>
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms<br>
We have imagined for the mighty dead;<br>
All lovely tales that we have heard or read:<br>
An endless fountain of immortal drink,<br>
Pouring unto us from the heaven&rsquo;s brink.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Take that Coleridge, you brachial babbling braincase! Again, <b>read,
sigh, reflect&#x2014;repeat.</b> Let this sink in, dear reader.
</p>

<p>
In the 2009 film <i>Bright Star</i>, a touching verisimilar bio-drama about
Keats, there is a scene where, speaking to his love interest Fanny
Brawne, he says
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A poet is not at all poetical. In fact, he the most unpoetical thing
in existence. He has no identity. He is continually filling some other
body&#x2014;the sun, the moon&#x2026; Poetic craft is a carcass, a
sham. If poetry does not come as naturally as leaves to a tree then
it had better not come at all.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And then Fanny says, <i>I still don&rsquo;t know how to work out a poem.</i> To
which Keats says<label id='fnr.68' for='fnr-in.68.47737' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>68</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.68.47737' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>68</sup>
<a href="https://youtu.be/bASfrZYnkvI?si=JKGP2LiHgOj-h9oL">Here</a> is the scene from <i>Bright Star</i>.
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving
in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the
lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not <i>work</i> the
lake out. It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and
emboldens the soul to accept mystery.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And thus, I would posit he, like I two centuries later, did not see
Romanticism as something needs bundling and explaining and stuck with
labels and herded into categories. The point of hearing birdsong is
not to think about male birds warding off other males while trying to
appeal to females, but to luxuriate in the wonderful chorus of
nature. Time and time again I listen to or read a description of
Romanticism and come away feeling the scholar, the author understood
nothing, rather, is simply stringing disparate bits and bobs together
towards some verisimilitude of a penetralia they don&rsquo;t really get or
understand. And so I say the intellectual prison in which academe has
stuck Romanticism should be opened up, the guards soundly switched and
run off, the prisoners let back out into the wide fields and deep
woods. And so I&rsquo;ll soon be thrashing the guards more thoroughly below&#x2026;

<i>The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature&rsquo;s Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work</i> by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.
</span> author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to <i>thrive</i>, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural homes such as rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, <i>but wait</i>,
haven&rsquo;t these bats jumped <i>outside</i> of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of <i>trans</i>-bat-ism. But is this good for nature as a
whole? In effect, the bats have short-circuited their doom, their
fate. Again, what are the real long-term consequences?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps bats doing better is not too much of an imbalance vis-a-vis
the rest of their competitors and surrounding environment.<label id='fnr.70' for='fnr-in.70.1262755' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>70</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.70.1262755' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>70</sup>
Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven&rsquo;t noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats&rsquo; primary food sources.
</span> And
yet what happens when a species keeps thriving more and more,
increasing its success statistics, stepping over, beyond any of the
natural restrictions that <i>total</i> integration and harmony with nature
would have required? <b>Aren&rsquo;t we humans Exhibit A of just such an
out-of-control species?</b> And so I ask, how can all this so-called
thriving be good, end well?  How can a dominant species like
ours&#x2014;which always seems to be &ldquo;gaming the system,&rdquo; evermore
ingeniously and aggressively extra-natural&#x2014;not eventually have to
pay some price? Simply put, How can more and more people consuming
more and more resources and energy, each of us fantasising about
success and prosperity, not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?
</p>

<p>
Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to its tightly integrated niche, then
exponential growth ensues&#x2014;which eventually must hit an inflexion
point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards an
inevitable overshoot and crash.
</p>

<p>
I bring all this up because, to my mind, Emily Brontë was just this
sort of hard-pressed little bat out in the wilds&#x2014;colony-less,
huddled in a hollow tree, barely eking out a marginal life. Here is
her <i>Plead for me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Why I have persevered to shun<br>
The common paths that others run;<br>
And on a strange road journeyed on<br>
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—<br>
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.<br>
<br>
These once indeed seemed Beings divine,<br>
And they perchance heard vows of mine<br>
And saw my offerings on their shrine—<br>
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,<br>
And mine were worthily despised;<br>
<br>
My Darling Pain that wounds and sears<br>
And wrings a blessing out from tears<br>
By deadening me to real cares;<br>
And yet, a king&#x2014;though prudence well<br>
Have taught thy subject to rebel.<br>
<br>
And am I wrong to worship where<br>
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,<br>
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?<br>
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me<br>
And tell why I have chosen thee!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I consider this her ode to skipping the unnatural trans-human thrive
scene of her day and striking out into some Beyond to commune with her
God of Visions. Again, I must believe she was a little bat fluttering
across the semi-wilderness moorland, as true an existential
<i>underdog</i>, a quasi-equal of all the other underdog wild critters, as
was still possible back then.
</p>

<p>
Compare this with today&rsquo;s outdoor adventurer who, clad in his
technical gear from REI, Patagonia, North Face, drives to government
set-aside wilds such as the Smokies mentioned above in a
four-wheel-drive Jeep Cherokee, consumes protein bars and electrolyte
drinks, listens to appropriate New Age music with earbuds, takes smart
phone pictures and GoPro videos. Any mishaps? Call for immediate
helicopter rescue on the iPhone satellite connection&#x2026; At some point
we&rsquo;re just amateur Earth astronauts, no?  When nature is truly in
balance, all participants are underdogs to some degree. But we modern
humans have demanded and gained al but total dominance over nature.
</p>

<p>
Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced malnutrition, contaminated
water, tuberculosis&#x2014;pick one, two, or all three&#x2014;five months
after her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the greater world outside
of her tiny Haworth village and its surrounding hills for a few
months.<label id='fnr.71' for='fnr-in.71.5307921' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>71</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.71.5307921' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>71</sup>
&#x2026;a stay in Belgium to learn French and a short-lived gig in
nearby Halifax as a governess.
</span> As I&rsquo;ve said, hers was a world containing nothing
modern as we know it, e.g., a cut on a toe could lead to an infection
requiring amputation, or even worse.
</p>

<p>
And yet one might insist her existence in the early nineteen century
was not really so very wild and rugged&#x2014;compared to a remote
wilderness in Canada, the Rockies, or the Amazon Basin. Was she still
not observing nature from civilization&rsquo;s relative place of safety,
thereby rendering her observations just as tainted, just as removed
and relative as ours today? I say no. Clearly our modern place of
safety is so much greater than hers, as we of the twenty-first century
float above cruel Nature on unprecedented levels of high technology
materialism. Consider how we consume upwards of <i>one hundred times</i>
the resources and energy per capita as did one of our European
ancestors from 1800.<label id='fnr.72' for='fnr-in.72.2709316' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>72</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.72.2709316' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>72</sup>
&#x2026;and the bigger the dance floor, the crazier the dancing.
</span> I contend hers was a unique vantage point,
neither too exposed nor removed from elemental nature.
</p>

<p>
Still, I&rsquo;m often confronted with modern scoffers who believe Romantic
Era poets only knew nature from picnics held at country estates where
dandies and their pampered ladies were attended by servants, as seen,
for example, in Hollywood film versions of Jane Austen&rsquo;s <i>Emma</i><label id='fnr.73' for='fnr-in.73.9128117' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>73</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.73.9128117' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>73</sup>
There is nothing really otherworldly Dark or Romanticist as I
know it about Jane Austen, sadly. She was seemingly devoid,
non-pursuant of Dostoyevski&rsquo;s POEH. Although she once did say,
&ldquo;Pictures of perfection, as you know, make me sick and wicked.&rdquo;
(Letter to her niece Fanny Knight, 23 March 1817.)
</span>
</p>

<img src="./images/EmmaPicnic2.png" width="770" alt="Emma picnic">
<span class="cap"><b>Emma</b> picnic in the harrowing wilds of England</span>

<p>
Again, for us moderns nature is a <i>place</i>, a <i>location</i> away from and
diametrically opposite our modern space-station-like interior
spaces. Nature picks up somewhere outdoors, where it eventually
becomes the <i>Great Outdoors</i>. Basically, the farther afield from
modern civilization we can go, the truer and more authentic nature
supposedly becomes. And so we create a <i>nature continuum</i> whereby a
trackless wilderness as far from civilization as possible is the
truest nature, while hardly nature at all would be a weedy ditch
behind a triple-paned windowed, vinyl-siding-clad, forced-air-HVAC
suburban house. Nature can only be very wild, thus, very far away from
the safety of our space-colony civilization. But let me again be
blunt: We do not get more nature simply because we have gone like
explorer astronauts way farther out from our sterile, artificial
exclusively human home base. <i>Nature is not something close or
remote</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is precisely because we have spoiled so much of our proximate
places that we elevate far-afield wilderness to a practically
quasi-off-planet status. Writers like Ernest Hemingway and Jack London
exploit fright memes in describing distant, exotic, hostile places
like the Yukon and Africa &#x2026; again, virtually identical to science
fiction stories of strange, hostile, dangerous, alien planets
conquered by brave, intrepid astronauts.
</p>

<p>
And so I insist my poets of the so-called Romantic Era were not
pampered dandies with their fine ladies strolling for a few bored
minutes on manicured estate grounds. Nor were they &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo;
beneficiaries of the &ldquo;Age of Exploration&rdquo; colonialism. My poets were
mainly short-lived little bats in their crevasses and corners, as
hard-pressed as any bats have ever been.

</span> Bursting with a grandiosity only poetry can
reach, Young relentlessly spins out darkness and doom. To be sure, he
is Dark with a shudder, full of fright memes meant to weigh down and
ultimately defeat&#x2014;if taken seriously. A quick taste
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
"When the cock crew, he wept”&#x2014;smote by that eye<br>
Which looks on me, on all: that Power, who bids<br>
This midnight sentinel, with clarion shrill<br>
(Emblem of that which shall awake the dead),<br>
Rouse souls from slumber, into thoughts of heaven.<br>
Shall I too weep? Where then is fortitude?<br>
And, fortitude abandon’d, where is man?<br>
I know the terms on which he sees the light;<br>
He that is born, is listed; life is war;<br>
Eternal war with woe. Who bears it best,<br>
Deserves it least&#x2026;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
&#x2026;indeed, unrelenting doom and woe. Typical of Graveyard School,
there is no hope, no escape, just the weight of an assumed curse
(ultimately original sin?), then processions of lamentation to cliff
edges and fated tumbling thereoff
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Art, brainless Art! our furious charioteer&#x2026;<br>
&#x2026;Drives headlong towards the precipice of death;<br>
Death, most our dread; death thus more dreadful made:<br>
Oh, what a riddle of absurdity!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
or
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
From short (as usual) and disturb’d repose,<br>
I wake: how happy they, who wake no more!<br>
Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave.<br>
I wake, emerging from a sea of dreams<br>
Tumultuous; where my wreck’d desponding thought<br>
From wave to wave of fancied misery<br>
At random drove&#x2026;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Of course every student of the Dark Muse should read Young&rsquo;s
<i>Night-thoughts</i>. And yet this over-the-top doom hyperbole will
eventually deliver even the most indulgent reader to incredulity. Dare
I say at some point it becomes farce.<label id='fnr.75' for='fnr-in.75.9319795' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>75</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.75.9319795' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>75</sup>
YMMV. Personally, I like a good doom-and-gloom session, and
Young really delivers with <i>Night Thoughts</i>. Later we&rsquo;ll go into Emily
Brontë&rsquo;s take on doom-and-gloom and her more measured Christian
perspective.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Though Graveyard had a more contemplative, measured side. For example,
Thomas Gray&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44299/elegy-written-in-a-country-churchyard">Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard</a></i> (1751). To be
sure, eulogising the dead is a much older and well established genre,
typically emphasising the qualities of the deceased over the dark,
eternal abyss his grave might represent. If we are not meant to
survive Young&rsquo;s pounding, Gray&rsquo;s elegy of a lost friend is Dark and
fatalist and yet reverent and faithful
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,<br>
Heav&rsquo;n did a recompense as largely send:<br>
He gave to Mis&rsquo;ry all he had, a tear,<br>
He gain&rsquo;d from Heav&rsquo;n (&rsquo;twas all he wish&rsquo;d) a friend.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
With Gray whatever woefulness, doom may be swirling about, God in his
heavenly domain still has our backs. Gray doesn&rsquo;t try to beat us down
as much as did the hardcore Graveyard Schoolers.
</p>

<p>
Whence this proto-Dark? Was it simply in the air? As I insist about
the Dark Muse in general, Graveyard arrived unexpectedly, a natural,
organic upwelling&#x2014;however heavy and oppressive its expression. Which
begs the question, What rises to cultural and intellectual prominence
in an age?<label id='fnr.76' for='fnr-in.76.2146037' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>76</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.76.2146037' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>76</sup>
&#x2026;that is, in a past age not exposed to the science of modern
public relations. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">this</a> about Edward Bernays and the birth of
modern advertising and public relations. TL;DR: Since Bernays, no
&ldquo;movement&rdquo; in our modern times can be considered natural and organic,
rather, the result of somebody&rsquo;s financed public relations campaign.
</span> To be sure, many of that era condemned gothic and
Graveyard as unworthy subculture. But eventually came a refinement,
which I might call the <i>Night School</i>. Though intervening was the
<i>gothic novel</i>, which we will now investigate.<label id='fnr.77' for='fnr-in.77.8661255' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>77</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.77.8661255' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>77</sup>
&#x2026;but the Germans were not idle during this time, either. I
should also mention Gottfried August Bürger&rsquo;s very popular and often
translated into English epic poem <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenore_(ballad)">Lenore</a></i> from 1774.

Prose versus poetry. In the past poetry was seen by members of polite
society as the higher, the acceptable form of literature. For example,
Germany has long been referred to as the land of <i>poets</i> and
<i>thinkers</i>.<label id='fnr.78' for='fnr-in.78.3522630' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>78</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.78.3522630' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>78</sup>

Two terms, <i>novel</i> (English) and <i>roman</i> (French, German,
etc. from the adjectival <i>Roman</i>, <i>Roman-like</i>) came to describe any
long-form prose story-telling.
</span> on the other
hand, was not acceptable, seen as too revealing invasive personal,
i.e., it is improper, unseemly, distasteful to expose even an
imaginary person&rsquo;s life details in such an open and revealing
fashion. Thus, according to this attitude, it was a crude thing to so
freely fantasise human goings-on in a fictitious way. Rather,
literature must ennoble the human as a being created in the likeness
of God, and not dwell on his mundanity and failings. After all, a
novel was neither factual (e.g. a saint&rsquo;s hagiography) nor high
lyrical poetic (e.g., church hymn lyrics or <i>Heldenlieder</i>). A
novel/roman was simply too plain-spoken, i.e., the unavoidable clarity
of straight descriptive writing invariably generated an undesirable
ordinariness. And so it was in this mise en scène that the prose novel
bumped along post-Medieval Age as a barely tolerated corruption of
writing, as a regrettable parallel to poetry, consumed mainly by
easily excited arriviste vulgarian middle-class women. But then as the
middle class grew in power and numbers, the novel came to the fore,
especially in the eighteenth century.<label id='fnr.80' for='fnr-in.80.1555251' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>80</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.80.1555251' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>80</sup>

Modern academe considers the novel <i>The Castle of Otranto, A Gothic
Story</i>, appearing in its first edition in 1764, to be the official
start of British <i>gothic</i> literature.<label id='fnr.81' for='fnr-in.81.2066384' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>81</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.81.2066384' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>81</sup>
One giveaway is <i>gothic</i> in the title. Perhaps read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction">this
overview</a> of Gothic fiction.
</span> Written by the excentric,
iconoclastic English nobleman Horace Walpole (1717 – 1797), <i>Otranto</i>
is a melodrama set in sixteenth-century Naples offering slumming
readers a big dose of darkness, doom, and woe. Walpole&rsquo;s penchant for
medievalism rode the long-simmering nostalgic idealisation of the
Medieval Age<label id='fnr.82' for='fnr-in.82.4047004' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>82</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.82.4047004' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>82</sup>
Walpole initially claimed <i>Otranto</i> to be a medieval
manuscript he had discovered and translated, when all along it had
been his own creation.
</span>, while the adjective <i>gothic</i> referred to medieval
Gothic architecture.<label id='fnr.83' for='fnr-in.83.984248' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>83</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.83.984248' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>83</sup>
&#x2026;although this is ironic since the actual label Gothic had
been used pejoratively in the Renaissance alluding to the destructive
barbarian Goths, i.e., Gothic architecture was crude and barbaric.
</span> Gothic &ldquo;horror&rdquo; was an instant hit, and
other writers and influencers quickly joined in creating a full-on

<p>
Above is an etching from a publication of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_of_Lammermoor">The
Bride of Lammermore</a></i> (1819). Consider the sheer visual density and
heaviness of the scene (click on the image to be taken to a larger
version). <i>Whence, wherefore</i> this heaviness, this portent?
Predominant is a natural dark&#x2014;inhospitable, threatening. The
human-built castle is primitive, isolated, and vulnerable, the riders
miniscule, exposed &#x2026; as though every single living cell&#x2014;plant,
animal, human&#x2014;is clinging to life by a thread, and any dim green and
blue hues of vegetation and sea are wholly irrelevant. The scene
evokes danger, dysphoria, as if surely something horrific just waiting
to transpire. But again how, why? Why such darkness and what was (and
still is) the appeal? Hitchcock tautologies aside, modern academe has
offered theories about the socio-political-psychological landscape of
the times, and yet these &ldquo;experts&rdquo; only sound supercilious and
patronising from their modern triumphalist perches, as if they are
searching for a disease to explain a malady, weakness to explain
indulgence. No, indeed, Dark, even when crude and heavy, predominates,
arrests, mystifies, the appeal all the stronger for its recessive,
ungraspable spherical symmetry. To be sure, this &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; of
gothic in the eighteenth century was overwrought, indulgent with its
fright memes, but undeniably popular and onto something real about the
inner human experience&#x2014;at least to the Western world of those times.
</p>

<p>
The popularity of the gothic novel continued throughout the nineteenth
and into the twentieth century primarily in the romance genre&#x2014;after
the term romance had been twisted in meaning to mean love.<label id='fnr.85' for='fnr-in.85.2682680' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>85</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.85.2682680' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>85</sup>

Novelist Ann Radcliffe (1764 - 1823) could be said to be the first to
gain respectability for gothic fiction. Upper-middle-class and
spanning the proto-Romantic late-eighteenth century and the Romantic
Era, she forged a broad readership in the risen middle class for her
moral and otherwise high-brow treatment of gothic
gloom-and-doom. Again, a certain shade of Dark was evolving and
Radcliffe was a part of it.

The three most popular novels written by the Brontë sisters---<i>Jane
Eyre</i> by Charlotte, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> by Emily, and <i>The Tenant of
Wildfell Hall</i> by Anne&#x2014;would be considered gothic, and therefore, at
least according to my logic, flawed vis-à-vis Dark. Though by the time
of their publication and subsequent fame, gothic prose had completely
shaken off its lightweight and déclassé image. Hence, class and taste
was no longer the problem, rather, expression. As I&rsquo;m saying, prose
attempting Dark cannot help but land hard and miss the subtleties and
power of poetry.<label id='fnr.87' for='fnr-in.87.9636768' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>87</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.87.9636768' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>87</sup>

As personal and original as I want Novalis&rsquo; <i>Hymns to the Night</i> to
have been, I must present Englishwoman Anna Lætitia Barbauld&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_(Barbauld)/A_Summer_Evening%27s_Meditation">A
Summer Evening&rsquo;s Meditation</a></i> as the same sort of solemn praising of
the Night, but already having appeared in 1773.
</p>

<p>
Without more investigation I have no real idea if Barbauld&rsquo;s <i>ASEM</i>,
weighing in at one hundred and twenty-four lines, started what I&rsquo;m
calling the <i>Night School</i>, but as a working theory, yes, she offered
eighteenth-century Britain a new perspective on Dark with an
accessibility and maturity not really seen in Graveyard and certainly
not gothic horror. As a sort of prompt she nods to Young&rsquo;s
<i>Night-thoughts</i> with the quote, <i>One sun by day, by night ten
thousand shine</i>, then launches directly into her summer night and its
canopy of stars
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Tis past! The sultry tyrant of the south<br>
Has spent his short-liv&rsquo;d rage; more grateful hours<br>
Move silent on; the skies no more repel<br>
The dazzled sight, but with mild maiden beams<br>
Of temper&rsquo;d light, invite the cherish&rsquo;d eye<br>
To wander o&rsquo;er their sphere; where hung aloft<br>
Dian&rsquo;s bright crescent, like a silver bow<br>
New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns<br>
Impatient for the night, and seems to push<br>
Her brother down the sky. Fair Venus shines<br>
E&rsquo;en in the eye of day; with sweetest beam<br>
Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood<br>
Of soften&rsquo;d radiance from her dewy locks.<br>
The shadows spread apace; while meeken&rsquo;d Eve<br>
Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires<br>
Thro&rsquo; the Hesperian gardens of the west,<br>
And shuts the gates of day. &rsquo;Tis now the hour<br>
When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
No woe, no doom-and-gloom; instead, a relentless parade of visceral
and natural Dark hyperconductivity. Barbauld hauls us outdoors to
partake, imbibe, behold the Night like never before. We are not
swimming in doom, rather, we are touched, moved to reflect in
reverence&#x2026;
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;But are they silent all? or is there not<br>
A tongue in every star that talks with man,<br>
And wooes him to be wife; nor wooes in vain:<br>
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,<br>
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.<br>
At this still hour the self-collected soul<br>
Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there<br>
Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;<br>
An embryo God; a spark of fire divine,<br>
Which must burn on for ages, when the sun,<br>
(Fair transitory creature of a day!)<br>
Has clos&rsquo;d his golden eye, and wrap&rsquo;d in shades<br>
Forgets his wonted journey thro&rsquo; the east.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Night over day. Night a more expansive, passive, more nuanced interim
inviting deeper, more mature human introspection. Far distant, cool
and gentle are the myriad stars of a summer&rsquo;s eve, unlike our single
oversized and often ruinous local star of day. And here is some of my
own doggerel called <i>From a Grandniece To Her Great-aunt At Her
Great-uncle’s Funeral</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
You see, dear Auntie,<br>
Day is all supposes,<br>
Night but only a few.<br>

<p>
I should say this is my kind of Dark, i.e., free of any campy fright
devices&#x2014;fun as they may be. Most assuredly every protégé of the Dark
Muse must read Barbauld&rsquo;s masterpiece. Hers is an exposition of
natural darkness, placing it far above the reproach of gothic horror
detractors. Though <i>ASEM</i> was as far as I can tell a singleton, a
unicorn whose influence seemed to lay dormant for decades.<label id='fnr.88' for='fnr-in.88.7900760' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>88</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.88.7900760' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>88</sup>
&#x2026;although Wordsworth would later mention Barbauld and
<i>ASEM</i> as inspirational.
</span> One
Barbauld biographer mentioned a trend of that time of ladies studying
astronomy. But obviously Barbauld is waxing Dark, not just idealising
celestial bodies. Perusing her other poems, yes, she often dwells on
nature, sometimes in a dusky way, but addressing Dark as she did with
<i>ASEM</i> doesn&rsquo;t come forth again, nor from others during her
times. Today she is known as an influential social commentator,
moralist, and educator, but not as proto-Romanticism. And so I must
jump ahead some <i>fifty</i> years and bring in Brontëan poetry as a
continuation of this Night School thread. Haworth Emily&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Poems_of_Emily_Bront%C3%AB/Stars">Stars</a></i> is
just one her many examples of Night School from someone who probably
had never read nor heard of Barbauld&rsquo;s <i>ASEM</i>. Exactly like Barbauld,
in <i>Stars</i> Haworth Emily lauds the night and its starry sky
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Thought followed thought, star followed star<br>
Through boundless regions, on;<br>
While one sweet influence, near and far,<br>
Thrilled through, and proved us one!<br>
<br>
Why did the morning dawn to break<br>
So great, so pure, a spell;<br>
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,<br>
Where your cool radiance fell?<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
The untrammelled night sky&rsquo;s depth and expanse over the trammels of
life during sunlight, indeed. And so the last two stanzas
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night;<br>
Oh, night and stars, return!<br>
And hide me from the hostile light<br>
That does not warm, but burn;<br>
<br>
That drains the blood of suffering men;<br>
Drinks tears, instead of dew;<br>
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,<br>
And only wake with you!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Night School redeems Dark by pulling it out of the ostentatiousness,
the gimmickry of Graveyard and gothic. Started by Barbauld, it was
independently embraced by others. Let&rsquo;s look at sister Anne Brontë&rsquo;s
<i>Night</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I love the silent hour of night,<br>
For blissful dreams may then arise,<br>
Revealing to my charmed sight<br>
What may not bless my waking eyes.<br>
<br>
And then a voice may meet my ear,<br>
That death has silenced long ago;<br>
And hope and rapture may appear<br>
Instead of solitude and woe.<br>
<br>
Cold in the grave for years has lain<br>
The form it was my bliss to see;<br>
And only dreams can bring again,<br>
The darling of my heart to me.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Simpler, more measured was Anne&rsquo;s poetry than her sister&rsquo;s. And she
includes the grave by eulogising either of her older sisters Maria or
Elizabeth, or her mother, but again, sans drama. This calmer, more
introspective Dark matured in the nineteenth century.
</p>

<p>
But let us not forget the many poems devoted to the moon. Here is Anne
Brontë&rsquo;s <i>Fluctuations</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
What though the Sun had left my sky;<br>
To save me from despair<br>
The blessed Moon arose on high,<br>
And shone serenely there.<br>
<br>
I watched her, with a tearful gaze,<br>
Rise slowly o&rsquo;er the hill,<br>
While through the dim horizon&rsquo;s haze<br>
Her light gleamed faint and chill.<br>
<br>
I thought such wan and lifeless beams<br>
Could ne&rsquo;er my heart repay<br>
For the bright sun&rsquo;s most transient gleams<br>
That cheered me through the day:<br>
<br>
But, as above that mist&rsquo;s control<br>
She rose, and brighter shone,<br>
I felt her light upon my soul;<br>
But now—that light is gone!<br>
<br>
Thick vapours snatched her from my sight,<br>
And I was darkling left,<br>
All in the cold and gloomy night,<br>
Of light and hope bereft:<br>
<br>
Until, methought, a little star<br>
Shone forth with trembling ray,<br>
To cheer me with its light afar—<br>
But that, too, passed away.<br>
<br>
Anon, an earthly meteor blazed<br>
The gloomy darkness through;<br>
I smiled, yet trembled while I gazed—<br>
But that soon vanished too!<br>
<br>
And darker, drearier fell the night<br>
Upon my spirit then;—<br>
But what is that faint struggling light?<br>
Is it the Moon again?<br>
<br>
Kind Heaven! increase that silvery gleam<br>
And bid these clouds depart,<br>
And let her soft celestial beam<br>
Restore my fainting heart!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Here we may imagine the youngest Brontë bowed if not weighed down by
her earthly afflictions, cares, deprivations; but then in this lean,
hungry, susceptible state she is caught in an emotional whirling,
carried, borne up by the natural nighttime procession of sun to moon
and stars. She speaks of her tearful gaze, her fainting heart, her
spirits, her emotional exposure. She is a vulnerable ward of nature,
but tenaciously pursuant of its subtleties. Indeed, back then it was
always subtleties, delicate qualities found in Nature by the
vulnerable if not pathetic human, an exacting counting of seemingly
modest blessings which then gained sublime ascendency.
</p>

<p>
If I wasn&rsquo;t pledged to Emily, I might say Anne has an even finer take
on Dark than her older sister. I might dare to say Anne&rsquo;s Christianity
is more conventional, whereas Emily with her obvious
thought-behind-thoughts mental state took a starker, more fatalist view of
God. Anne humble, Emily defiant perhaps; <b>nevertheless, the Dark Muse
absolutely owned by these Brontës!</b>

<p>
William Wordsworth was nearly always about Nature, as were his
foundational Romanticist ideals. In his <i>A Night Thought</i>
(published 1837) he clearly intersects with Night School
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Lo! where the Moon along the sky<br>
Sails with her happy destiny;<br>
Oft is she hid from mortal eye<br>
Or dimly seen,<br>
But when the clouds asunder fly<br>
How bright her mien!<br>
<br>
Far different we&#x2014;a froward race,<br>
Thousands though rich in Fortune&rsquo;s grace<br>
With cherished sullenness of pace<br>
Their way pursue,<br>
Ingrates who wear a smileless face<br>
The whole year through.<br>
<br>
If kindred humours e&rsquo;er would make<br>
My spirit droop for drooping&rsquo;s sake,<br>
From Fancy following in thy wake,<br>
Bright ship of heaven!<br>
A counter impulse let me take<br>
And be forgiven.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Moon and Night would simply be another aspect of didactic Nature,
though he does allude to the more mature subtlety brought by the
darkness. He is clearly Night School in his <i>To the Moon</i>, here the
second stanza
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The aspiring Mountains and the winding Streams,<br>
Empress of Night! are gladdened by thy beams;<br>
A look of thine the wilderness pervades,<br>
And penetrates the forest&rsquo;s inmost shades;<br>
Thou, chequering peaceably the minster&rsquo;s gloom,<br>
Guid&rsquo;st the pale Mourner to the lost one&rsquo;s tomb;<br>
Canst reach the Prisoner&#x2014;to his grated cell<br>
Welcome, though silent and intangible!&#x2014;<br>
And lives there one, of all that come and go<br>
On the great waters toiling to and fro,<br>
One, who has watched thee at some quiet hour<br>
Enthroned aloft in undisputed power,<br>
Or crossed by vapoury streaks and clouds that move<br>
Catching the lustre they in part reprove&#x2014;<br>
Nor sometimes felt a fitness in thy sway<br>
To call up thoughts that shun the glare of day,<br>
And make the serious happier than the gay?<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Allow me to mention another Night Schooler, namely, the Swiss poet
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Keller">Gottfried Keller</a>. Again, he is even later by some three or four
decades than the Brontës or Wordsworth. Here is his <i>Winternacht</i> or
<i>Winter Night</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Not a wingbeat went through the world;<br>
silent and brilliant lay the white snow.<br>
Not a puff of cloud hung in the starry canopy,<br>
no wave surged in the torpid lake.<br>
<br>
From the depths climbed a lake-tree,<br>
to its crown encased in ice;<br>
and upon its branches climbed the water nymph,<br>
gazing up through the green ice.<br>
<br>
There I stood upon the thin glass<br>
that separated me from the black depths;<br>
Close beneath my feet I saw<br>
her white beauty, limb for limb.<br>
<br>
With smothered sorrow she groped<br>
here and there on the hard barrier.<br>
Never will I will forget her dark expression;<br>
always, always, shall it remain in my mind!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
One of my favourites, I have always wondered what the protagonist did
with the rest of his life. Did he return to the lake trying to find
his water nymph; or did he resign himself to his mortal and mundane
life? In any event, the mystery and allure of a forest in deep winter
night is undeniable. Such magic and mystery obviously could not have
occurred in daylight. Like Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s <i>The Raven</i>, which we
will discuss below, there is a melancholy over loss.
</p>

<p>
With Night School first there is Nature dark, then human reflection
upon that natural Dark; indeed, just the deepest possible recitations
of the world in darkness bring forth the finest, keenest insights.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org70a3ad1">
<p>
If a group of people enter a restaurant together the maître d&rsquo; will
probably assume they are a party and want a single table. This is a
good analogy to what has happened to my Dark principals over the
years. I certainly have a lot to say about what has come to be known
as <i>Romanticism</i>,<label id='fnr.89' for='fnr-in.89.7120933' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>89</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.89.7120933' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>89</sup>
The Jena Set&rsquo;s Friedrich Schlegel first used <i>romantic</i> in
contrast to <i>classic</i> to describe what they were doing in Jena, but it
wasn&rsquo;t until the 1820s when the term Romanticism became widely known
and used&#x2014;evermore poorly&#x2026;
</span> as it is the catch-all term meant to make my
Dark principals sit at the same table and seem good company when they
clearly are not.
</p>

<p>
By now the reader knows I want my principals to have come by their
sublime poetry &ldquo;as naturally as leaves come to a tree,&rdquo; as the film
<i>Bright Star</i>&rsquo;s Keats said. I insist my visionaries were just that,
timeless and visionary. Yes, they might have had much in common, but I
cannot abide with reducing them to puppets dangling on strings
connected, owing to proto-this or precursor-that on academe&rsquo;s assembly
line.<label id='fnr.90' for='fnr-in.90.9020498' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>90</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.90.9020498' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>90</sup>
A quote from M.H. Abrams&rsquo; laborious <i>The Mirror and the Lamp</i>
would insist &#x2026; <i>even an aesthetic philosophy so abstract and
seemingly academic as that of Kant can be shown to have modified the
work of poets.</i> Really? I doubt the Brontë sisters read much Kant. But
then Abrams never mentions the Brontës&#x2026;
</span> Of course they were of their times, and yet outliers,
outsiders, unicorns, not for lumping together or lining up on a
labelled shelf. Worse, I also insist their actual lives give little
solid insight into their gifts. And yet we have this most <i>unnatural</i>
box, this clammy container created by contemporaries during the day,
then subsequent generations of academe to hold, control, own, to
<i>jail</i> my greats, this thing they call <i>Romanticism</i>. Again, gripping
butterflies squashes them.
</p>

<p>
Chasing down influences is bread-and-butter Romantic Era
academics. One hot mess is the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0144q90/episodes/guide">BBC&rsquo;s series on Romanticism</a><label id='fnr.91' for='fnr-in.91.2210364' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>91</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.91.2210364' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>91</sup>

Experts want Romanticism to have been a spirited anti-rationalist
(unrational, disrational, irrational?), predominantly vernal youthful
<i>revolt</i> against the soulless straitjacket, the supposedly failed
humanism of Enlightenment logic, as well as against stodgy,
urban-centric classicism &#x2026; indeed, anything coming before. Like
hallucinating AI chatbots, academe spins and tangles their cords and
wires, connecting up Descartes, Rousseau, the American and French
Revolutions, Defoe, Spinoza, Bacon, Hobbs, Shakespeare,<label id='fnr.93' for='fnr-in.93.6321494' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>93</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.93.6321494' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>93</sup>
From the outset, the Schlegels in Jena made Shakespeare a
principal proto-Romanticist, Ludwig Tieck and others of the Jena Set
feverishly translating his plays into German. For me this was a clear
sign they were on the wrong road. I will eventually have my fictional
character from my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> tell you why.
</span>
&#x2026; Buddha, Jesus, Merlin, the pope, etc., to form massive graphs of
vertices and edges spreading out over the near and distant past, the
denser, the more far-fetched the better. And yet this microscopic
literary DNA matching is mostly happening long after the fact in a
modern setting, separate, aloof, and ultimately clueless. So often my
beloved visionaries are made out to be anachronistically-tagged
proto-hippie, back-to-nature, right-brain contrarian iconoclast types
doing anti-Establishment.<label id='fnr.94' for='fnr-in.94.1907830' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>94</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.94.1907830' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>94</sup>
So convenient that Jena Romanticism came about in a for its
time conspicuously free-wheeling university town, many of the Jena Set
also lecturers and professors at the University of Jena. Perhaps a
modern version would have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mountain_College">Black Mountain College</a>.

</p>

<p>
The famous Oxford professor Isaiah Berlin<label id='fnr.95' for='fnr-in.95.4756222' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>95</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.95.4756222' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>95</sup>
Sample perhaps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIffazJIrLo&amp;list=PLhP9EhPApKE_9uxkmfSIt2JJK6oKbXmd-&amp;pp=iAQB">Isaiah Berlin&rsquo;s 1965 lectures on Romanticism</a>,
published later as <i>The Roots of Romanticism</i>.
</span> described Romanticism
as
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a new and restless spirit, seeking <i>violently</i> to burst through old
and cramping forms,<label id='fnr.96' for='fnr-in.96.1667169' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>96</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.96.1667169' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>96</sup>
&#x2026;my italics&#x2026;
</span></li>
<li>a <i>nervous</i> preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of
consciousness,</li>
<li>a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual
movement and change,</li>
<li>an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life,</li>
<li>a <i>passionate</i> effort at self-assertion both individual and
collective,</li>
<li>a search after means of expressing an <i>unappeasable yearning for
unattainable goals</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Especially the last point makes my heroes sound like children who
wanted everything in the candy shop. Again, a mapped intentionality is
implied that my principals most certainly did not bring&#x2014;leading us
once more to the disjunction between latter-day professional analysts
and the original, now grave-mute creators. But then the question
Berlin raised at the beginning of his first lecture, namely, whether
this was really a movement at all&#x2014;or just a collective condition, a
state of mind that is always &ldquo;in the air,&rdquo; to emerge and then fade
like virtual quantum particles blinking in and out of existence.
</p>

<p>
He similarly cannot nail down what any Romanticist in the supposed
middle of the Romanic Era really wanted or was about. Thus, Berlin
imagines interviewing Romanticism proponents of the times&#x2026;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Suppose you had spoken to these persons. You would have found that
their ideal of life was approximately of the following kind. The
values to which they attached the highest importance were such values
as integrity, sincerity, readiness to sacrifice one&rsquo;s life to some
inner light, dedication to some ideal for which it is worth
sacrificing all that one is, for which it is worth both living and
dying. You would have found that they were not primarily interested in
knowledge, or in the advance of science, not interested in political
power, not interested in happiness, not interested, above all, in
adjustment to life, in finding your place in society, in living at
peace with your government, even in loyalty to your king, or to your
republic. You would have found that common sense, moderation, was very
far from their thoughts.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed. To my mind Berlin does cotton on&#x2014;just a bit. And yet he
seems to find the geometry of a path through the wilderness where
there is none, again, just to have scholarly copy.
</p>

<p>
Once I sat down and tried to write something without any prior idea. I
simply asked myself over and over &ldquo;What are you trying to say?&rdquo; And
out came a wild story of a
</p>

<p>
Byron, the Shelleys, writing contest.
</p>


<p>
Again, my question: Where is Dark in any of academe&rsquo;s Romanticism?
And no, I don&rsquo;t mean campy pop gothic. The feelings and emotions
Haworth Emily describe in <i>Fall leaves fall</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br>
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
do not appear in any known academic treatment of Romanticism, forcing
me through this manifesto to start over from scratch. Again, <i>Emily is
not just flipping!</i> When I read her <i>Fall leaves fall</i>, yes, they are
words processed by my brain&rsquo;s logical language model, but then they go
to feelings. This is a quasi-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron">mirror neuron</a> &ldquo;yes, I feel this way too&rdquo;
moment that gives me pause and transports me once again to the gates
of the Dark Muse. <i>Fall leaves fall</i> is terminal&#x2014;I imbibe, feel, and
go forth. I <i>behold</i> all this sublime ideation of darkness and allow
it to carry me&#x2014;and that&rsquo;s it! Haworth Emily infects me with
contagion, and I too smile and sing along with her.
</p>

<p>
Surely we all follow logically-set plans in our lives,
logically-derived &ldquo;goals.&rdquo; But we are simultaneously emotional,
constantly assessing how we <i>feel</i> about this or that, things in
general. This is what I might call the <i>logic train</i> and the <i>emotion
braid</i>. Then when I read <i>Fall leaves fall</i> my braid of emotions
stretching back to my birth (or even further) swells and lifts me
beyond my mundane, deterministic logic train. <i>And it is exactly this
mirroring and swelling that academe doesn&rsquo;t get, never catches
onto</i>. Visions of snowy wreathes and night&rsquo;s decay break away from my
clear, well-lit logic track. <b>But then a new sight emerges, informed
by my emotional faculties</b>.<label id='fnr.97' for='fnr-in.97.4856520' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>97</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.97.4856520' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>97</sup>
A bit of my folk psychology: All twisted (sic), screwed-up
people have one thing in common: They have attempted to wall off some
strand or cut out a section of their emotion braid. They lack
emotional vision.
</span> And so when dealing with academe&rsquo;s
cutting around on Romanticism I must, as Amherst Emily said, <i>beware
of the surgeon with his knife, lest he find the culprit life</i>.

<h4 id="org7d8b5ad">Nature reduced to sentimentality and innocence</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7d8b5ad">
<p>
The indoorsmen of academe never fail to raise <i>nature</i> up as a
hallmark of Romanticism. Nature, nature, nature they repeat&#x2014;but with
only the most patronising view of what it meant to my
principals. Nature what? Nature awareness, appreciation, adulation,
respect, idealisation, idolisation, rapture, fervour, worship? Nature
as the metaphor supply closet, a source of inspiration, a cruel
mistress, a loving mother.<label id='fnr.98' for='fnr-in.98.7279737' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>98</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.98.7279737' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>98</sup>
More about <i>pathetic fallacy</i> soon.
</span> All of this gets batted around
endlessly, again, making my principals seem soppy, dreamy,
sentimental, their lines see-through by us modernist grownups. And so
academe cannot understand Nature as I described it above, i.e., a
non-place; instead, constant everything everywhere cycles of birth,
growth, deterioration, and Death.
</p>

<p>
Academe&rsquo;s favourite Romanticism nature boy is of course William
Wordsworth, whom so many call Romanticism&rsquo;s godfather<label id='fnr.99' for='fnr-in.99.2332334' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>99</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.99.2332334' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>99</sup>
&#x2026;due to ignorance of Novalis? Alas&#x2026;
</span>&#x2014;but
then routinely pan as way-out sappy sentimental. Beholden to the
modern age, its urban nihilist public, not to mention peer reviewers,
modern scholars cannot help but use as touchstones modern realist
writers such as Jack London and Ernest Hemingway and their supposedly
more objective and unvarnished, <i>truer</i> understanding of nature. And
so whatever Wordsworth said about wandering like a cloud then going
nuts over daffodils is seen as affected, mushy, and maudlin
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
That floats on high o&rsquo;er vales and hills,<br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br>
<br>
Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
They stretched in never-ending line<br>
Along the margin of a bay:<br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br>
<br>
The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
A poet could not but be gay,<br>
In such a jocund company:<br>
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>
<br>
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
And dances with the daffodils.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Eye rolls, smirks, and tsk-tsking in today&rsquo;s English department
classrooms. The richer his waxing, the further he sinks into
patronisation and condemnation. Missed entirely is his subtle and
sublime. Here from <i>Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,<br>
In which the burthen of the mystery,<br>
In which the heavy and the weary weight<br>
Of all this unintelligible world,<br>
Is lightened:&#x2014;that serene and blessed mood,<br>
In which the affections gently lead us on,&#x2014;<br>
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame<br>
And even the motion of our human blood<br>
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep<br>
In body, and become a living soul:<br>
While with an eye made quiet by the power<br>
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,<br>
We see into the life of things.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This of course is genial and goes to the heart and soul of what I want
to bring forth here at WutheringUK, even though he hasn&rsquo;t included
Dark. With words he causes vibrations to my emotion braid. But again,
all this goes contrary to modern realism today. One scholar mentioned
in the Wikipedia article on this poem says,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[Wordsworth manages] to see into the life of things only by narrowing
and skewing his field of vision and by excluding certain conflictual
sights and meanings.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Obviously, Wordsworth was a toxic male apologist for the
capitalist industrialist patriarchy, ignoring that so very many women
and minorities were being oppressed exactly when he saw those sights and
penned those lines&#x2026; And so Wordsworth is just a dusty old statue
glimpsed during a quick run-through the classic wing of a museum, more
interesting, better things in the modern wing for sure.
</p>

<p>
Worse, Wordsworth wanted nature the only possible house for human
purity and innocence. In <i>To a Highland Girl</i> he transforms a peasant
shepherdess he saw on a trip to Scotland into a demi-angel
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;With earnest feeling I shall pray<br>
For thee when I am far away:<br>
For never saw I mien, or face,<br>
In which more plainly I could trace<br>
Benignity and home-bred sense<br>
Ripening in perfect innocence.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I guess you had to have been there&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
And so nature for modern realist academe is never more than a <i>theme</i>,
a <i>leitmotif</i>&#x2014;bereft of any clue as to what Nature capitalised
meant.<label id='fnr.100' for='fnr-in.100.5732047' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>100</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.100.5732047' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>100</sup>
&#x2026;and certainly no inkling of what I spoke of above about the
modern indoor-outdoor dichotomy.
</span> Nature conducive to feelings and innocence, inviting
re-sensitisation, indeed, as so much of Romanticist poetry is someone
describing what they <i>feel</i> and <i>yearn</i> while in what they call
<i>Nature</i>. No, modern realists cannot this abide.
</p>

<p>
If one rejects metaphysics in all forms, then Nature has no magic. So
ironic how <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy)">naturalism</a></i> means nature sans any metaphysics, completely
materialist mechanistic from the micro to the macro. Though the term
has the root <i>natural</i>, i.e., the feel of instinctive, genuine,
candid, sincere, e.g., the smile of a dear friend&#x2026; Woe. Alas.
</p>

<p>
This Nature nativism was so often simply reverently noted in verse, as
does Anne Brontë in her <i>Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
My soul is awakened, my spirit is soaring<br>
And carried aloft on the wings of the breeze;<br>
For above and around me the wild wind is roaring,<br>
Arousing to rapture the earth and the seas.<br>
<br>
The long withered grass in the sunshine is glancing,<br>
The bare trees are tossing their branches on high;<br>
The dead leaves beneath them are merrily dancing,<br>
The white clouds are scudding across the blue sky<br>
<br>
I wish I could see how the ocean is lashing<br>
The foam of its billows to whirlwinds of spray;<br>
I wish I could see how its proud waves are dashing,<br>
And hear the wild roar of their thunder to-day!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I will posit that my principals were instinctively, unknowingly,
belatedly stamping a new European nature worship out of the moors and
forest floors&#x2014;necessarily independent of whatever had been the
vernacular paganisms before Roman occupation &#x2026; orthogonal as well to
Elizabethan pastoral lyric, German <i>Shepherd Poetry</i> of the
post-Thirty Years War seventeenth century, or even the Greek Arcadian
<i>Bucolic</i> tradition.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Nature, but again, capitalised. Then we must explore&#x2014;probably
for the rest of our lives&#x2014;how very nuanced their Nature was. Here is
a quote from Haworth Emily
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All creation is equally mad. Nature is an inexplicable problem; it
exists on a principle of destruction. Every being must be the tireless
instrument of death to others, or itself must cease to live. Yet
nonetheless we celebrate the day of our birth, and we praise God for
having entered such a world.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Below I will dive into the three poems which I believe describe her
credo cosmology best. And again, her Nature is completely different
from any modern ideas thereof.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org24e3cbd" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org24e3cbd">Sensitivity</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org24e3cbd">
<p>
Academe wants my principals to have been more in tune with their
senses, more impulsive, less emotionally structured, even sensual. But
once more their approach comes off as patronising, like child
psychologists trying to describe children at play. These doctors know
&ldquo;unruly&rdquo; won&rsquo;t do, so they euphemize cleverly. To be sure, they just
don&rsquo;t get what it is to be instinctual and creative about it. And as
ivory tower residents embedded securely in society, they cannot fathom
being an <i>outsider</i>, neither physically nor
social-psychologically. Tragic how one sort of gifted&#x2014;the analytical
intellectual&#x2014;is so unable to fathom another sort of

In general, academe lacks first-hand experience of what outsiders, the
disadvantaged have of the real world. This dearth of experience is not
made up by imagining the dehumanising and ultimately <i>desensitising</i>
waves coming at, say, the Brontës, the rumour of human exploitation,
the colonialism, as well as capitalist industrialism Wordsworth was
supposed to have known of sitting above Tintern Abbey. More so academe
is master of historical paradigms and movements, making the backdrop
of Enlightenment&rsquo;s cold, relentless dynamism and reductionist
determinism hardly visceral oppressive, especially some two hundred
years in the past. And so I say

<p>
But then am I, your guide, a poet? Dare I correct established,
mainstream Romantic Era experts? Here&rsquo;s something I wrote
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
And from bygone generations I have surely more than blood.<br>
The loom, the wrapped bolt a shared past, holds me taunt.<br>
And try though I may, little hope there is finding out,<br>

For no sooner is some design of<br>
Art, music, words offered than opens<br>
A far greater twilit space echoing the past.<br>
Alas, that these modern conceits must all fail us;<br>
For the Muses range far above, behind, and beyond&#x2014;<br>

The shadowy boundary closing&#x2026;<br>

Long before we slip the concealed gaps.<br>
Death would have all such anticipation quiet&#x2014;<br>
All suppositions. vain assurances flashing then quit,<br>
All expectations rattling, echoing lastly towards stillness<br>

I think this might have got me an honourable mention back in the day.

My poets of yore. And yet no political polemic was ever intended;
rather, by trying to re-humanise, <i>re-sensitise</i>, à la Novalis&rsquo;
poetising, theirs was a more Zen approach, a <i>Euro-Zen</i> perhaps. And
so I write lines to re-collect Feeling, Nature, and Euro Zen
re-sensitisation. But if my principals meant nothing political or
religious, no lifestyle, what did they want? What did they
mean?<label id='fnr.101' for='fnr-in.101.7949751' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>101</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.101.7949751' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>101</sup>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc0121f7">
<p>
As a teen growing up in the early 1970s, I, like everyone around me,
fell in love with the strange, mysterious TV series <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_(1972_TV_series)">Kung Fu</a></i>
(premiere 1972). For a kid in Tennessee it was a pop introduction to
Eastern religion and philosophy. The main character Kwai Chang Caine
was a Chinese-American orphan raised in a Chinese Shaolin Buddhist
monastery in the mid-1800s, who as a young man escaped China to America
after killing an aristocrat. Caine was taught the Kung Fu martial arts
style, but also the whole Buddhist pacifist, non-resistant approach to
life, both of which he uses, episode after episode, as he roams about
the wild west as an aesthete itinerant.
</p>

<p>
I recall getting a book on Zen Buddhism at that time wherein I found
the concept of <i>Unsui</i>, which is Japanese and means <i>cloud,
water</i>. The term also refers to a novice monk
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In Japan, one receives unsui ordination at the beginning of formal
ordained practice, and this is often perceived as &rsquo;novice ordination.&rsquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This dense, written-for-adults book further described unsui
metaphorically, saying water exhibits passive resistance, i.e., it may
change states if impeded: as steam it escapes heat; as water it goes
around impediments; if dammed, it simply waits patiently; or if
frozen, likewise, waits&#x2014;but nothing can stop its eventual movement
to the sea.
</p>

<p>
<i>Kung Fu</i> begins with Caine as a young man killing a nobleman who has
senselessly killed his beloved master. Which of course is the
antithesis of the Buddhist way; hence, Caine must leave the
monastery&#x2014;and China, heading to America. We were all enthralled with
Kwai Chang&rsquo;s adventures, kids and adults alike all looked forward to
each new episode. And yet looking back I can say this extreme Eastern
pacifism is not for me.
</p>

<p>
Buddhism wants enlightenment&#x2014;which supposedly raises us to an
extra-human state. And once enlightened, we no longer should have
worldly cares. But how many actually reach this state&#x2014;which always
sounded like some quasi-permanent version of Dostoyevski&rsquo;s presence of
eternal harmony? This is why I cannot take any sort of Eastern
religion with the stated goal of enlightenment seriously, if for no
other reason than <i>so very few people ever arrive at this
self-actualization</i>. Also, where is Dark in the East?
</p>

<p>
But then what of Western Zen? Emily Brontë&rsquo;s <i>All creation is equally
mad&#x2026;</i> presents a deep paradox and falls into fatalism, rather than
offering a path to anything higher. How could poetised
feelings&#x2014;Longfellow&rsquo;s piteous ruing of snowflakes, Novalis&rsquo;
shout-outs to the night&#x2014;sit atop all the violent dog-eat-dog, all
the smashing, banging, clanging of the real world? How was so-called
Romanticism even to be considered the aesthetics of, the contemporary
cultural offerings to such great upheaval, coercion, destruction as
was the nineteenth-century West? The initial answer is no, it could
not be official aesthetics. There could be no artistic, aesthetic
compliment to colonialism, Newtonian science, industrialism. And
therein lies so much of the irony and paradox. What sense did the
naming of William &ldquo;Dances With Daffodils&rdquo; Wordsworth as the poet
laureate of the British Empire make?<label id='fnr.102' for='fnr-in.102.7179767' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>102</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.102.7179767' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>102</sup>
&#x2026;named in 1843.
</span> No, what the Romantic Era
poets and artists created was, as we might categorise (sic) it, a very
<i>underground</i> aesthetic, an anti-movement that blanched and faded in
the presence of political struggles. The <i>radical philosophers</i>, as
the proto-Marxist activists were called by some, were about power and
wealth, i.e., the haves versus the have-nots. Marxist dialectics then
insisted that when the gradient is too great necessarily the
revolution will begin. Grim was the new industrial urban world with
the once blithely subsistence peasants become wage slaves and living
in the existential terror of squalor, hunger, and exploitation. <i>Homo

</span> had once again raised its terrible head in a new
and awful way. But my principals seemed mute. Or were they?
</p>

<p>
Many opposed what Romanticism seemed to be saying. Goethe and Schiller
promoted as an alternative their <i>Weimar Classicism</i> (more later). To
most, classicism was the best compliment to the modern world,
invariably to imperialism. As in &ldquo;See the wonderful omelette?  Now,
forget all the eggs we broke to make it.&rdquo; Glory, majesty, splendor,
regality, grandeur to justify, substantiate whatever terrible
happenings on the frontiers enabled it. Even more poignant was the
classicist envelope around religion, elevating the huge paradox of
meek, pious, pacifist Christianity as a seemingly stop-at-nothing
empire&rsquo;s real humanistic intentions. All in all, Romanticism could not
be applied anywhere except, maybe, on a walk in Wordworth&rsquo;s Lake
District.

<p>
Novalis promoted a nostalgia for the Medieval Era&#x2014;confusing his
contemporaries. Likewise, Walpole was all in for medieval in his more
melodramatic way. And later, critiques of, e.g., <i>Jane Eyre</i> chided
its nostalgic, rustic appeal for English moorlands.<label id='fnr.104' for='fnr-in.104.3653647' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>104</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.104.3653647' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>104</sup>
Below I will deal with Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s criticism along those
lines.
</span> All
Brontëan writing has the thread of rootedness to the land, which
should be timeless, but then was often seen as all too twee
nostalgic. What then is going on with nostalgia?
</p>

<p>
The Brontë sisters languished in obscurity most of their
lives,<label id='fnr.105' for='fnr-in.105.6775791' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>105</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.105.6775791' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>105</sup>
Oddly enough, the Brontës have been left out of many key
academic analyses of Romanticism. For example, Abrams&rsquo; <i>The Mirror and
the Lamp</i>, Beach&rsquo;s <i>The Concept of Nature in Nineteenth-Century
English Poetry</i>, and Berlin&rsquo;s <i>The Roots of Romanticism</i> make no
mention of them! Maybe they had read <a href="https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Bronte-upload-4.pdf">Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s comments on
<i>Jane Eyre</i></a> and had given them up for a bad job. See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/19/virginia-woolf-in-bronte-country-jane-eyre">this analysis</a> as
well. Big cringe&#x2026;
</span> but as they gained popular recognition in the latter
half of the eighteenth century, Victorian Neo-Romantics kept up with
portraying a softer, kinder Britain from the capitalist industrialist,
imperialist militarist reality. Miss Jane Eyre, suspected of fairy
ancestry, incessantly asked, Who and what am I? Which was answered,
You are a charge of the land. To be sure, my delicate bundle of
English Zen, Dark, Nature, and Christianity was tied by the Brontë
sisters. But could it last could it hold up against the avalanche of
realism and modernism brought on by the acceleration of industrialism
in the late-Victorian Age? Or, from a different angle, How did
Romanticism die?
</p>

<p>
Consider the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (founded in 1848). Below is a
later painting of John Everett Millais, his <i>An Idyll of 1745</i>
</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Everett_Millais#/media/File:An_Idyll_of_1745_(Millais).jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./images/Millais AnIdyllof1745.jpg" width="780" alt="Millais Idyll"></a>
<span class="cap">Before internet social media and hysterical helicopter parents...</span>

<p>
Millais is dealing in what I call <i>profane</i> or <i>vulgar</i>
nostalgia,<label id='fnr.106' for='fnr-in.106.5266294' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>106</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.106.5266294' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>106</sup>
&#x2026;as opposed to <i>sacred</i> nostalgia, i.e., a hearkening,
yearning for the profoundly eternal and epic such as mythos and
legend. In general, nostalgia should not be seen as merely escapism to
the past.
</span> his associations, however, we probably cannot fully
understand today. Of course his Britain of 1745 was powerful after
favourable political events (e.g., Treaty of Utrecht) and Robert
Walpole&rsquo;s era as the first prime minister. And yet 1745 was the year
of the main Jacobite rebellion; hence, the patriotic theme? Though
this was not yet domineering Britain; rather, a Britain still fighting
and scrapping for its position in the world, mainly against the
French, as well as still suffering the collective PTSD of Jacobitism
and the bloody seventeenth-century British civil wars less than a
hundred years earlier. Still, Millais painting this in 1884 would
hearkened back, however vulgarly, to, yes, an <i>idyllic</i> time&#x2014;at
least as he thought provided by the seemingly eternal English
countryside, Britain&rsquo;s first and foremost national treasure. Three
innocent, tabula rasa peasant girls are enraptured by an enlisted man
playing a flute, while a fatherly high-born officer looks on
admiringly. Clearly, this pastoral and class bliss was a version of
Britain longed for by the nostalgia-heavy, Romanticism-influenced
Pre-Raphaelites. Great rueing and regretting permeated Victorian
parlour society vis-à-vis the real world, spurring them to revive the
earlier Romantic Era and to see in nature true vitality and
salvation. See beside as well Millais&rsquo; <i>The Blind Girl</i>.<label id='fnr.107' for='fnr-in.107.1065177' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>107</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.107.1065177' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>107</sup>

</span> This
was the down-home England they wanted, and not the harsh realities of
colonialism and imperialism, and certainly not the horrific suffering
of the urban industrial wastelands Charles Dickens came to chronicle
over and over throughout this time.
</p>

<p>
English Zen and English nostalgia against the unrelenting brutality of
the world. Again, Romanticism&rsquo;s right bookend was supposedly 1850. But
did it die, retire, was it replaced? No, no, and no&#x2014;in part, I would
say, exactly because it was never anything as intentional and
wrappable boxable as the watchers and minders wanted it to
be. Romanticism was like an ongoing silent-bid auction always
interrupted just before the sale. Was Tennyson a Romanticist? What
about Yeats&rsquo; <i>The Stolen Child</i> from 1889
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Come away, O human child!<br>
To the waters and the wild<br>
With a faery, hand in hand,<br>
For the world&rsquo;s more full of weeping than you can understand.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I should also mention James Macpherson&rsquo;s <i>The Poems of Ossian</i>, like
Walpole&rsquo;s <i>Otranto</i>, was the supposed field collections of the
legendary Celtic bard Oisín, although most scholars believe Macpherson
largely composed the poems himself, drawing in part on traditional
Gaelic poetry he had collected. As Wikipedia says
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Though the stories &ldquo;are of endless battles and unhappy loves&rdquo;, the
enemies and causes of strife are given little explanation and
context. Characters are given to killing loved ones by mistake, and
dying of grief, or of joy. There is very little information given on
the religion, culture or society of the characters, and buildings are
hardly mentioned. The landscape &ldquo;is more real than the people who
inhabit it. Drowned in eternal mist, illuminated by a decrepit sun or
by ephemeral meteors, it is a world of greyness.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, Dark, but clearly more of the predominant Medieval Age nostalgia
of the eighteenth century, especially since the authenticity is highly
suspect, i.e., wishful and aggrandising penning on MacPherson&rsquo;s part.

morphed into the social-psychological phenomenon of idolising the
past, vulgar nostalgia selectively reviving, reanimating hoped-for
aspects of the past. Nostalgia&rsquo;s motivation? Again, eighteenth-century
gothic doom paralleled the beginning of the Industrial Revolution&rsquo;s
inflexion point, as well as the reverberations of colonialism, e.g.,
slavery. Doom, where sins&rsquo; ever compounding interest overwhelm any
profits, gains. Here is how J.R.R. Tolkien responded when his fantasy
writings were called escapist
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is
imprisioned by the enemy, don’t we consider it his duty to escape?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
He went on to say the prisoner&rsquo;s natural urge is to escape and run
home. Where is this home? Granted, the intersection of nostalgia and
Dark is minimal, but mist dims light, softens lines, and all nostalgia
involves the obscurants mist and shadow. Nostalgia is mainly for the
thrumming the emotion braid and less for the calibration of the logic
train. But yes, home&#x2014;perhaps the home Jane Eyre described with the
Rivers family on the Northern moorlands? Neo-Victorian Luddite
closet-Monarchist Tolkien was the next stepping stone after George
MacDonald&#x2014;who was a stepping stone after?&#x2026; And yes, it was all
ultimately about home. Ursula Le Guin said an adult is not a dead
child, rather a child that survived. But can that child in us take a
faery hand-in-hand? Faery from our past. Elizabeth Siddal,

Perhaps my Romantic Era principals sensed the hyper-individualistic,
the utilitarian, the reptilian mindset coming from the middle-class
capitalist industrialists as an egregious desensitisation regime
spreading throughout society, and so they threw re-sensitisation at
it. The stereotypical middle-class industrialist rising during the
Enlightenment was a pragmatic utilitarian who, after absorbing the
message of Adam Smith&rsquo;s <i>The Wealth of Nations</i> (1776), had shunned

the consummate self-reliant individualist exclusively laser-focused on
financial wealth. These men projected a stripped-down emotional
psychological persona, indeed, a new desensitisation
regime. Capitalism, Marxism, modernism in general dispensed with
traditional aesthetics, forcing my principals to shore up an
aesthetical foundation. But as I say, there was no call to political
action, just their strange pacifist yet fatalist English Zen.

in turn, <i>real</i> culture may be found. The Western Hemisphere, however,
has no real time dimension, thus, relatively speaking, no history,
which leaves a phantom-limb-like pain in our collective
psyches. Indeed, great historical vectors in this four-space can still
be found in certain corners of the Old World. Yes, the Buddhism,
Taoism, Hinduism of the Far East draw us in with their four-space
depth and vibrancy. And yes, I very much believe the human ultimately
needs true culture and yearns to be in this four-dimensional
space. But first the story behind this theory&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Back in 1982 I was working and studying at the Swiss Polytech in
Zürich, Switzerland, living in a small Zürich student dormitory among
mainly Europeans, most of whom were, oddly enough, German exchange
students.<label id='fnr.113' for='fnr-in.113.3904119' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>113</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.113.3904119' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>113</sup>
&#x2026;many of whom were theology students come to study the
Swiss Protestant movement, i.e., Zwingli and the Anabaptists.
</span> One March evening, a group of us found ourselves
watching the American Oscar awards ceremony on television. It was all
very cringe embarrassing for me the only American, the spectacle
cryptically America-centric, very bombastic and off-putting. Though to
my surprise what ensued was not just anti-American spleen-venting,
rather, a very mature, objective discussion as to why the Hollywood
entertainment industry was so big and powerful and influential;
indeed, so dominant and important that its film award ceremony would
be shown on prime-time Swiss television. Scales fell from my eyes as
my Eastern Hemisphere colleges came up with the basis of this three-
versus four-dimension theory. The verdict was Americans&#x2014;lacking true
history, thus, real culture&#x2014;devote their attention, energy, brain
cycles to a very fierce and intense scramble to control and dominate
the present moment, the here-and-now. Thus, controlling the Zeitgeist
was all that was left in our three-dimensional space, the results
being just so much meaningless <i>churn</i>, come-and-go subculture of
little or no permanence.
</p>

<p>
Ever since this revelation and other similar Saul-to-Paul moments,
ever since returning from my all but total assimilation into
especially the German mindset, I&rsquo;ve been out of synch with my country
of origin.<label id='fnr.114' for='fnr-in.114.6552547' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>114</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.114.6552547' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>114</sup>
Jokingly I claim to have been <i>verdeutscht</i>, or &ldquo;germanised,&rdquo;
the prefix <i>ver-</i> usually shading negative, e.g., <i>ver</i>-dorben
meaning ruined. But then I found out Luther had coined the term back
in the sixteenth century to describe his translation of the Bible from
Latin into German.
</span> Recognising that great swaths of our Americanisms
are really only lowest-common-denominator Zeitgeist wrangling and
subculture churn, I&rsquo;ve come to cleave to the permanence I encountered
in the Eastern Hemisphere, Europe, the home of my ancestors. Call me
<i>Eurocentric</i>. But again, this traditionalism, this Old World
mentality clashes mightily with the common American relativist
attitude, i.e., that culture is whatever we say it is. And who gets to
say what it is?  To be sure, the strong, domineering personalities who
have embedded themselves in media gatekeeping and influencer positions
say what is what.
</p>

<p>
Then came the 1984 film <i>Amadeus</i> and, again, a big discussion took
off in my Zürich dorm. The prevailing attitude of the Europeans was
thumbs down, and, once again, I had a road to Damascus<label id='fnr.115' for='fnr-in.115.9962660' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>115</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.115.9962660' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>115</sup>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_of_Paul_the_Apostle">conversion of Paul</a> reference.
</span> moment
where I learned another huge New World versus Old World difference,
namely, that when the supposedly mean, repressive Emperor Joseph II
was complaining of &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/H6_eqxh-Qok?si=NCTGZKyn_BzTI9b1">too many notes</a>,&rdquo; he was simply voicing a typically
age-old <i>stasis</i> attitude. Of course musicologists can say exactly
what the tastes were back then, but my Old Worlders explained that an
Austrian emperor of that time was in charge of a land and society
where capitalism, high-tech mass consumerism, and any sort of dynamic
modernisms as we know them today were unknown. That is to say, theirs
was a reality predicated on maintaining balance and stasis. Why?
Simply put, tight resources necessitated tight social constraints and
norms. And so in a pre-modern era all manner of &ldquo;progress&rdquo; had to be
measured against what it may cost, what it might upset. This was my
introduction to what <i>monarchism</i> really was about&#x2014;totally
overthrowing my American and Hollywood indoctrination where
aristocrats were always depicted as selfish, despotic
hedonists.<label id='fnr.116' for='fnr-in.116.989847' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>116</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.116.989847' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>116</sup>
<a href="https://youtu.be/gUevJ492LSw?si=A4qJKnf4LX_d4zlE">This</a> is a tolerable scene in the otherwise hideous <i>The
Favourite</i> depiction of Queen Anne.
</span> Monarchism, as it was explained to me, was first and
foremost about resource conservation &#x2026; and all other human behaviour
then following from that pre-high-tech, pre-fossil-fuel, pre-industrialist,
pre-imperialist resource exploitation reality. Once again scales from
eyes. From then on I saw monarchism in a new light. Monarchism as
stasis maintenance, while our modern mentality is <i>Amadeus</i>, i.e.,
Mozart the heroic revolutionist overthrowing stuffy old conventions to
boldly strike out into new territory for the benefit of all. I had
grown up believing nothing could be better than freedom and liberty;
hence, nothing that restricts the individual should be tolerated. But
as I learned there was another side to the story&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I can now sum up my attitude about monarchism&#x2014;yes, I&rsquo;m a
monarchist&#x2014;with a joke about God and the devil meeting in their
favourite pub and having a beer. One evening at the pub the devil was
all excited about his &ldquo;new ideas&rdquo; for humanity. He told God about
<i>democracy</i> and how grand it would be. God, however, was skeptical
and, pulling his long beard, asked, &ldquo;Hmmm, so what does this democracy
do for a living?&rdquo; The devil became even more animated, &ldquo;Oh, my
<i>second</i> new idea, capitalism!&rdquo;  &#x2026; which he proceeded to
explain. God, however, grumbled about how they did not sound better
than monarchism, that it was probably just another ploy to win more
souls away from heaven&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
These foundations of the Old World have been very slowly developing
like the old-fashioned film in my head. And so here I am, almost to my
seventh decade on this earth, an Old-World Luddite and monarchist. As
I now see it, our modern, open-ended resource and energy extraction
orgy cannot go on much longer. Really though, how can more and more
people consuming more and more resources and energy actually work?
Sure, for a few generations maybe, but certainly the bill is coming
due. At some point no amount of Elon Musk&rsquo;s or Bill Gates&rsquo; high-tech
white-knighting will keep us kicking this profligate resource
consumption whale down the beach. This means a very different way of
life must soon be found, re-discovered. Thus, I now believe in a very
fundamentalist proto-conservatism&#x2014;all stemming from, based upon the
resource conservation reality we face, we have always faced on this
planet. And yet we in the twenty-first century find ourselves in
humanity&rsquo;s most precarious state ever, due mainly to our science and
technology ingenuity creating a false sense of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornucopianism">cornucopia</a></i>, which
falsely floats a narrative of eternal growth. Parallel to this
reckless liberalisation of resource consumption is liberalisation of
society, which likewise is showing clear signs of degeneracy and
dysfunctionality. One aphorism might be
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The bigger the dance floor, the wilder and crazier the dancing.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We in America have certainly created the biggest dance floor the world
has ever seen, and our politicians make endless promises of <b>freedom</b>
and <b>liberty</b> and <b>prosperity</b>, the <i>Big Three</i>, as I call them. I
mean to make a break with this madness starting with clearing out
these western Eastern attitudes of &ldquo;live in the moment mindfulness,&rdquo;
which to me is just the latest product on the <i>boutique lifestyle</i>
shelf. What does &ldquo;live in the moment&rdquo; mean to the typical American? It
means don&rsquo;t worry about the consequences of wasteful, immoderate
behaviour and don&rsquo;t let the past inform or constrain you. How utterly
and completely ridiculous!
</p>

<p>
Again, we sorely miss the fourth dimension and we crave
authenticity&#x2014;and yet we have made from the various Old World
paradigms only fake knock-offs, western appropriations that sell at
the American lifestyle boutique. Alas. <b>I insist one may not simply
drop his past, his fate, his doom to take up with some exotic culture,
aesthetics, belief system not of his own soil, not of his blood and
history.</b> I realise this is a serious, restrictive &ldquo;stay in your lane&rdquo;
way of seeing life, but one becoming clearly necessary for our actual
survival.
</p>

<p>
My Dark Muse says life is life, not just any mix-and-match lifestyles
one may fancy from near and far. And yes, everything I&rsquo;ve ever seen
appropriated from especially the Far East typically winds up as
come-and-go fads flogged by would-be trend-setters. Worse, we now see
what some are calling <i>Cultural Marxism</i>,<label id='fnr.117' for='fnr-in.117.8120392' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>117</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.117.8120392' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>117</sup>
According to Wikipedia, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory">Cultural Marxism</a> is a scurrilous
far-right conspiracy theory. I merely use it as a catch-all for what
indeed seems a broad and thoroughly amoral, nihilist attack on Western
culture and values in the classic agitprop Marxist sense. Obviously,
anti-Western sentiment is not some planned political campaign, rather,
a long-in-the-making descent from a Western zenith such as the British
Victorian Era. More as we go along&#x2026;
</span> i.e., an intentional
eviscerating our traditions and Western culture. Striking a rebel chic
pose has now joined passivist seekerdom, causing even more erosion of
our Western traditions. Today more than ever it has become
fashionable, even great virtue to ditch one&rsquo;s own traditions and try
another&rsquo;s in some misguided show of humility out to barefaced
defiance. We see this <i>virtue signalling</i> as atonement for complicity
in past racist, imperialist sins. &ldquo;Look at me, I&rsquo;m not Western, I&rsquo;m
<i>&lt;insert politically-correct posturing here&gt;</i>.&rdquo; But how does this
really help?
</p>

<p>
With Western culture and traditions on the run, we are encouraged to
be multi-racial and especially multi-cultural, treating the globe&rsquo;s
non-Western faire like so many exotic dishes at a great pot luck to
which we, of course, do not bring anything from our own kitchen. And
so I ask, How can such a cultural mooch be trusted? Already, the rest
of the world no longer trusts us.
</p>

<p>
Again, I&rsquo;m especially against western Eastern because it has made the
most inroads in my society.<label id='fnr.118' for='fnr-in.118.9577920' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>118</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.118.9577920' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>118</sup>
Interesting how the whole African-American &ldquo;roots&rdquo; thing has
all but died away. And Middle Eastern in the form of Islamic
fundamentalism also has passed its peak and is seeing heavy push-back
in America and Europe.
</span> My Dark Muse is simply
incompatible with all the stolen products of the East. I will not
throw away my history and traditions, for in them is my reality, my
inescapable <b>doom</b>. The way of the Universe is entropy, and we humans
realise this as doom. Yes, <b>I have doom, I have fate. I do not have
karma</b>. And this doom is comprised of the strands of my actual
history, but also my emotion braid, necessarily reaching back into the
past. I therefore own, I embody sins, failures, misfortune, but also
yearnings, longings. I carry all I have done, inherit all from which I
have come down. I live down, I live on, and I live with Nature,
necessarily locally.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you drink tea, and you&rsquo;re a Christian; and what about spices and
tobacco and opium and rubber and&#x2026;&rdquo; you might counter. Yes, yes, yes;
however, some of these &ldquo;imports&rdquo; have stood the test of time becoming
westernised. Though truly some should be dropped. Exotic is
suspect. But yes, I can say we&rsquo;ve westernised Christianity, made it
our own. This will annoy many, but I insist Christianity is <i>not</i> a
universalist, drop-in belief system, but necessarily becomes
interwoven with, shaped by the people and their land. In <i>Jane Eyre</i>
Charlotte Brontë makes this very clear in her criticisms of St John
Rivers who thinks he needs to become a missionary to India, instead of
just staying in his little moorland village and being spiritual
shepherd to his flock.<label id='fnr.119' for='fnr-in.119.1140223' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>119</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.119.1140223' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>119</sup>
Just below I speak of how Emily Brontë <i>poetises</i>
Christianity, thereby roping it together with pagan Nature and the
Dark Muse. She creates a layering of all three. Indeed&#x2026;
</span> Charlotte makes Pastor St John out as
an aloof, emotionally anorexic, theology-bound British imperialist. I
see a much different take on Christian belief through many of the
nineteenth century poets, Christina Rossetti and the Brontës. And no,
I cannot gainsay them; rather, I try to understand their unique and
subtle understanding of Christianity. Local, responsive, poetised
Christianity versus abstract universalist &ldquo;export&rdquo; Christianity.
</p>

<p>
Are there things we in the West can learn from the East?
Irrelevant. I say this is a slippery slope we need to stay off. I
contend we can never truly know Eastern beyond hearsay, beyond
idealisations. Alone that the vast majority of us having no actual
experience with the real India or Far East, culturally, genetically,
geographically. And I reject the prima facie tourist&rsquo;s encounter, even
extended-stay tourism. The example of the British Empire and all those
Englishmen supposedly &ldquo;gone bush&rdquo; in those far-flung exotic
places&#x2014;T.E. Lawrence in Arabia, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj">British Raj</a> on the Indian
Subcontinent, as well as other far-flung places.<label id='fnr.120' for='fnr-in.120.4050638' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>120</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.120.4050638' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>120</sup>
British writer Anthony Burgess once told of his experience of
the British military turning a blind eye to opium use amongst the
troops stationed in Southeast Asia due to the overwhelming alienation
and dysphoria.
</span> Ultimately,
who has influenced whom? One might argue both the other, supposedly to
good ends. Really though. Today&rsquo;s educated Indians can speak English,
but I see little of real British culture that has lasted; more rather,
India threw British imperialism off like a bad cold.<label id='fnr.121' for='fnr-in.121.4821788' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>121</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.121.4821788' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>121</sup>
A good example would be the critically-acclaimed film
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_Wallah">Shakespeare Wallah</a></i>, which deals with the sudden irrelevance of
English culture in post-British Raj India.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And now it&rsquo;s time to discuss Protestant Calvinism, a very cold shower
indeed on the warm, fuzzy western Eastern.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org7a906a6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7a906a6">Reformed Christianity versus Buddhist enlightenment</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7a906a6">
<p>
One glaring difference between East and West can be seen in the
Calvinist Reformed beliefs of what the human is to, may know of
God&#x2014;which, as the Protestants would say, is not very much. To
Calvinists, God is infinite, thus, finite humans are incapable of
comprehending an infinite being, full stop. Contrast this with the
Eastern concept of Eastern enlightenment, i.e., a human reaching a
quasi-God-like state. In Protestant Christianity there can be no
master or guru having more spiritual maturity than a novice. And so
the fatalism of we are all sinners in the eyes of God.<label id='fnr.122' for='fnr-in.122.5857025' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>122</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.122.5857025' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>122</sup>
Romans 3:23: For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.
</span> Also in
Protestantism, we may know God only through scripture&#x2014;and then only
through that proverbial glass darkly.<label id='fnr.123' for='fnr-in.123.6679565' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>123</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.123.6679565' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>123</sup>
Paul&rsquo;s First Epistle to the Corinthians 13:12.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Of course this creates a huge gradient between human and supreme
being, In Calvinism there is no attainable state of god-like being and
knowing. Which again is diametrically opposed to Eastern
enlightenment&#x2014;satori, nirvana. Case in point, the Reformation
pointedly rejected Catholic metaphysics whereby thousands of saints
supposedly had spiritual experiences. Protestantism has no saints&#x2014;or
at least very few. Rarely does <i>Saint</i> preface a disciple or apostle.
All metaphysics is contained in the Bible, and nothing supernatural or
mystical since is acknowledged.
</p>

<p>
Protestant belief is clearly more fatalistic than Roman Catholic. From
the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_sin">Original Sin</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Protestant reformers such as Martin Luther and John Calvin equated
original sin with <i>concupiscence</i> (or &ldquo;hurtful desire&rdquo;), affirming that
it persisted even after baptism and completely destroyed freedom to do
good, proposing that original sin involved a loss of free will except
to sin.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We are fallen and banished from the Garden until further notice. Our
mortal coil, our bundle of mortality, sinfulness, and waywardness is
our prison while on earth, and any attempt at climbing up the sides of
life&rsquo;s container is futile. And herein lies a stasis mentality at the
spiritual belief level, a holding pattern at this grossly lower state
of mortal life&#x2014;at least until the Second Coming of Christ.
</p>

<p>
I must admit my Dark Muse resonates with this doomy sort of
Christianity
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy
conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire
shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. <br>
&#x2014;Genesis 3:16
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is biblical anthropology supposedly explaining why childbirth is
so painful, even deadly for us. Undeniably, the West is
Judaeo-Christian, the Bible&#x2014;half Jewish scriptural history, half
Jesus and post-Jesus hagiography&#x2014;contains large amounts of woe and
suffering,
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and
gnashing of teeth. <br>
&#x2014;Matthew 13:42
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And of course calamitous Job
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have
taken hold upon me. My bones are pierced in me in the night season:
and my sinews take no rest. By the great force of my disease is my
garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat. He
hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes. <br>
&#x2014;Job 30:16-19

<p>
In the Book of Job I take the lesson, the admonishment that <i>we are no
better off than Job</i>. I then build out by saying <i>we are not better
than /anyone</i> of the past simply for being concomitant with modern
scientific discovery and high technology. Yes, biblical characters may
sound like ignorant, superstitious hicks; but then I ask, are we any
better, any different just for sitting on our modern perches? My
answer is
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose
his own soul? <br>
&#x2014;Matthew 16:26
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
or, less Christian preachy, What do we get from modernism and
high-technology, from our huge, liberalised dance floor if these boons
wind up destroying our minds, our hearts, and the good green Earth
around us? I have come to despair at this pervasive attitude that
through evermore modern high-tech materialism in these urban
space-colony-like settings we are getting anywhere close to any sort
of self-realisation. We certainly are not. In fact, we are going
backwards into a collective madness. What then to do? I contend Emily
Brontë, my little &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; bat eking out her living, gained a clue,
one precious clue.

<div id="outline-container-org95d7a4f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org95d7a4f">The totality of Emily Brontë</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org95d7a4f">
<p>
Here I will simply and plainly state that Emily Jane Brontë
is the very centre of my Dark Muse. She embodies for me the heart and
soul of Romanticism, but ironically stands mostly outside of any Romanticism
boxing or packaging. And yet it is her <i>poetry</i>, not her book that
makes her my leader.
</p>

<p>
Strangely enough I say forget her book <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, which for
me is just gothic novel handle-cranking, however artistically
potent. As before, I suspect an inevitable inability for prose to do
what poetry does. Likewise, Poe lost much altitude when he would
switch from poetry to prose. That is to say, Brontë and Poe said deep
and lasting things in their verse, but simply added pulp to the gothic
novel shelf with their prose. I say Dark cannot be captured in
story. Of course the human is very narrative-oriented, but a story
must be of legend gestalt. Thus, when we tell a story it must be a
legend. All other storytelling leads to confusion and ultimately
madness. And where did I get this idea? From a drunken Native American
on the Blackfoot Reservation many years ago.
</p>

<p>
Let me start by saying she combined in her
<i>poetry</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Pagan Nature</b>,</li>
<li><b>Dark</b>, and</li>
<li><b>Christianity</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
and in keeping with Keats&rsquo; <i>Negative Capability</i> she did not let any
one or two overshadow the other two or one. <b>Like a frontier one-room
school teacher, she forced the rowdy peasant boys Dark, pagan Nature,
and Christianity to sit close enough on the school bench to smell each
other.</b>
</p>

<p>
It is in these three poems
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>The night is darkening round me</i> (once more),</li>
<li><i>I&rsquo;ll come when thou art saddest</i> and</li>
<li><i>I would have touched the heavenly key</i></li>
</ul>

<p>
which appear clumped together as poem <i>31.</i> in <i>Emily Brontë The Complete
Poems</i> from Penguin Classics where she intentionally, unintentionally?
lays out her whole philosophy of life
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>

Nor earth nor sea nor cloudless sky –
But only spirit wandering wide
Through infinite immensity.

Class’d among creatures, when the soul can flee,
And with the sky, the peak, the heaving plain
Of ocean, or the stars, mingle, and not in vain.

Academe&rsquo;s take on Romanticism&#x2014;a very big elephant in the middle of
the room, indeed. What to do with this beast wont to co-opt and usurp
my genial, gifted principals, and, in general, completely miss my Dark
Muse? To be sure, academe <i>completely</i> misses the Dark Muse,
incessantly pigeon-holing it as gothic fright&#x2014;or just missing it
entirely. Again, one of the main tasks of WutheringUK is to get Dark
out of its academe and popular media prisons. Foremost is how academe
Romanticism seems more the labeling work of these clueless busy-bodies
than any intentional movement from the actual creators.<label id='fnr.124' for='fnr-in.124.4968673' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>124</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.124.4968673' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>124</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., we would never have known Emily Brontë&rsquo;s poetry had
not sister Charlotte pilfered her manuscripts from their hiding place
and published them without her sister&rsquo;s permission. Similarly, the
reclusive Emily Dickinson only half-heartedly ever sought
publication. During her life only ten poems were published, but after
her death <i>over a thousand</i> were discovered in her room and
subsequently published. In general, how many Barbaulds, Brontës,
Dickinsons, Poes didn&rsquo;t make the recognition cut?
</span> Which
begs the question posed by the highly-respected twentieth-century
humanities professor Isaiah Berlin in his lecture series on
Romanticism whether those times were not something timeless, a
permanent state of mind wholly outside of anyone&rsquo;s historical fence
work.<label id='fnr.125' for='fnr-in.125.1515196' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>125</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.125.1515196' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>125</sup>
Academe typically fences the Romantic Era in between 1800
and 1850.
</span> Nevertheless, there is no avoiding the sweeping
intellectualisations, the mountains of churn from Romanticism&rsquo;s
academic investigators. And as I say, <i>none</i> of them get Dark; and in
general, the more they think they know, the less they actually
do. Thus, the cleft between what Romanticism scholars say we are
reading and what you or I might simply feel upon reading can be
huge. And again, that is my whole point here.
</p>

<p>
Too often scholars are all over the map with pontifications and
theories. For example, Andrea Wulf in her <i>Magnificent Rebels</i> depicts
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe as a sort of adult-supervision den dad of
Jena Set, and yet here is something he actually said about
Romanticism
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Klassisch ist das Gesunde, romantisch das Kranke &#x2026; or
&#x2026; Romanticism is disease. It is the weak, the sickly, the battle cry
of a school of wild poets and Catholic reactionaries; whereas
classicism is strong, fresh, gay, sound, like Homer and the
<i>Nibelungenlied</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I won&rsquo;t accuse Wulf of poor research or intentional
obfuscation. Having been a founder of <i>Sturm und Drang</i>, perhaps we
should grant Goethe the right to have been of two minds. Perhaps he
was initially attracted to the Jena buzz, all the <i>haute pensée</i>
sprung up in his backyard, but then soured on its content,
implications, the personalities behind it. Certainly Schiller
did. Still, this is a prime example of how diverse, even contradictory
Romantic Era scholarship can be.
</p>

<p>
Yes, many contemporaries of the actual artistic producers helped talk
Romanticism into existence&#x2014;the Jena Set, Coleridge, Germaine de
Staël, Emerson et al.&#x2014;but again, I believe the actual principals
were far-sighted, inward-gazing, quasi-timeless unicorns not following
guidelines or living up to anybody&rsquo;s expectations.<label id='fnr.126' for='fnr-in.126.82138' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>126</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.126.82138' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>126</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., the Brontës were pastor&rsquo;s daughters in rural West
Yorkshire with little exposure to (taint from?) the cultural and
literary buzz of the cities.
</span> &#x2026; and most
certainly they did not &ldquo;write to spec&rdquo; or pastiche, as was fairly
obviously the case with gothic horror novelists. <i>And so I say sifting
through all the academic chaff gets us nowhere versus simply reading
and silently contemplating the product itself.</i> All for naught is
listing facts and figures, creating categories and pigeonholes,
imagining commonalities, generalities, throwing a formulaic hyperspace
over the lone wolf creators. Caveat emptor. If the purpose of a poem,
as Keats said, is to embolden the soul to accept mystery, then such
analytical death marches must be seen as antithetical. Analysing
mystery is a fool&rsquo;s errand. For me at least, the principals
<i>re-sensitised</i>, while their describers have only managed to
<i>de-sensitise</i> with their mystery-deaf approach.
</p>

<p>
Some insight comes from two men of this era who unfortunately wore
both hats, i.e., creator and explainer, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and
Edgar Allan Poe. With them we see their creations take us into the
ephemeral mists of Romanticism&rsquo;s subtleties and sublimities, while
their intellectualizations and pontifications thereof sound windy, if
not shrill out to ridiculous. No wonder the concept of left-brain,
right-brain arose,<label id='fnr.127' for='fnr-in.127.3431587' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>127</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.127.3431587' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>127</sup>
The best ideas about left/right brain are those of Iain
McGilchrist. Try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK7XG3t2nFg&amp;list=PLqBHk3itxyPDKFnwj8-SmlwHra64cCrky&amp;pp=iAQB">these</a>.
</span> as nothing else can describe this
split-personality confusion. But the urban salons necessarily
trafficked in rational, left-brain talk and copy. And this is for me
the <i>crisis of Romanticism</i>, i.e., the huge divide between the
creators and their content versus the describers and promoters. Yes Mr
Keats, we shall luxuriate long in the water, but then slowly, gently
swim back to the shore to gracefully and silently rise out of the
water and stand exulted for the whole experience. Of course we cannot
luxuriate in the lake forever, but upon exiting we must somehow hold
the experience in awe and reverence and not grasp for logical
explanations, which can only turn it into a show, a farce, even so, a
sham, a carcass.

Today a hit song or a brain-dead TikTok video can go globally &ldquo;viral&rdquo;
in less than a day, with imitations instantly springing up like
mushrooms after rain. But in the closing years of the eighteenth
century there just seemed to be something in the air, which came to be
called Romanticism, apparently first by Jena Set founder Friedrich
Schlegel<label id='fnr.128' for='fnr-in.128.514027' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>128</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.128.514027' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>128</sup>
<a href="https://engines.egr.uh.edu/english-romanticism/what-romanticism">This</a> will save you some googling. Note again the tortured
origin of the term <i>romantic</i>.
</span> &#x2026; after Coleridge and Wordsworth&rsquo;s collaboration
<i>Lyrical Ballads</i> (first edition) appeared in 1798 and Novalis&rsquo; <i>HttN</i>
in 1800. But again, my principle principal, Emily Brontë, who wrote
decades later, arguably knew very little to absolutely nothing about
Jena, Novalis, or even much of Coleridge and Wordsworth other than
perhaps a reading of their <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. Even later, Poe had
supposedly encountered translations of Ludwig Tieck&rsquo;s short
stories. Otherwise, there had not been much cross-fertilisation,
rather, the Romanticism Muse was, yes, just something in the air.
</p>

<p>
<i>Early German Romanticism</i><label id='fnr.129' for='fnr-in.129.2653827' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>129</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.129.2653827' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>129</sup>
For what it&rsquo;s worth, German Romanticism can be broken down
into Jena, Heidelberg, then Berlin Romanticism based largely on the
principle artists.
</span> began when Novalis&rsquo; <i>HttN</i> burst
upon the scene in the very first year of the nineteenth century. Clear
to me, however, is that <i>HttN</i> was a one-off that came out of the
blue, thus, certainly not intentional, positioned for, or tailored to
any specific trend or agenda. Contrast this with Goethe&rsquo;s play
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Tauris_(Goethe)">Iphigenia in Tauris</a></i> (versions in 1779, 1781, 1786), based on
Euripides&rsquo; original, which was specifically meant to showcase Goethe&rsquo;s
ideal of a modern classicism, i.e., his and Friedrich Schiller&rsquo;s
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Classicism">Weimar Classicism</a>. But the <i>Jena Set</i>, centred around the Schlegel
brothers, August Wilhelm and Friedrich, along with August&rsquo;s wife
Caroline, seized upon the mostly absentee Novalis as their boy wonder
<i>Liebling</i> mascot&#x2014;and the conflation of producer and describers
began in earnest. But just one year after <i>HttN</i> appeared, Novalis
died on them. Though the seed sprouted and the Jena Set went on to
create an entire mountain range of Jena Romanticism which had little
to do with their boy-man hero Novalis. After philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte">Johann
Gottlieb Fichte</a> fell out of favour, the young, dynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling">Friedrich
Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling</a> came on board, and it is his <i>nature
philosophy</i> which became Jena Romanticism&rsquo;s house brand, eventually
adopted and promoted by Coleridge (sometimes as literal translation as
in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographia_Literaria">Biographia Literaria</a> - 1817), then by Emerson and the
Transcendentalists in the Colonies. Again, all of this churn misses
Dark entirely.

<img src="images/Edgar_Allan_Poe,_circa_1849,_restored,_squared_off.jpg" alt="Edgar_Allan_Poe,_circa_1849,_restored,_squared_off.jpg">
</span> Alas but the Wikipedia
description of DR trots out all the negative stereotypes of Dark. As
one biographer noted, Poe struggled all his short adult life to make a
living as a writer and poet. One supposed quote of his said
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Your writer of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big
pen, with a very blunt nib.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My take on Poe was that, as I said above, he led a Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde
literary existence. The American publishing world was rarely
supportive, as one historian said, eager to move on from Dark and
gothic. And yet Poe always seemed to find audiences.
</p>

<p>
Poe&rsquo;s best known poem was <i><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven">The Raven</a></i>, which wound through the
publishing world&#x2014;mainly periodicals and newspapers&#x2014;throughout
1845, finally landing in a collection of Poe&rsquo;s poems in the summer
of 1845. Back in the day, school children would learn by heart at
least the first stanza
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore&#x2014;<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door&#x2014;<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Only this and nothing more.”<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
and if you were a good student, perhaps even the second stanza
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Nameless here for evermore.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
then of course <i>&#x2026;’Tis the wind and nothing more&#x2026;</i> and other such
snatches. And for youth poetry reciting contests <i>The Raven</i> has been
a standard. But through all this we have what is basically a throwback
to the doom-and-gloom Graveyard School gothic, i.e., not informed by
Barbauld&rsquo;s finer sort of Dark. Then came the next year Poe&rsquo;s fateful
essay entitled <i>The Philosophy of Composition</i> wherein he attempted to
reverse-engineer what he did to come up with <i>The Raven</i>. Here&rsquo;s a
portion
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of
ill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word &ldquo;Nevermore&rdquo; at the
conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length
about one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object-
supremeness or perfection at all points, I asked myself, &ldquo;Of all
melancholy topics what, according to the universal understanding of
mankind, is the most melancholy?&rdquo;  Death, was the obvious reply. &ldquo;And
when,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?&rdquo; From
what I have already explained at some length the answer here also is
obvious, &ldquo;When it most closely allies itself to Beauty: The death then
of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the
world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for
such topic are those of a bereaved lover.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alas, but I just cannot accept that he created <i>The Raven</i> on some
poetry conveyor belt, speaking of Death capitalised, then death of a
woman almost as if a gimmick. Again, alas. It gets worse
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Most writers&#x2014;poets in especial&#x2014;prefer having it understood that
they compose by a species of fine frenzy&#x2014;an ecstatic intuition&#x2014;and
would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the
scenes, at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought, at the
true purposes seized only at the last moment, at the innumerable
glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view, at the
fully-matured fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable, at the
cautious selections and rejections, at the painful erasures and
interpolations&#x2014;in a word, at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for
scene-shifting, the step-ladders, and demon-traps, the cock&rsquo;s
feathers, the red paint and the black patches, which, in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, constitute the properties of the literary
histrio [actor, player].
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Cringe. He sounds ashamed about falling into a state of &ldquo;ecstatic
intuition,&rdquo; as if he has peers around whom he had better not sound too
airy-floaty. Or maybe he wanted to say, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas nothing. Just follow my
formula, and you too can write a nice, dark poem that&rsquo;ll have them all
weeping.&rdquo; Once more, cringe, alas.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I do believe <i>The Raven</i> came from something
ecstatic&#x2014;out to trance and vision. Again, Poe was simply an erratic
character who seemed to change personalities often. But sometimes I
want <i>The Raven</i> to be about the death of Romanticism. If academe says
the right bookend was circa 1850, then perhaps I could read lamenting
of the passing of an era symbolised by a beautiful, virtuous woman
Leanore into the lines. Allow me, please.
</p>

<p>
And so here I want to make a very important point about my principals,
to be sure, <b>that they were only vessels</b>, those particular mortals
the Muses chose to be their emissaries. This angle is well developed
in the Hollywood film <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)">Amadeus</a></i> where Mozart<label id='fnr.131' for='fnr-in.131.8932488' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>131</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.131.8932488' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>131</sup>
Child Wolfgang and sister Maria Anna <br>

<br>
</span> was depicted as an
immature, outta-control brat and yet the conduit of heavenly music. As
alluded above, Novalis was likely just such a boy-wonder Amadeus sort,
Poe no doubt lashing out mercurial, Emily Brontë austere anorexic,
Emily Dickinson a spinster recluse. Looking too closely into their
personal stories typically gets us no closer to discovering the
origins of their inspiration&#x2014;another academe dead end. Like the
writer and artist Kahil Gibran said about children in his <i>The
Prophet</i>, they come <i>through</i> you, they are not <i>of</i> you.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I believe Poe&rsquo;s own description of his &ldquo;place of creative
origin&rdquo; describes it best. He once mentioned the state of having
&ldquo;thoughts behind thoughts.&rdquo; Which is something I found described in a
<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/neuregulin-1-genie-und-schizophrenie-moeglicherweise-folge-eines-gens-a-870089.html"><i>Der Spiegel</i> article</a> from 2012 about the link between creativity and
<b>schizophrenia</b>. Basically, an &ldquo;expression&rdquo; of the gene Neuregulin 1
(NRG1), which supposedly is key in regulating &ldquo;synaptic plasticity&rdquo; is
sometimes amiss, but not so amiss that full-on schizophrenia
results. Instead of full debilitation with phantom voices and raging
paranoia, a &ldquo;schizoid lite&rdquo; sufferer will have the hidden underground
river of wild disassociated thoughts, but be able to control it. Once
I read this Der Spiegel article scales fell from my eyes&#x2014;it
described me! Here is an example of a poem I wrote
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Dark burgundy roses, cobalt irises<br>
Delivered for the night&rsquo;s performance,<br>
To the theatre in the hollow, <b><i>le théâtre de la combe</i></b>.<br>
City-bound now, the hollow once a fairy circle,<br>
Long since fairy dream haunted.<br>
Look down from the sacred grove, now the square.<br>
Recall the one attendance as a child:<br>
Visions of darker, older nights since.<br>
<br>
Escape to the countryside;<br>
Great sunlight to dispel dark fairy rumour.<br>
Yet the pale blue sky but tissue, the thinnest canopy.<br>
Indigo lace swirling, grey clouds, fog billowing.<br>
Incessant winds to lift and shred the canopy<br>
Till starless void revealed&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x2026; darkness, and the chill wind rises up<br>
The cobblestone <i>ruelle</i> from the hollow.<br>
On this night of many nights as one,<br>
Dark purple clouds stripe a moon large and orange,<br>
Placed just above <i>le théâtre de la combe</i>.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
As far as describing my creative process I remember becoming fixated
upon a nighttime scene of a narrow, winding, cobblestone,
other-century street and a small theatre therein. And the rest simply
came from the underground river of <i>thought rumour</i> below my direct
consciousness. Further, I might add a section of my novel <i>Emily of
Wolkeld</i>. Here is Emily describing her special place
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
She gazed once more at the broken outline of Wolkeld Hall through the
trees, letting her concentration slip and her eyes glaze. She
listened after that strange place in her mind from which bits
and pieces of scenes played beyond her comprehension, where
shadows of thoughts never quite became clear. Though at times
something would suddenly stand before her and demand her best
attempt at a poetisation.
</p>

<p>
Since Kansas, since puberty, she would occasionally find herself
slipping into some further space beyond the secret compartments. But
again, she could only sense, partially comprehend this expansive,
twilit region, fleeting, but long dominating her heart and mind. At
first she considered such flights just intense day-dreaming, but over
time they became less imagined, more a definite communion with a
distinctly separate realm. It was a dusky world, steeped in sublime
melancholic loneliness, often large and panoramic. At first she found
it worrisome&#x2014;not some clear religious transport of light and
ecstasy. And yet she came to believe good was speaking, not evil, nor
for that matter any sort of lurking mental illness. She wished it to
be something of her soul’s true home, perhaps some distant view of
Cumbria—at least that was the place to which she always mapped it, for
which she yearned immediately thereafter.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The queen of this sort of <i>Schizophrenia Lite™</i> is of course Emily
Dickinson, whose lines often disappear into this underground
region. Reading her hundreds of little one-, two-, three-stanza bursts
leaves me certain she was prototypically Schizo-lite™
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
A thought went up my mind to-day<br>
That I have had before,<br>
But did not finish, &#x2014; some way back,<br>
I could not fix the year,<br>
<br>
Nor where it went, nor why it came<br>
The second time to me,<br>
Nor definitely what it was,<br>
Have I the art to say.<br>
<br>
But somewhere in my soul, I know<br>
I&rsquo;ve met the thing before;<br>
It just reminded me &#x2014; &rsquo;t was all &#x2014;<br>
And came my way no more.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Bright gems, one after the other, poured out of that terribly gentle,
unimaginably deep woman.
</p>

<p>
Now, on to what I consider Poe&rsquo;s best poem, namely, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabel_Lee">Annabel Lee</a></i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
It was many and many a year ago,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;By the name of Annabel Lee;<br>
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Than to love and be loved by me.<br>
<br>
I was a child and she was a child,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
But we loved with a love that was more than love&#x2014;<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I and my Annabel Lee&#x2014;<br>
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Coveted her and me.<br>
<br>
And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
So that her highborn kinsmen came<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;And bore her away from me,<br>
To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea.<br>
<br>
The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Went envying her and me—<br>
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.<br>
<br>
But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of those who were older than we&#x2014;<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of many far wiser than we&#x2014;<br>
And neither the angels in Heaven above<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Nor the demons down under the sea<br>
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
<br>
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In her sepulchre there by the sea&#x2014;<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In her tomb by the sounding sea.<br>

If there is a better American example of the Dark Muse, I don&rsquo;t know
it. Here Poe is sustainable contemplative melancholic, rather than
hurling his fright bombs as in his prose. Did Poe know of Novalis and
his supposed hundred nights of graveside vigilance for deceased Sophie
von Kühn? Perhaps but totally irrelevant. Again, I suss out
that both Poe and Emily Brontë got the Dark Muse and gave it with
their poetry, but not in their prose, falling back into gothic. And so
I fall back to poetry and fragmented bursts as the only vehicle of
true Dark.

spewing pure calumny, making up whole-cloth fabrications are the long

very fate has recently befallen my Bach and Mozart of poetry, Emily
Brontë and Emily Dickinson. But first, allow me to deal with a
particularly annoying critical review of <i>Jane Eyre</i> by the

transgender proclivities to the level of enlightenment, the bearers&rsquo;

<p>
In the photo to the right I ask, do we see a long-suffering,
compassionate person; or is this a cold, haughty, insufferable
urbanite exuding emotional detachment and unavailability? Hard to say
from just a picture. In any event, she was a late-Victorian,
early-Edwardian intellectual and writer, a founding member of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomsbury_Group">Bloomsbury Group</a> of like-minded intellectuals and artists. And it was
in 1916 in her collected essays called <i>The Common Reader</i> that she
critiqued <i>Jane Eyre</i>, as well as <i>Wuthering Heights</i> along with their
two authors Charlotte and Emily Brontë. And as I posit, in so doing
she could not have aligned herself more strongly with the &ldquo;don&rsquo;t get
it&rdquo; crowd.
</p>

<p>
Woolf is openly patronising and condescending of Charlotte
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
When we think of her [Charlotte Brontë] we have to imagine some one
who had no lot in our modern world; we have to cast our minds back to
the ’fifties of the last century, to a remote parsonage upon the wild
Yorkshire moors. In that parsonage, and on those moors, unhappy and
lonely, in her poverty and her exaltation, she remains for ever.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
No &ldquo;lot&rdquo; in the modern world? This <i>qualifies</i> not disqualifies
Charlotte to tell me a story. It is having no &ldquo;lot&rdquo; in a natural,
organic world from which Woolf suffered. Then
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
She [Charlotte Brontë] does not attempt to solve the problems of human
life; she is even unaware that such problems exist; all her force, and
it is the more tremendous for being constricted, goes into the
assertion, &ldquo;I love,&rdquo; &ldquo;I hate,&rdquo; &ldquo;I suffer.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Outrageous! And what problems of human life have ever been solved by
anyone living in a modern city? Cities, Ms Woolf, <i>are the problem</i>,
and any attempt at solving anything in a city is never more than the
momentary calming of a tempest in a teapot. Here she really gets to it
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In other words, we read Charlotte Brontë not for exquisite observation
of character&#x2014;her characters are vigorous and elementary; not for
comedy&#x2014;hers is grim and crude; not for a philosophic view of
life&#x2014;hers is that of a country parson&rsquo;s daughter; but for her
poetry. Probably that is so with all writers who have, as she has, an
overpowering personality, so that, as we say in real life, they have
only to open the door to make themselves felt. There is in them some
untamed ferocity perpetually at war with the accepted order of things
which makes them desire to create instantly rather than to observe
patiently. This very ardour, rejecting half shades and other minor
impediments, wings its way past the daily conduct of ordinary people
and allies itself with their more inarticulate passions. It makes them
poets, or, if they choose to write in prose, intolerant of its
restrictions. Hence it is that both Emily and Charlotte are always
invoking the help of nature. They both feel the need of some more
powerful symbol of the vast and slumbering passions in human nature
than words or actions can convey. It is with a description of a storm
that Charlotte ends her finest novel <i>Villette</i>. &ldquo;The skies hang full
and dark&#x2014;a wrack sails from the west; the clouds cast themselves
into strange forms.&rdquo; So she calls in nature to describe a state of
mind which could not otherwise be expressed. But neither of the
sisters observed nature accurately as Dorothy Wordsworth observed it,
or painted it minutely as Tennyson painted it. They seized those
aspects of the earth which were most akin to what they themselves felt
or imputed to their characters, and so their storms, their moors,
their lovely spaces of summer weather are not ornaments applied to
decorate a dull page or display the writer&rsquo;s powers of
observation&#x2014;they carry on the emotion and light up the meaning of
the book.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I&rsquo;m not sure how a person could be more clueless, more mistaken. Woolf
and her Bloomsbury friends were certainly anti-Romanticism&#x2014;as were
all the cool kids by that time; but in this passage her ignorance,
intolerance, and general cluelessness truly flashes brightly. First,
saying Charlotte&rsquo;s prose is poetic is not a failing as she seems to
mean, rather, great achievement. Then to say Charlotte has an
overpowering personality leading her to impatiently throw out
half-baked observations is ludicrous. <i>Jane Eyre</i> is all about the
main protagonist weaving in and out of the &ldquo;accepted order of things,&rdquo;
carving out a place for herself against great impediments. But then
the centrepiece of Woolf lunacy, namely, the accusation that
Charlotte and Emily are always &ldquo;invoking the help of nature.&rdquo; Aaaagh!
Virginia, dear, <i>that&rsquo;s a feature not a bug!</i>
</p>

<p>
Woolf is critical of Brontëan use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathetic_fallacy">pathetic fallacy</a>,<label id='fnr.133' for='fnr-in.133.3390786' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>133</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.133.3390786' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>133</sup>
<b>Pathetic</b> from Middle French <i>pathetique</i> &ldquo;provoking emotion,&rdquo;
borrowed from Late Latin <i>pathēticus</i> &ldquo;affecting the emotions,&rdquo; borrowed
from Greek <i>pathētikós</i> "capable of feeling, emotional, receptive,
passive, i.e., not pathetic as we today use it to mean sad and
contemptible.
</span> a
staple of Romantic Era writing. But of course writers of Woolf&rsquo;s era
were through with the link between Nature and man. They were onto more
realistic depictions of life. And yet all I see from them and their
ilk is creating snob appeal around existential meaninglessness,
hopelessness, absurdism.
</p>

<p>
No, indeed, Woolf can&rsquo;t abide the Brontëan use of Nature. Charlotte
has apparently blundered by &ldquo;call[ing] in nature to describe a state
of mind which could not otherwise be expressed.&rdquo; What other vehicle of
expression should there be? Woolf makes the ridiculous criticism of
saying storms, moors, lovely spaces of summer weather should only be
&ldquo;ornaments applied to decorate a dull page or display the writer’s
powers of observation.&rdquo; She says the use of Nature to &ldquo;carry on the
emotion and light up the meaning of the book&rdquo; is bad writing. She
claims William Wordsworth sister Dorothy was a more accurate observer
of nature. Really? Dorothy Wordsworth was through-and-through a
nature-based Romanticist. Although mainly unpublished, she was a poet
in lockstep with her brother. My takeaway is the more shade, the more
attempts at discrediting the Brontës Woolf made, the more obvious who
the wiser was.
</p>

<p>
Allow me something I found literally by just opening <i>Emily Brontë The
Complete Poems</i> to a random page
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
O evening, why is thy light so sad?<br>
Why is the sun&rsquo;s last ray so cold?<br>
Hush! our smile is as ever glad,<br>
But my heart is growing old.<br>
<br>
It&rsquo;s over now; I&rsquo;ve known it all;<br>
I&rsquo;ll hide it in my heart no more,<br>
But back again that night recall,<br>
And think the fearful vision o&rsquo;er.<br>
<br>
The evening sun in cloudless shine<br>
Has passed from summer&rsquo;s heaven divine,<br>
And dark the shades of twilight grew,<br>
And stars were in the depth of blue<br>
<br>
And in the heath or mountain far<br>
From human eye and human care,<br>
With thoughtful thought and tearful eye,<br>
I sadly watched that solemn sky.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
The narrator&rsquo;s emotions float upon, are embedded in Nature. A real
human being has exactly this sort of experience: Life and Nature are
interwoven. Simply put, the Brontës were beholden unto Nature and
God. They beseeched Nature and God,<label id='fnr.134' for='fnr-in.134.8329943' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>134</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.134.8329943' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>134</sup>
<i>Deus sive Natura</i>, the slogan of Baruch Spinoza&rsquo;s pantheism:
the view that god and nature are interchangeable, or that there is no
distinction between the creator and the creation.
</span> and thus came back with
blessings in the form of lines such as these. And so I cannot allow
Woolf, nor any other city-bound modernist clone-bunnies, to cancel my
ladies&rsquo; artistic licenses. Modern realists like Woolf are
self-condemned to a mental and emotional poverty for refusing the
miraculousness&#x2014;however sublime or terrible&#x2014;of Nature and our
fantastic membership thereof. Ironic how so-called urban realists are
nearly all &ldquo;reformists&rdquo; out to radical socialists, always wanting to
improve mankind&rsquo;s lot, many following deterministic Marxist dialectic
scripts.<label id='fnr.135' for='fnr-in.135.127195' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>135</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.135.127195' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>135</sup>
Perhaps see <a href="https://youtu.be/6TK9c-caEcw?si=VfMnEZFDX9QXrIPX">Bertrand Russell on his meeting with Vladimir

</span> And yet they cannot see how <i>no one knows what to do
with this Industrial Era!</i>&#x2014;not the absentee capitalists, not the
socialists. Nor does anyone know how the human is supposed to ever
thrive in these alien, hostile, sterile urban hell zones&#x2014;however

<h4 id="org75a6fe5">Modern attack on the Amherst and Haworth Emilies</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org75a6fe5">
<p>
If Virginia Woolf was wrong out to downright silly, she was just a
beginner at literary defamation. The travesties I mean are the
modernist triumphalist revisionist, intentionally anachronistic
misrepresentations of my two main principals, i.e., the two Emilies,
Brontë and Dickinson, specifically in the form of the AppleTV+ series
<i>Dickinson</i> (2019) and the Hollywood film <i>Emily</i> (2022). It is partly
the need to correct these serious crimes against culture and history
that I have initiated this whole WutheringUK effort.
</p>

<p>
Both <i>Dickinson</i> and <i>Emily</i> are completely cringe unwatchable, but
worse by far is the all but demonic mutilation of Emily Dickinson
unfolding in the three-season, thirty episode AppleTV+ series
<i>Dickinson</i>. Apparently, the real Amherst Emily said something
affectionate in a letter to a female friend&#x2014;which opened the door
for screenwriter Alena Smith to flip typical nineteenth-century
platonic<label id='fnr.137' for='fnr-in.137.5594510' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>137</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.137.5594510' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>137</sup>
Platonic as opposed to romantic-sexual love was seen in the
past as a higher, deeper, quasi-sacred form of love, i.e., the love
going on in heaven between the saints and angels brought down to
Earth. Today, however, we are made to understand by the modernist
Freudians that the human can only ever be a crazed sex monkey, thus,
any other view is delusional puerile. Desensitisation then becomes the
only answer to &ldquo;sexual hangups.&rdquo;
</span> to sexual and reinvent the shy, gentle, reclusive,
homebody, proto-nerd-girl Emily Elizabeth as a brassy, bratty,
boorish, snarky, completely desensitised and masculinised,
outta-control, hyper-sexual protest-lesbian champion against the
patriarchy. And so this period porn, this cultural hooliganism went on
for three years, spread over thirty episodes of crashing, crypto-rebel
poser effrontery, even winning a Peabody, among other, &ldquo;awards.&rdquo; As
the wincing Wikipedia article which categorises it as a
&ldquo;comic-drama&rdquo; says
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Dickinson</i> is notable for its use of anachronisms, incorporating
modern language, music, and references into its portrayal of
historical events and figures.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#x2026;quite possibly the understatement of all time. It also states
<i>Dickinson</i> is &ldquo;a window into the cultural and political climate of
the time.&rdquo;  Really? Quite a dirty, distorting window. It is nothing of
the sort, rather, an entire reinvention based on radical, male-hating,
misanthropic, twenty-first-century agitprop feminism, full
stop. Again, if conspiracy theories about Cultural Marxism were ever
to be taken serious, this would be Exhibit A.<label id='fnr.138' for='fnr-in.138.7127346' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>138</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.138.7127346' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>138</sup>

<a href="https://youtu.be/pFp05alGLow?si=tTk-5CPhmpdkeQ3R">this music video</a> by the actress portraying Emily Dickinson is
attached to the series as its supposed theme song. Alas&#x2026;

less than a frontal assault on an icon of Western culture, and I don&rsquo;t
like it.

<p>
I hemmed and hawed over this bit of electron savagery, but seriously,
there can be <i>zero</i> buy-in to this sort of nonsense if we are to get
anywhere near understanding the true nature of these special
people. To get, to grok my principals we must suspend any and all
revisionist nonsense. We can&rsquo;t just have actors donning excellent
period costumes&#x2014;only to carry on like today&rsquo;s vapid, degenerate
urban hipsters. We have to accept, work with the world they inhabited,
warts and all. <i>They&rsquo;re not our pets.</i> And even if we could go back in
time and meet our chosen unicorns, we would probably not become their
friends. In my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> my modern Emily is playing the
tourist in today&rsquo;s tourist-trap Haworth and imagines an encounter with
classic Emily
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
She wondered anew what Emily Brontë would have thought had she walked by at that moment. Modern Emily would have stared beseechingly at original Emily&#x2014;and no doubt original Emily would have been duly affronted.<br>
<br>
“Miss, are you going out to the falls this day? May I come along? I do not wish to be alone in the countryside,” modern Emily might call after her hero.<br>
<br>
And fitting the heaviness of the air, the blankness of the thinly clouded, washed-out blue sky above, classic Emily would flatly reply, “Yes, I am going there, but I can suffer no strange company. Good day.”<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Right. I can imagine Haworth Emily of yore as being quite curt,
abrupt, protective of her privacy, in short, anti-social. Again,
making a personality cult out of our heroes from the past, however
sensational as we may now see them, is a big mistake.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, hacks, polemicists are forever appropriating some defenceless
figure from the past to reimagine as their pets. And so any gifted
unicorn from yesteryear who might have chafed even the least bit at
society&rsquo;s eternal(ly shifting, reforming) containment fields is
reintroduced reconstituted as some proto-revolutionist. For
shame. Ghost rustling, I call this.

Of course the audio-visual medium of film is fraught. First and
foremost, we must accept the social-political landscape of those
times. Christianity for one simply was a given in both of their
lives. It was their metaphysical foundation and was largely accepted
by both Emilies, indeed, as I&rsquo;ve said, so often poetised.

One of my earliest encounters with the magic of Dostoevski&rsquo;s <i>presence
of eternal harmony</i> came on a dark Halloween evening back when I was a
little boy in a small Southern Illinois town. We were
trick-or-treating on my street, the oldest in town with its
Victorians, cobblestone, gas streetlights, and at some point I knew I
had entered another world, another time. Being so young meant I was
not completely disabused of magic, thus, other worlds, other
dimensions didn&rsquo;t seem too out of the ordinary. I remember looking up
into the dense, bare branches of the trees to see the moon looking out
of crossing clouds and feeling like I was a part of some magical
legendspace.<label id='fnr.141' for='fnr-in.141.650631' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>141</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.141.650631' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>141</sup>
More about <i>legendspace</i> as we go along.
</span> Throughout my life I&rsquo;ve compared subsequent POEH
experiences with that Halloween night. Perhaps this is why I cleave to
the Dark Muse.
</p>

<p>
I now live in the far northeastern tip of Minnesota on the so-called
North Shore of Lake Superior, in the very last county, Cook, just
before the Canadian border. This is the main part of the so-called
&ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region">Arrowhead Region</a>&rdquo; continuing north and east of Duluth, some six
million-plus acres of wilderness on the shores of the world&rsquo;s largest
body (by surface area) of freshwater. To my mind, this is a very Dark
Muse kind of place, so much so that I cannot go, cannot go&#x2014;as much
as my fellow humans here distress me with their pointedly anti-Dark
attitudes. Pictures may be worth thousands of words, but our Dark vibe
must be experienced to be truly appreciated. I still get tiny glimpses
of the shadow and magic realm whenever I look out at my moonlit
<i>Inland Sea</i> over the treetops of dark spruce and gnarled, bare
aspen. Once again, Nature is the foundation of Dark.

Really though, calling it <i>Lake</i> Superior is
like calling Einstein a high school graduate.
</span> or <i>Mother Superior</i>, as some call her, is so
much more sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is much
smaller and much&#x2014;simpler. The enormity of our Inland Sea means she
is often violent like any sea or ocean of saltwater. No friendly
little puddle for beer-and-brats picnickers, speedboat and jet ski
riffraff is she.<label id='fnr.143' for='fnr-in.143.3255871' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>143</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.143.3255871' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>143</sup>
Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her longer than
ten minutes can lead to hypothermia &#x2026; at least on the North
Coast. Although the south beaches of Wisconsin and Michigan can be
swimmable in the height of summer.

her shores, often dark and moody, if not angry and malevolent on a
stormy night.

Despite our huge and all but contiguous wildness, the Arrowhead is not
<i>spectacular</i> in the usual American Great Outdoors sense. Nothing here
overwhelms as with the American West and Alaska with their &ldquo;natural
wonders&rdquo; postcard vistas galore. As I&rsquo;m saying, a deep moodiness often
prevails, offering the subtle to sublime pathway. Sadly, however, my
local community is bereft of Dark Musers. Which might have a silver

Muse is nature or nurture. If I see no past-centuries

<br>
</span> if I have no like-minded community to mutually
re-enforce nighttime proclivities, then any Dark musing must come from
the actual place itself, hence, nature over nurture.
</p>

<p>
But I am quite alone here with my Dark musings. Despite Grand Marais
counting only some thirteen hundred souls, we are becoming evermore
urban/suburban-like in behavior and mentality. Why? Mainly due to our
popularity as a Northern Midwest resort town. Tourists, short-,
medium-, and long-stay, well-off retirees, and especially relocating
urban-suburban refugees constantly dilute the scene. And these
newcomers are increasingly not adapting to small-town life; instead,
maintaining their aloof, disengaged, emotionally unavailable,
blinkered urban-suburban ways. Of course &ldquo;boosters,&rdquo; the knee-jerk
positive promoters and spin doctors, will always disagree with this
assessment, but many &ldquo;old-timers&rdquo; agree that it ain&rsquo;t what it used to
be. Alas.
</p>

<p>
A particular North Shore social-psychology phenomenon is the large
numbers of people who relocate here from the Midwestern urban
city-states, e.g., Chicago or especially the Twin Cities, ostensibly
to <i>reinvent</i> themselves. Of course tourist destinations trade in
image and fantasy, but here is a very unique sort of expectancy. My
theory has it that our newcomers have made the leap out of their
sterile, soulless clone-bunny urban/suburban to be some better, more
<i>authentic</i> version of themselves in the wilderness. The most dominant
North Shore reinvention <i>lifestyle</i> is based around Hemingway and Jack
London, i.e., a macho, gonzo, adventure attitude about the Great
Outdoors, something I call <i>Neo-Klondikism</i>. Of course the real white
European North Shore pioneers of the late nineteenth, early twentieth
centuries were mainly of Scandinavian origins and brought their
admixture of Scandi and Victorian civilization to the wilderness. But
little if any of that remains. Now we see <i>Outside</i> magazine acteurs,
college-grad back-to-the-lander nouveau hillbilly peasant chic,
tattoos, huge beards, Carhartt clothing, Jeep Cherokees, the theme
music faux country-western Appalachian&#x2014;in other words an impromptu
guerrilla theatre of American Zeitgeist phantom imagery. But then what
are they supposed to be doing?
</p>

<p>
Though I cannot say outright nobody &ldquo;gets&rdquo; this place. There is a
tacit understanding that here is not dazzling striking amazing. An
advertisement poster for Arrowhead tourism showed a twilit Boundary
Waters wilderness lake with the tagline &ldquo;Stirred not shaken.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure
many do have Dark Muse moments, but simply lack the cultural
background to handle it. For example our so-called Northern Lights are
beloved, thus, Night gets a probational capitalisation

<p>
Here&rsquo;s a few lines I once wrote some twenty years ago after a
late-autumn hike
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Mists race westward through the surrounding spruce forest, the entire
ridge enveloping. The light is quickly failing, the Western
Hemisphere’s greatest inland sea just four miles south and seven
hundred feet below fully obscured. Sleet begins to fall stinging my
face disallowing my eyes to fully focus. Though I hear the wind
through the coated trees, the distant sound of the invisible waves
crashing angrily against the rocks, land&rsquo;s staunch defenders.
</p>

<p>
I have come the four miles up from the town, up the wet, slippery
trail, up through the darkening forest, to pay homage to this late
autumn wonderland. I, modern, wear a Gore-tex jacket over a Merino
wool top over a silk base layer. I wear running tights and padded
biking gloves. I wear special minimalist running shoes to simulate
barefoot running. So dressed I am out to face the age-old elements.
</p>

<p>
Not a soul as I climb the trail. I pause at the ridge’s two main
streams to witness their loud and clear coursing from all the new
precipitation. I should walk rather than run. But visibility is going
fast and I must reach the ridge-top ere dusk.
</p>

<p>
Fittingly anti-climatic is my arrival at the cloud-bound ridge
top. All but dark when I set off again for home. The snow is now
accumulating in earnest, making downhill footing difficult. But the
Muse is strong, and the growing darkness makes it all the stronger.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
That was written before I really had latched onto the Dark Muse. Now
things are much more firmly formed and I&rsquo;m following a more
intentional path vis-à-vis Dark&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
When did magical become Dark magical? Everyone of my generation knows
the television shows <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family">The Addams Family</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Munsters">The Munsters</a></i> &#x2026; as
well as various gothic and horror films. Odd as those shows were, we
all seemed to &ldquo;get&rdquo; the premise and laugh along with the basic goths
versus normies gag. Likewise, the biggest film of my childhood, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz">The
Wizard of Oz</a></i> had many dark themes, especially the Wicked Witch of the
West and her very creepy flying monkeys and castle.<label id='fnr.145' for='fnr-in.145.5642681' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>145</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.145.5642681' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>145</sup>

</p>

<p>
My teen years were fairly &ldquo;normal,&rdquo; the only Dark exposure coming from
my paternal grandmother, who channelled a very Victorian Englishness,
inherited as we understood from her model Victorian mother. She
embodied a proto-Downton Abbey aura, something no one in that small
Southern Illinois small town could fathom&#x2014;until finally seeing
Maggie Smith&rsquo;s Violet Crawley, The Dowager Countess of Grantham!

<p>
My Grandma Grace Virginia was no a rangy intellectual, but she was a
potent carrier of the Victorian mega-meme and exposed me to its poets,
especially Poe. She could recite <i>Annabel Lee</i> by heart. I say she was
not an educated thinker; nevertheless, she possessed an instinctual
grasp of the Dark Muse as though it was a common thread of hers and
earlier generations. Longfellow and Whittier were also favourites, and
I can only assume she had been infected by her mother who was born
circa 1870. To be sure, we are woven from strands reaching back into
the past.
</p>

<p>
In 1975 at age nineteen I was sent to West Germany by the
U.S. Army. My first assignment was far out on the Bohemian frontier
deep in the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Forest">Bavarian Forest</a></i> where the U.S. Army and Air Force ran a
small mountaintop electronic eavesdropping post near the tiny village
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimbach,_Upper_Palatinate">Rimbach</a>.<label id='fnr.146' for='fnr-in.146.1334109' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>146</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.146.1334109' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>146</sup>

<img src="images/lichteneck_ap2.jpg" alt="lichteneck_ap2.jpg"> <br>
<br>
</span> We were less than one hundred Americans &ldquo;on the
economy,&rdquo; which meant we had no base or barracks and lived amongst the
locals. My rooms were with a farmer family in a house just below a
<i>haunted</i> castle ruins overlooking the wild, forested main ridge.
</p>

<p>
For the first time in my life I was seeing, not just hearing about the
Old World. I&rsquo;ll never forget waking up that first September morning in
the small country-style <i>Pension</i> the Army had rented for
transients. It was located in the centre of the village and overlooked
the inner courtyard of a farm where I saw a wizened old crone from a
fairytale splitting firewood. I looked up to the facing hillside and
saw a small troop of men wearing what looked like other-century
traditional costumes hand-scything hay and piling it into a
horse-drawn wagon. 
</p>

<p>
As the fall turned into winter I spent every free moment hiking the
forest mountain trails. It was as if time had changed mechanisms from
round, perfect cogs to virtual Möbius strips. I would work a shift at
the American site on Rimbach&rsquo;s &ldquo;backyard mountain,&rdquo; the <i>Hoherbogen</i>,
then reenter the land time had forgot. There was no denying Nature
there had a very dark, old, serious feel to it, while by comparison my
Tennessee Smoky Mountains had a lighter, even merry feel. I almost
made it a daily pilgrimage to the ruins, parts of which had been
reconstructed, featuring the original keep.<label id='fnr.147' for='fnr-in.147.6509637' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>147</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.147.6509637' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>147</sup>
Castle ruins Lichtenegg near Rimbach, Lower Bavaria. <br>
<img src="images/LichteneggInMist.png" alt="LichteneggInMist.png"> <br>
<br>
</span> A legend said a
princess had thrown herself from the original keep to her death, and
her ghost supposedly roamed the place after dark. Thus the warning to
never be in the woods after dark was taken seriously. This and many
ghost stories were taken serious by the locals, who seemed out of
another era to be sure. I can remember very many dark, gothic moments
in that place, as well as other chance moments during my Army
times. But I was not keying on Dark; it was all simply
experiential. Like a subsequent posting to the north in a small Lower
Saxony town. There my digs were in a centuries-old half-timbered
house.
</p>

<p>
For the first time I wasn&rsquo;t plugged into the social-psychology feed of
American media. Everything around me felt old, very old, the Bavarians
connected to something else, perhaps a fairytale that was now in
suspended animation such as the . And when I was handed a copy of <i>Lord of
the Rings</i> and I first learned of Hobbits and the Shire, yes, this was
the Shire.

<h4 id="org8dfee0a">My Christianity</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8dfee0a">
<p>
A few things have led me back to belief in God. Besides the Brontës
and the other poets of the Glorious Nineteenth showing me how wondrous
belief can be when its subtleties are brought out through poetising, I
have a more mundane, topical reason, namely, hallucinogenic drugs. I
mean to say I finally realised that any &ldquo;mind-altering&rdquo; chemicals are
a false commandeering of my natural sense of amazement and wonderment,
that a human&rsquo;s innate sense of awe and wonderment must be carefully
maintained and protected, that this highly sought-after presence of
eternal harmony state can never be summoned artificially. I also
realised that simply chasing after POEH moments in general is a bad
practice. Which is why I reject Eastern religions&#x2014;as I spoke of
above. Again, Buddhism, whether legend-influenced Tibetan or
legend-free Zen, wants us in a permanent POEH, which to my thinking is
an artificial, again, <i>trans</i>-humanist state. I repeat, my Haworth
Emily as a lean, hungry, deprived, hard-pressed little bat is my
truth. She who brought nature paganism and the Dark Muse and
anti-woo-woo Protestantism close enough together to smell each other
per Keats&rsquo; <i>Negative Capability</i>.
</p>

<p>
Christianity as a holding pattern on earth, an intentional backing
away from any sustained POEH state indeed. And I must admit Nature has
time and again told me not to bring any sort of fantasy or stoner
mentality to Her, i.e., expectations (read demands) of heightened,
magical, &ldquo;cosmic&rdquo; happenings all for traipsing along a wilderness
trail for a few hours. She has seriously reprimanded me for expecting
some cheap, cliche nonsense like that.
</p>

<p>
I might call my Christianity a &ldquo;responsive&rdquo; Christianity in that I
read, e.g., Christina Rossetti&rsquo;s <i>Love is strong as death</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I have not sought Thee, I have not found Thee,<br>
I have not thirsted for Thee:<br>
And now cold billows of death surround me,<br>
Buffeting billows of death astound me, &#x2014;<br>
Wilt Thou look upon, wilt Thou see<br>
Thy perishing me?&ldquo;<br>
<br>
&rdquo;Yea, I have sought thee, yea, I have found thee,<br>
Yea, I have thirsted for thee,<br>
Yea, long ago with love&rsquo;s bands I bound thee:<br>
Now the Everlasting Arms surround thee, &#x2014;<br>
Through death&rsquo;s darkness I look and see<br>
And clasp thee to Me."<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
and I feel, I respond. I find Rossetti on the same fatalist wavelength
as Emily Brontë. She is describing an interaction with God not
dissimilar to Haworth Emily&rsquo;s <i>"I&rsquo;ll come when thou art saddest</i>
where, again, life is bitterly entropic, i.e., effort is nowhere near
linearly rewarded, plans hardly realised.<label id='fnr.148' for='fnr-in.148.9222949' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>148</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.148.9222949' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>148</sup>
And of course the joke, Want to make God laugh? Tell Him your
plans. Or the German, <i>Der Mensch denkt, der Gott lenkt</i> or, The human
thinks, God steers.
</span> 
</p>

<p>
But then organised Christianity is dogma&#x2014;with results, rewards for
our compliance and obedience thin on the ground other than avoidance
of instant damnation upon death.
