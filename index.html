The purpose of this media effort will be to convey some of my thoughts
and impressions about all things dark, or what I call the <i>Dark
Muse</i>. Here is an example, a test of sorts from Emily Brontë <label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.319506' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.319506' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>

Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br>
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br>
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br>
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br>

Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>

Unfortunately, many associate dark with depression, morbidity, if not
evil. This is certainly not my take on dark, rather, dark from a
purely aesthetic perspective. Here is another great example of &ldquo;you
either get dark or you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; this time from Emily Dickinson&rsquo;s <label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.9042507' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.9042507' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>

<i>There&rsquo;s a certain slant of light</i>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
There&rsquo;s a certain Slant of light,<br>
Winter Afternoons –<br>
That oppresses, like the Heft<br>
Of Cathedral Tunes –<br>
<br>
Heavenly Hurt, it gives us –<br>
We can find no scar,<br>
But internal difference –<br>
Where the Meanings, are –<br>
<br>
None may teach it – Any –<br>
&rsquo;Tis the seal Despair –<br>
An imperial affliction<br>
Sent us of the Air –<br>

When it comes, the Landscape listens –<br>
Shadows – hold their breath –<br>
When it goes, &rsquo;tis like the Distance<br>
On the look of Death –<br>

➝ The increasingly extra-natural human
</p>

<p>
It is my contention that we understand nature differently than
early-nineteenth-century poets such as the Haworth and Amherst
Emilies <label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.349804' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.349804' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
My shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson are based on
their towns of origin &#x2014; Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the former and
Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.
</span> and their contemporaries might have. Today, we spend
nearly all our lives in structures, buildings, and dwellings so much
more sealed off than dwelling in the early eighteen-hundreds as to be
comparable to spaceships or sealed structures on atmosphere-free alien
planets. The Haworth parsonage where the Brontës lived had more in
common structurally with human shelters from thousands of years ago
than with ours only two hundred years later. This has created a very
steep gradient between indoors and outdoors. Which in turn has brought
us to understand nature as a <i>place</i> extra our high-tech modern
homes. Which leads us to rate nature wildest and most natural farthest
from our greatly unnatural collections of sealed-off structures.
</p>

<p>
But what if nature were not a place, rather, the myriad of cycles of
birth, growth, deterioration, and death going on all around and
everywhere, entirely without any concept of in- or outdoors?
To be sure, the Brontës would have know this more aboriginal meaning
of nature as countless processes in concert than a place outside of
inside.
</p>

<p>
Hence, death is a part of nature, not just a negative outcome after a
failed attempt at negotiating a modern health care labyrinth. For
other creatures death is either old age, or
</p>

<p>
Down through the centuries more and more of humanity has come into the
<i>Great Indoors.</i> In the West, architecture reached an aesthetic
crescendo in the nineteenth century just as cities became
exponentially larger and increasingly &ldquo;indoorsy&rdquo; than just a century
before.
</p>

<p>
Today nature is something entirely outdoors, e.g., the <i>Great
Outdoors</i>. 
</p>


<p>
After writing on my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> for the past seven years
I have made a rather bitter discovery, namely, that mankind is largely
wandering about clueless &#x2014; <i>seriously</i> clueless.
</p>

<p>
One key turning point was to finally understand what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Keats">John Keats</a> meant
in his <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_capability">Negative Capability</a></i> letter to his brother. In it he describes
what he means by Negative Capability, the ability to not rush to
philosophical conclusion, rather, to let a sort of cognitive
dissonance run its course. But then Keats also condemns Samuel
Coleridge&rsquo;s obsession with philosophical truth, repudiating his
<i>Biographia Litararia</i>, which was Coleridge&rsquo;s attempt to, among other
things, bring the bulk of German Romanticism to a British audience.
