Today is trying to be sunny. But yesterday was a very blustery,
wuthering day, the 14th. A day for which this site is named. A day
that closes in on the senses and the mind and makes me feel like there
is no other place than here on the Inland Sea, that all other places
have ceased to exist. I suppose we&rsquo;re possessive of one another, I and
she, the Inland Sea and her shoulder, the North Coast. But I cannot
assume anything more than complete imperious indifference on her
part. I must continually adore and prostrate myself to her, while her
indifference drives my obsession all the more.

</span>,&rdquo; she beckons, but in a mocking, almost sinister
tone&#x2014;erasing my memory of it so instantly, that I obey mindless of
the order. &ldquo;Come where?&rdquo; I occasionally bleat, woken from a dream or
trance, day or night.

This has been a typical North Coast (NC) April of weather confusion,
sun one day, clouds the next, rain, sleet, snow, every atmospheric
instability. Suffice it to say, here at least April she is not your
friend. Very low-ceiling misty-cloudy for a day, then open into the
huge heavens blue electric, then snow and cold wind. Wuthering.

Last week we saw melting and precipitation flood the Coop&rsquo;s and city&rsquo;s
parking lot partially. Looking up to the ridge, half was
cloud-shrouded, with the very highest parts frosted. Then the sun
blazed for a few days. Now snowflakes are confusingly going round
basically non-ascending.

<p>
The harbour is medium visibility, clouds hanging low. Sleet, snow
come-and-go. Winds are big north-easterly ripping across the sea.

so it escapes the scientific scalpels and tweezers
of scholarly research. Basically, one reads&#x2026;and one
absorbs&#x2014;perhaps many times this cycle. And then the exercise part of
the process is over. No further left-brain analysis or dissection
necessary. No &ldquo;what does it really mean?&rdquo; No &ldquo;what was the context in
which&#x2026;&rdquo; No &ldquo;what were his sources of inspiration.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s take a look
at a poem from whom I consider one of the leading poets of the age,
she being Emily Jane Brontë, specifically, her <i>Fall leaves fall</i>
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br />
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br />
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br />
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br />
I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br />
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br />
I shall sing when night’s decay<br />
Ushers in a drearier day.<br />

</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is your first test. You either get it or you don&rsquo;t. No digging or
working out its meaning necessary.
