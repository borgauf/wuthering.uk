<p>
<i>Just string together the good parts, a few from the odd corners of the
mundane world, a few from the ancestors, a few from cloudy old memories,
the rest from Faerie. . . .</i>
</p>

<p>
Althea Alice and Andrew Alexander Holcombe were sixteen-year-old twins
of above-average height and willowy build, with translucent pale skin,
fine brownish hair, noble faces, and intelligent hazel eyes with barely
noticeable brown central heterochromia iridum. Thea and Drew, as they
were called, lived in a large Victorian townhouse called Sattelsby House
in the tiny village of Maidenswell, along with their guardian, Miss
Janet “Nette” Ruttelsburger, and their amazing
great-great-great-great-aunt, Bernice Sattelsby, amazing firstly because
she was a ghost.
</p>

<p>
Thea and Drew were, for all intents and purposes, orphans. Their one
living parent, the airline pilot James “Jimbo” Holcombe, had left the
family six year previous. He was now based in Barcelona, Spain, with his
model-actress girlfriend Serena&#x2014;just Serena, no last name. He
supported his children financially, but rarely visited, and when he
did&#x2014;always with Serena&#x2014;things were invariably forced and awkward.
James Holcombe, thirty-nine years of age, was the very model of a
dashing airline captain. Unfortunately he had the mind of a teenage boy.
</p>

<p>
Far more tragic for the twins had been the death of their beloved
mother, Jocelyn Kate Sattlesby-Holcombe. It had been almost three years
since her mysterious death while cross-country skiing in the nearby
Leister Hills. The evidence strongly suggested she had been forced off a
cliff by a snowmobile. A local man was questioned; however, “fellow
citizens” vouched for his other whereabouts that afternoon. She had been
a beloved professor of English at nearby Saint Aginore College and was
sorely missed by Saint Aggie community.
</p>

<p>
The tiny hamlet of Maidenswell sat high up on the dun Silurian limestone
bluffs of the Leister River, just across from the much larger “full
service” town of Torndale. Maidenswell had been named for a spring-fed
pool bubbling out of a cleft of the high palisades. The original
settler&rsquo;s daughters had played in the grotto, often coming home wet and
muddy, making fretful mother and father angry, prompting them to invent
the ironic name.
</p>

<p>
It was just after the First Difficulties with Britain when the
hotel-slash-health spa was built around the springs, the waters having
gained fame as &ldquo;restorative,&rdquo; based on the testimony of experts of the
time. &ldquo;Send&rsquo;em up the ledge!&rdquo; became the spa&rsquo;s catchphrase. The Hotel
Leister was soon followed by a proper square of little shops and
boutiques, anchored by a five-hundred-seat theater, which hosted
concerts, operas, plays, lectures, and public debates. By the Civil
War, Maidenswell had become a popular resort spot and boasted
important residents and a constant stream of prominent visitors.
</p>

<p>
Although reaching Maidenswell had always been difficult. Not only was
the village high up on the sixty-foot river palisades, but surrounded
directly to the North by a ring of steep hills, the Cottbain Ridge,
usually referred to as the <i>Meniscus</i> due to its shape. To &ldquo;go up the
ledge&rdquo; during the horse-and-buggy age, one crossed the Leister River
from Torndale over the narrow, covered Leister Street Bridge, continued
on catalpa-tree-lined Leister Street through Leister Park, climbed up
the tight switchbacks, finally passing through the ornate wrought iron
Leister Gate. Steep, narrow, suitable for traffic no bigger than a
modest supply wagon, the brick paver lane served as the only way into
Maidenswell&#x2014;until a modern road was finally built by the WPA during
the Great Depression coming over the Meniscus from the northwest. As
lifting Leister Street up had been a considerable investment and feat of
engineering in the late eighteenth century, Maidenswell Road, or County
12, was no less an effort in the early nineteen-thirties as it wound,
climbed, and dipped its way southward over the Meniscus&rsquo; steep and
rugged terrain.
</p>

<p>
Finally Maidenswell had met the Automobile Age. Finally the village
could reconstitute, update itself. But no, there would not be a second
boom, as only a trickle of tourism came following World War II. Try as
they would, the boosters, the real estate brokers, the history buffs
could not revive the all but abandoned, mostly boarded up and
deteriorating ghost town. Probably the most ominous death knell was
the storied hotel closing for good in 1967. And so below the hulking
wooded hills, above the languid river, perched a once quaint village
slipping past the modern world and into forgottenness. Or so the
outside world thought&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Sattelsby House lay at the end of Sattelsby Row, the first street
inside Leister Gate, running eastward parallel the cliff edge and
perpendicular to Leister Street. The Row had been built in the
village&rsquo;s post-Civil War heyday by the children&rsquo;s
great-great-great-great-uncle, Colonel Franklin Sattelsby, in fact,
Aunt Bernice&rsquo;s husband. The townhouses, although not identical, were
complementary: all three-storied, all very neat and understated Second
Empire: facades of smooth, dark-red, proper facing brick,
trimmed modestly with the local limestone, sash windows long and
narrow, handsome slate-covered Mansard roofs from which dormer windows
protruded. Ornate Victorian wrought-iron fences separated the
properties from each other and from the brick sidewalk, the small
green space between house and lane once devoted to flower beds,
ornamental trees, small patches of lawn; however now mostly wilded
perennials, berry brambles, twisted, hops-strangled fruit and hardwood
trees. (Various rumors circulated as to whom had introduced the highly
aggressive hops vines to Maidenswell, the blame typically landing upon
the “swarthy German immigrants.) Sattelsby House was the farthest
eastern house of the row and, due to the angle, its southern wall
built flush against the high bluffs. Across of paver-brick Sattelsby
Row to the north were matching mews originally meant for the row&rsquo;s
horses and servants. The two-story mew directly across from Sattelsby
House was now used as a garage for the family&rsquo;s black 1957 Mercedes
W189 Saloon, the only working automobile in the village,
incidentally. Why the old Benz was the only working automobile will be
explained shortly.
</p>

<p>
As mentioned earlier, Mrs Bernice Agnes Sattelsby, née Graipes, truly
was a ghost and had been the original lady of the Sattelsby House. On
one sunny spring afternoon nearly one-hundred-and-fifty years ago, the
forty-one-year-old woman had fallen out of the second-story window of
the master bedroom, spun-bounced twice on the cliff face and landed in
the crown of an ancient hawthorn tree, most serious of her injuries a
broken neck. Her death had been ruled accidental as a bottle of
ammonia solution had been found on the sill, a cleaning rag still
smelling of ammonia clutched tightly in her hand. The servants
corroborated, saying the Missus had insisted on cleaning the outside
of the windows herself after finding unsatisfactory the recent efforts
of a window cleaning service from Torndale comprised of recent Irish
or German immigrants, the servants only able to agree they seemed,
sounded &ldquo;foreign.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Aunt Bernice was not an ephemeral or translucent spirit as one reads
about in books or perhaps has encountered on occasion, rather, a ghost
of uncommonly robust presence and visual integrity, which meant she
could appear (for those to whom she wished to appear) almost real and
life-like, albeit dressed in her original Victorian Era attire.
</p>

<p>
Aunt Bernice first appeared on the night of Jocelyn
Sattelsby-Holcombe&rsquo;s funeral in the front parlor after all the
mourners had left, which was roughly midnight. She calmly and
matter-of-factly introduced herself to Thea, Drew, and Nette,
announcing she would take over as the twins&rsquo; music, Latin,
and Greek tutor. Being a ghost, her slightly shimmering presence had a
certain cachet, her distant and echoey words gravitas, and, as a
result, no objections were raised. This was needed support, as Jimbo
and Serena had left immediately after the funeral service that
afternoon, not staying for the burial, having hardly spoken to anyone
the whole time other than the family lawyer, leaving poor
Nette&#x2014;until then Jocelyn&rsquo;s helper-slash-babysitter&#x2014;wondering how
to proceed, the children, of course, all the more stricken.
</p>

<p>
Nette Ruttelsburger, thirty-two, PhD, her dissertation in Early
Romantic German poetry, had taken a German instructor position at
Saint Aggie two years previous to Jocelyn&rsquo;s death. The instructor
position was not tenure track, and yet she abandoned her pursuit of a
professorship, not interested in interviewing for tenured positions at
schools in Saskatchewan, South Dakota, and Florida. Simply put, she
had never before in her life felt so at home as in the Leister Valley,
had so many good friends, nor such a caring mentor, soul mate, and
confidant as Jocelyn. As her position was only half-time, she helped
out with chores, errands, and babysitting at Sattelsby House. And
after Jocelyn&rsquo;s death, she gladly became the children&rsquo;s
guardian&#x2014;once absentee Jimbo finally had overcome his resentment and
suspicions of her. As with so many things concerning Maidenswell, the
strangest fate had brought her to and held her at Sattelsby House.
</p>

<p>
Nette was tall and thin,<label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.9790334' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.9790334' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
No hips or chest, as she would say.
</span> her expressive eyes toffee-brown, her
smooth, straight hair starkly varied dark and flaxen strands. No, she
would insist, she did not streak her hair; it was naturally that
way. She was darkly-inclined in philosophy and dress, distrustful the
modern parts of the modern world, and largely dismissive of
rationalism or naturalism, leaning towards mysticism. Indeed, her
attire was vaguely goth, but in recent years less &ldquo;industrial&rdquo; and
more nineteenth-century, largely due to Aunt Bernice&rsquo;s influence, as
well as less need to make a rebellious visual statement to the world
or the psychic ghosts of her troubled childhood back in Zanesville,
Ohio.
</p>

<p>
Nette did get on well with the ghosts, plural: with Aunt Bernice, as
well as with a young but long-deceased young man by the name of Henry
Lyman Whitherfield. Nette had met him one night at the Maidenswell
cemetery&#x2014;a cozy but lonely place as Henry would describe his &ldquo;portal.&rdquo;
Henry had been a &ldquo;theatre person&rdquo; in life, and in death was, as he
described himself, a &ldquo;concierge of the Beyond.&rdquo; He too was a ghost of
visual integrity and able to move all about Maidenswell environs&#x2014;in
addition to travelling to all sorts of Beyond&rsquo;s interesting places.
However, there was often conflict between Henry and Aunt Bernice. It was
his trips into Beyond that distressed the more mature Aunt Bernice, as
he was wont to bring back the queerest fish imaginable to an already
metaphysically-strained situation. In addition, Aunt Bernice did not
approve of his relationship with Nette, as they engaged in conjugal
intimacy in, as the senior woman described it, a metaphysically fraught
way. Nette, however, was not opposed to what amounted to leaving her
body to have Henry. In general, various mysterious complications had
arisen from Henry and Bernice&rsquo;s presence as substantial spirits in
Maidenswell, namely, that Maidenswell itself had become decidedly more
<i>insubstantial.</i>
</p>

<p>
Define <i>insubstantial.</i> Apparently, there existed a metaphysical inverse
relationship between, on the one hand, ghosts gaining persistence and
consequence in our world, and, on the other hand, Maidenswell slipping
out of our world and its modern rationalism. No matter how far up, down,
in, or out the mysterious universe had been pushed, the paranormality of
Maidenswell was not supposed to be. And so as &ldquo;bluff ghost activity&rdquo;
increased markedly beginning that night of the funeral, the village of
Maidenswell began a steep decline in fixed dimensionality, spatial
consistency, and uniform temporal direction. In short, the place had
become more <i>fey,</i> as the people of the area once often said. Besides
Nette and the twins, there were still a few other live inhabitants. And
yet it was as if they had forfeited their true independent existences
and fallen into enchanted versions of themselves. All was acquiescence
in Maidenswell.
</p>

<p>
For a few mundane matters, all things relying on electrical-magnetic
physics had failed village-wide and could not be made to work again,
which beyond electrical equipment and appliances included cell and
internet and their devices. Likewise, automotive engines would
mysteriously die and could not restart. And only one telephone of the
old landline type still worked and was connected to the outside world,
namely, the Sattelsby House phone.
</p>

<p>
Define functioning phone. Functioning in a crackling, circumscribed sort
of way, for example, allowing an outside connection only in those times
when something truly important needed to be discussed. In general, the
only consistent exception to these anomalies was Sattelsby House itself
where humans and spirits enjoyed full &ldquo;interstate&rdquo; communion, able to
carry on fairly well vis-à-vis the random debilitating metaphysical
eddies and vortexes besetting the rest of the village. It was as if
Maidenswell had been placed in a time machine&#x2014;and had landed badly
half-in, half-out of the past, half-in, half-out of physics, though
strangely purposeful in manners related to the Sattelsby clan.
</p>

<p>
And so as our story begins, Maidenswell was far more of a ghost town
than is imaginable, present, visible to the outside world, yet
inexplicably unknown, unknowable . . . in spite of the insistent
intrusiveness of modern era and its ability to machine-learn, big-data,
and Google-Street-View anything everything everywhere . . . in spite of
the modern era&rsquo;s relentless drive to turn any place with the least bit
of nostalgic charm, uniqueness, or substance into an overrun,
overdeveloped, overpriced mob scene. To be sure, there was a mystical
pall, nothing short of a /spell /of unknown origin or purpose over
Maidenswell.
</p>

<p>
We could go on for many more pages, if not chapters, exploring
Maidenswell&rsquo;s paranormality, as well as some of the adventures the
children got up to with Henry&#x2014;and we shall at some later time,
Maidenswell&rsquo;s metaphysics being, after all, one of our main topics. But
a more pressing problem has arisen, namely, that the father, Jimbo, has
thundered down from on high that Thea and Drew are to attend the public
high school in Torndale starting in the fall. Yes, <i>that /high school
for any of you familiar with it, or, for that matter, acquainted with
any dysfunctional American public high school. The call came just
yesterday, and at first poor Nette argued and tried to reason with
mulish Jimbo, but she knew from experience it was best to hold her
tongue when Captain J descended into his block-and-spew debate style as
he continued the plod of his general theme, as could be gleaned from,
&ldquo;My children will not be spoiled! They&rsquo;ll go out into the real world and
take their lumps! Sink or swim! Just like I did! /Carpe diem!&rdquo; /Henry
noted later that he had never cared for the phrase /carpe diem</i>, and had
always found those who used it to be braying asses. And so she fell into
a trance muttering yes, yes, I see, I see until she let slip &ldquo;gang
activity.&rdquo; And to be sure, Jimbo seemed nonplussed for a second or two
upon having this phrase land upon his ear from across the progressively
darkening Atlantic, though he managed a quick recovery to resume
justifying his edict all the more. Perverse as his logic might seem to
us, he was certain that a setting promising substandard education and
the threat of violence would be invaluably constructive and formative
for his children.
</p>

<p>
Bad as his latest meddling was,
</p>

<p>
Aunt Bernice and Henry were naturally in an uproar. Aunt Bernice could
not let it rest, and on the following day she called Jimbo back,
representing herself, as she had before with some success, as that
wealthy aunt of Jocelyn&rsquo;s, up from &ldquo;the city&rdquo; for a visit. And as she
could not actually hold a phone for any length of time, young Drew held
it for her while she pleaded their case for almost an hour. We will not
rehash the entire discussion, but suffice it to say Aunt Bernice argued
against the children attending a public high school, offering as &ldquo;a
widow of considerable means&rdquo; to provide the best tutors
year-round&#x2014;just as she, Nette, Henry, and various Saint Aggie faculty
had been doing with his tacit approval for the past years. Alas, but
this offer was rejected. At the very least it was humorous to hear her
attempts at modern slang&#x2014;humorous enough to realize that such a prim
and proper other-century lady had gathered in as much modern slang in
the first place. Jimbo, somewhat calmer than the previous evening, would
still not reconsider, adamant that his twins would not become, as he
repeated ad nauseam, &ldquo;namby-pamby,&rdquo; that &ldquo;mixing it up&rdquo; with the locals
would cure their shyness and prissiness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he means it,&rdquo; said ruefully smirking Nette after Drew had
hung up for Aunt Bernice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; exclaimed Henry, arching his eyebrows and staring ahead.
</p>

<p>
It was a stormy and unseasonably cool night in late August, possibly due
to all the additional metaphysical instability the extended interstate
contact between an off-site real-world person and a Maidens Head ghost
might have brought about. The whole group, twins, Nette, Aunt Bernice,
and Henry, were sitting in the well-appointed Victorian front parlor. A
&ldquo;cheery&rdquo; fire burned in the fireplace for mortals not used to
fifty-degree temperatures during what should have been the warmest time
of the year. For a good long while they could only stare into the
flames, each in their own way perplexed by the awkward skew of the
fulminant bad news.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so bad about the high school?&rdquo; asked Thea to break the
oppressive silence, albeit meekly since she already knew the answer was
a foregone of a foregone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We hardly know it,&rdquo; said Drew in knee-jerk support &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only ever
driven through on our way to Regis Gloom and Saint Aginore.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The twins traded nervous glances.
</p>

<p>
Silence but for the crackling fire.
</p>

<p>
Thea shrugged. &ldquo;And we can&rsquo;t go to the Regis Gloom high school?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Nette, &ldquo;wrong district.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Torndale is a&#x2014;&rdquo; began Nette, but she did not complete her thought as
Aunt Bernice&rsquo;s frown and narrowed eyes suggested she not.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not discuss this any longer in front of the children,&rdquo;
command-suggested Aunt Bernice. She eyed the other adults once again
sharply, and then turning to the children, &ldquo;Will you excuse us adults?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Bernice,&rdquo; mumbled Thea and Drew together, whereupon the rose
and left for the saloon-slash-music room. Soon a Brillon de Jouy piece
for piano and harpsichord could be heard.
</p>

<p>
As afternoon drifted into evening, the ghosts spoke hardly tenderly
about Torndale. They had known it from its rough, mean mill town days,
to its gangster-bootlegger days, to its modern boom times when, seven
years previous, it had become the site of a new medium-security prison.
The town was soaked in opiates and methamphetamine, and the over half of
the prison population were drug offeners. There was no doubt in ghost
minds that Torndale was a cursed location.
</p>

<p>
As a clouded, premature twilight descended, the group finally was quiet
and thoughtful. The fire popped and hissed, while scattered raindrops
hit the tall windows. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m of these times,&rdquo; said Nette finally, looking
first at Henry, then at Aunt Bernice. &ldquo;I suppose I can&rsquo;t see all of what
you see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Henry lifted his hands while shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;We see doom. It
is what drove us to God,&rdquo; he said, and then to Aunt Bernice, &ldquo;We daren&rsquo;t
extend ourselves to Torndale.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, no,&rdquo; exclaimed Aunt Bernice. &ldquo;There is no crossing that river
for us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nette&rsquo;s eyes darted from ghost to ghost. At times she would just behold
them as they shimmered. Other times she could talk to them for hours,
effectively pumping them for anything they could say about their era.
&ldquo;Care to elaborate?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As we&rsquo;ve told you, the Leister is a barrier,&rdquo; said Henry finally, with
an obvious tone of evasiveness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And---<i>why</i>?&rdquo; pressed Nette with a hint of sarcasm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doom, suffice it to say,&rdquo; said Henry ruefully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well, doom,&rdquo; replied Nette, pulling an ironically exaggerated
face.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, Henry flew up out of his chair (as only a ghost can) and
exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh come now, let&rsquo;s not give up hope so soon! Maybe things
will turn out for the better. After all, the children have no corporeal
friends their own age. Perhaps they&rsquo;ll find some nice young folks down
there.&rdquo; But at that very moment a bolt of lightening struck nearby with
a horrendous ear-splitting crash, followed in less than a second by a
window-shaking boom of thunder. &ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Henry sheepishly, looking out
the window.
</p>

<p>
Nette laughed, albeit nervously. The children rushed back into the
parlor with wide eyes. Aunt Bernice, however, had hidden her face. She
had often said Maidenswell would someday be cleaved off the bluffs by
lightening (or some other natural disaster) and thrown down into the
river. She claimed knowledge of geology reports which speculated the
village&rsquo;s thirty-acre half-circle of land rested on a Swiss-cheese-like
karst formation and, as such, was riddled with caves, fissures, and
underground streams. &ldquo;Yet one more reason Maidenswell should never have
been,&rdquo; she said ruefully.
</p>

<p>
The twins did and did not understand what the adults were saying about
Torndale, Thea having eavesdropped while Drew kept up the harpsichord
part. They were of course very precocious and advanced for their age,
but such conversations only excited their minds in a literal way,
awakening, of course, nothing deeper, nothing experiential.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No matter what, it will be an adventure,&rdquo; said Thea, smiling meekly.
</p>

<p>
The adults in unison shot her a stern look, guessing she had listened in
on their conversation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We met the Marksteiners last week, continued Thea. &rdquo;They seemed nice.
Maybe we can practice our German with them."
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Henry, grinning from ear to ear. &ldquo;As you said, they
were very impressed that you spoke so well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thanks to Nette,&rdquo; said Drew, who had rejoined the group. He then
thanked Nette for her dedicated tutelage in German, which, as he said,
had paid for itself in one brief but exhilarating conversation with
native speakers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who are these Marksteiners?&rdquo; asked Aunt Bernice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re from Germany,&rdquo; replied Nette, brightly for her. &ldquo;The father
took over the auto parts factory, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What sort of factory?&rdquo; asked Henry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Horseless buggy parts,&rdquo; replied Nette. &ldquo;Not been doing well lately. I
guess that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lambs to the slaughter,&rdquo; said Aunt Bernice sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do know the Marksteiner kids will be going to Torndale High,&rdquo;
continued Nette. &ldquo;We met the mother and kids at the store last week. Got
to practice my German! They have a seventeen-year-old daughter and a
sixteen-year-old son. Nice-looking kids. Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bright-eyed and bushy-tailed for the ragtag and bobtail,&rdquo; said Aunt
Bernice. &ldquo;Lambs to the slaughter. Pearls before swine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh Bernice, what do you say we cheer up a bit, eh?&rdquo; said Henry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes. Very well,&rdquo; said Aunt Bernice, straightening her back. &ldquo;Come
what may, we shall persevere. Yes, we shall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say, Thea,&rdquo; said Drew. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get our umbrellas and take a walk. We&rsquo;re
not too late for the theater.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s!&rdquo; replied Thea, enthusiastically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Children, before you go&#x2014;&rdquo; started Henry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; said the twins in unison.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Could you play us your Duruflé piece?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The twins looked at each other, slightly embarrassed. Drew spoke first:
&ldquo;I think Althie has the fugue half figured out, but mine&rsquo;s still not
ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thea?&rdquo; said Henry, his head tilted to one side.
</p>

<p>
The girl smiled wistfully, shrugged her narrow shoulders and went over
to the piano, the very beautiful used Bechstein grand their father had
bought for them last year as a reward for &ldquo;toughing out&rdquo; a summer camp
for disadvantaged and &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; youth. Before sitting down, she eyed
Drew and jerked her head indicating that he should join her. He caught
on and came to her side, sitting down gingerly on the extreme left side
of the bench. Satisfied that moral support was near, Thea finally began
the hauntingly contemplative basic theme of the second half of Maurice
Duruflé&rsquo;s /Prelude and Fugue On the Name Alain /with her right hand.
Soon, her left hand was weaving in a hypnotically beautiful and delicate
answer to her right hand&rsquo;s repeating and expanding melody. This
continued until the left took over a version of the melody in a new key,
while the right added another counterpoint. In no time a very complex
fugue had been summoned, at times becoming a masterful fantasy on the
melody, at times dying back into its original simplicity, then to roar
forth again with urgency. Drew filled in the foot pedal parts. Finally,
they brought the piece to its crescendo, a final flurry up the scale and
then powerful chords.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Marvelous, marvelous!&rdquo; cheered Henry, Nette too. Both were on their
feet, then joined by Aunt Bernice. Nette&rsquo;s clapping filled the room
normally, but Henry&rsquo;s and Aunt Berncie&rsquo;s seemed to be phased and
lost-sounding.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she amazing?&rdquo; exclaimed Henry. To be sure, the power and grace of
the piece had lifted the group&rsquo;s mood, as had been Henry&rsquo;s plan. &ldquo;Now,
Drew, you play us something.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, not after that, please,&rdquo; said Drew, grimacing, biting his lip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Please, Drew,&rdquo; pleaded Henry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right. All right.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that the modest youth sat back down at the Bechstein and dutifully
made his way through his own variations of Jehan Alain&rsquo;s /Choral Dorien
/and /Petite Pièce, /his sister adding the foot pedal parts on his left.
The pace was much slower, the mood much more somber and reflective, but
the applause and bravos just as loud from the others at the end.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must know,&rdquo; began Henry after their applause, &ldquo;that the children
transcribed both of their pieces themselves from the original organ
scores.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re just noodling around,&rdquo; said Drew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As when a sorcerer changes lead to gold!&rdquo; said Henry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can we go now?&rdquo; asked Thea with a child&rsquo;s pleading look.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you two be careful,&rdquo; said Nette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve heard tonight is special,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Tonight, a fairy
prince and his retinue will be in attendance. And they&rsquo;ve been known to
stand and attempt to sing along if the music pleases them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that everyone laughed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s on tonight?&rdquo; asked Nette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bach&rsquo;s St. Anne Prelude and Edwin Fischer playing Mozart&rsquo;s Piano
Concerto Number Twenty-two,&rdquo; said Drew.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What orchestra?&rdquo; asked Aunt Bernice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Mannheimers, pre-Mozart, I believe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, that should be interesting,&rdquo; said Henry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. De Quincy and Mr. Baudelaire are to be avoided,&rdquo; said Aunt Bernice
admonishingly. &ldquo;And at the first sign of any metaphysical trouble, you
come right back here in quick time! This is a very unsettled evening,
children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Auntie,&rdquo; said the twins in unison, laughing. At that they quickly
left the room.
</p>

<p>
Silence flooded back into the front parlor once the children had closed
the front door behind them. Finally Aunt Bernice said, &ldquo;That atrocious
man! That braying ass! How dare he?!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Charles? Charles Baudelaire? Oh he&rsquo;s not so bad once you get to know
him,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;He was just a bit excited that last time. He was
actually complimenting you, Bernice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Aunt Bernice, waving her hand. &ldquo;That sorry
excuse for a father of theirs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is their father, and he does pay the bills,&rdquo; said Nette, her eyes
wide with irony. &ldquo;And, for the most part, he has enough sense to stay
away and let us manage things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed. Once he&rsquo;s thrown a bomb into the room he tends to disappear
again,&rdquo; mumbled Aunt Bernice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He insisted on that summer camp for criminally insane youth last
summer. No great damage was done,&rdquo; continued Nette with a shrug. &ldquo;And he
wanted them to get jobs this summer, but we sandbagged on that long
enough. We&rsquo;re not as helpless as we think we are, and neither are the
kids.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have my niece and nephew working like common laborers. Imagine
the shame,&rdquo; exclaimed Aunt Bernice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Bernice, they&rsquo;ll be thick as thieves with the smart set in no
time,&rdquo; said Henry, jumping from his chair again. &ldquo;You underestimate
them. Your niece and nephew positively exude class, breeding, and
leadership, and the children of this era are positively smitten by them.
Yes, now that I think about it, this might all turn out nicely for them
after all. Or at least not be the disaster we expect.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Henry, Henry,&rdquo; said Aunt Bernice with a wave of her hand. &ldquo;Precious
little warning when your mood changes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Music, dear lady, music,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;Music is magic. I knew it would
cheer us all up. It has me immensely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Aunt Bernice jerked her head away in consternation, and then jerked
back, eyes flashing. &ldquo;My mood is always the appropriate mood. Never
doubt your mood, or try and change it abruptly to suit the company.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t have been so negative right in front of them,&rdquo; said Nette.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Truth might as well will out,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;But again I say, let&rsquo;s not
underestimate the children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alas, I fear&#x2014;as you can well imagine&#x2014;that their qualities will only
excite envy and resentment in the many brutes down there. And let&rsquo;s not
make any mistake, Henry, it is the brutes who rule the roost. They
always have.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know from experience what happens to bright, sensitive kids,&rdquo; said
Nette. &ldquo;We live in an era when&#x2014;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Brutes? /Brutes? /Oh, will you two leave off!&rdquo; cut in Henry with a
comical scowl, stamping his foot soundlessly. &ldquo;The history of the human
race is the story of the brute yielding to civilization. Just look at
any chieftain or war lord of the past. Eventually he must put down his
sword and rule his people. And in order to do so he must be civilized
and bring civilization to the fore. And then over the generations his
line becomes more and more gentrified. And so it has been since time
immemorial. The blood of wild, heathen Viking maidens flows in the veins
of Elizabeth of Austria.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did flow,&rdquo; added Nette. &ldquo;One of the more resentful brutes stuck a file
in her chest, if you recall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Henry, furrowing his brow, &ldquo;I did hear about that. That
swarthy nihilist killed her just the other day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been over a century,&rdquo; said Nette, winking, grinning sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My it&rsquo;s all so confusing. I saw her just the other day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I moved heaven and earth to get here and stay here,&rdquo; said Aunt Bernice
in her most distant voice to the ebbing flames of the fireplace. &ldquo;When
their mother was murdered&rdquo;&#x2014;Henry and Nette shot her nervous glances,
but didn&rsquo;t bring protest&#x2014;"I fought many battles to come here
substantially. It has cost a great deal&#x2014;and so much still sways in the
balance, you know&#x2014;but it had to be. It just had to be!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know the times have changed. And to a certain degree we must
acquiesce and not become outright meddlers. But every child deserves a
good start in life. Indeed. A child must receive a proper balance of
emotional warmth and intellectual stimulation. Children must have a
stable home and proper guidance. And when these things are lacking, a
child will, often as not, grow up stunted and at great risk of going
through life rudderless and unfulfilled. And that is why I came. I could
not let that happen to those lovely young people of Jocelyn&rsquo;s. I just
couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thea and Drew headed up steep and bending Leister Street until they
reached the village square. There was still some light despite the heavy
clouds. Going out into the Maidenswell night was indeed like stepping
back in history. The theater was seemingly the focal point of a portal
into the past. To be sure, Maidenswell seemed to relish in disobeying
one of modern science&rsquo;s most cherished rules, that is, the rule against
time travel back into the past.
</p>

<p>
Torndale High School, home of the Fighting Badgers, lay on the northeast
side of town, not far from the river. The main building had been built
just after World War I in a style an architectural historian might in a
generous mood call neoclassical. Again, the local limestone was in use,
as were bruise-red bricks with corrugated surfaces. The building faced
Locust Street, and on its far-north side stood a gymnasium which had
been added on in the early fifties. Very little grass or shrubbery was
to be seen as most of the grounds were covered in asphalt or gravel for
playgrounds or parking. Indeed, from the size of the parking lots alone,
Torndale High looked more like a factory where all the workers drove to
work.
</p>

<p>
Apparently, Jimbo&rsquo;s lawyer had already enrolled the children in the
school district as a letter for an &ldquo;intake interview&rdquo; had arrived in
their Torndale post office box the following Monday (Mail was no longer
delivered to Maidenswell.). The meeting was to be with the school
principle, a Mr. Frank Rucker, on the Thursday before the Labor Day
weekend. School would commence on the following Tuesday.
</p>

<p>
Nette and the children brainstormed about what to wear to school.
Although Thea and Drew did not share all of Nette&rsquo; goth subculture
proclivities, she had very much influenced their dress as they also
dressed dark, formal, and other-century. Still, Thea decided to forgo
her black Brontéian look for what could be described as Victorian
schoolgirl uniform: a black pleated skirt, a white blouse, knee socks,
and a black blazer. Drew grudgingly decided to set aside his &ldquo;Beau
Brummel Off To a Funeral&rdquo; look for a similar blazer, tie, and trousers
outfit. The next day, a Friday, they made a trip in the Benz to Boston,
first to their amazing tailor, a tall young man from Berlin, Gunther
Schneider, who specialized in &ldquo;couture d&rsquo;époque par excellence.&rdquo; Herr
Schneider came from a long line of clothiers, his surname in fact/ <i>was
the German word for tailor</i>. /Nette had first met Gunther at a party at
St. Aginore. He had recently arrived from Germany, and was wearing the
most unique and eye-catching blend of goth and medieval clothing she had
ever seen. Everyone was smitten by him, and his business thrived from
the start, serving the needs of the discriminating non-modernist
throughout the greater New England region. Yet he had to turn down the
twins on their latest request as he could not guarantee the uniforms in
time for school in just a week. Still, he was able to direct them to a
competitor who kept just such uniforms in stock for the myriad of prep
and parochial schools in the region. In luck, the children found exactly
what they wanted and were even able to have the St. Aginore coat of arms
stitched onto the front blazer pocket by an automated embroidery machine
while they waited.
</p>

<p>
Nette, in a moment of great ambivalence, had convinced
</p>

<p>
Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army, retired, Franklin Pierce Rucker was
already ten years in his position as principal of Torndale High School
and had seen limited success in his efforts to bring discipline and
better academic results to the troubled school. For various reasons,
momentum could never be sustained and every victory seemed to offset by
a new defeat. To put it mildly, he could not yet claim victory in the
war against bad behavior and bad academics. In fact, bad kids still
ruled the roost no matter what he did. The corner was not yet turned, as
he would freely admit.
</p>

<p>
His last permanent assignment before retiring from the Army had been
Washington, D.C., where he had found many civilian placement firms eager
to help the then forty-seven-year-old veteran African-American Army
officer with an exemplary record and references from the highest levels.
Although most of the offers were for &ldquo;six-figures&rdquo; and bore
lofty-sounding titles, Franklin Rucker had learned from his military
experience to avoid situations where duties and goals could not be
stated in a few simple sentences. It was for that reason that Light
Colonel Rucker had accepted the principalship at Torndale (at just under
one-hundred-thousand per year) as the Whiltshire County school board had
been quite clear about his duties, as well as the latitude and support
he would be given to accomplish these tasks. Indeed, his interview with
the board had been a very frank discussion between people who seemed to
speak the same language and share the same views. In fact, the scheduled
two-hour interview stretched into an all-afternoon love-fest, supper and
drinks at the Elks Club afterwards. The board members&#x2014;three men, one
of them black, two women, one of them black, and not one of them under
two-hundred pounds in weight, all with atrocious body mass
indexes&#x2014;made it clear that they needed a man just like Rucker to take
control of a school with serious discipline problems. Much attention was
given to the subject of gangs and how they dominated the community and,
thus, the schools.
</p>

<p>
Yet it wasn&rsquo;t until happy hour and a few stiff belts were under
everyone&rsquo;s very large belts that the really frank and honest talk
emerged, and when it did, it was as if a dam had burst. Indeed, finally
out on the table was the real fear: race. Apparently, Torndale had seen
an influx of blacks in the past decade, most connected familially to a
nearby state prison which had also been completed ten years previous.
Torndale had always been a rough town, but now race had made a bad
situation worse.
</p>

<p>
Although Light Colonel Rucker had been attached to various armored units
during his Army career, he eventually came to be utilized as a
troubleshooter for troop discipline and morale, especially while
attached to USAREUR Germany, a theater notorious for its morale
problems. Throughout the post-Vietnam seventies and into the early
eighties, the Army in Germany had been rife with racial tension, poor
morale, and rampant drug and alcohol abuse. However, by the mid-eighties
the problem seemed to be in remission, and he, Rucker, based for much of
his career at Army Headquarters in Heidelberg, Germany, was given much
of the credit. His approach was simple and classic military: develop the
best intelligence possible, then bring overwhelming force to bear on the
enemy. And yet this regimen was not bearing fruit here in the civilian
world. He could be as strict as he wanted during school hours, but peace
and order dissolved in the afternoon when the kids left his control and
reentered the community where they reloaded all the bad once again.
</p>

<p>
And now there sat before him three of the weirdest white people he had
ever seen. He knew white people could be down-to-earth, and he also knew
they could be incomprehensible, from planets never charted. In Germany,
for example, he had seen an entire nation of white people so incredibly
white that the white Southerners back in Tennessee seemed almost
Jamaican by comparison. And like most blacks, he instinctively
associated such extreme whiteness with racism, for they most obviously
were not playing along with the modern egalitarian &ldquo;nobody should be
better than anyone else&rdquo; game. How could privileged, elitist whites not
be racist? he wondered.
</p>

<p>
After shaking hands and smiling bigger than he had in recent memory, he
settled back into his oversized leather chair and launched into
chit-chat about the unseasonably cool weather. Long purged, though, was
the small-town Tennessee habit of making jocular, presumably
well-intentioned racial distinctions; hence, he did not say &ldquo;&#x2026;and
y&rsquo;all must like it a little cooler.&rdquo; The next impulse he suppressed was
to ask them if they were Addams Family fans. Instead, he gushed on about
how smart their uniforms were, that seeing them looking so nice made him
revisit his old idea of introducing uniforms to Torndale High, and what
did they think of that, and would they like to be on a committee to help
design the uniforms? His audience&#x2014;having had almost no experience with
the greater African-American America&#x2014;remained wide-eyed and silent
until Principal Rucker finally lurched on to the subject of their
previous education. Now Nette spoke, and spoke for a good ten minutes
straight, delineating exactly what she, Aunt Bernice, and other tutors
had accomplished with the children in the past few years: chemistry (up
to organic), biology, botany, Latin, Attic Greek, German, French,
mathematics (up to linear algebra, differential equations, and
analysis), English literature (including all of Shakespeare), and
philosophy (including Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Fichte, as well as
Heidegger and Sartre). She explained how the children were accomplished
autodidacts on the piano. She showed Colonel Rucker Drew&rsquo;s most recent
thesis&#x2014;hand-written, hand bound&#x2014;on why the main character of
Grimmelhausen&rsquo;s /Simplicisimus /exemplified Spinoza&rsquo;s four levels of
human intelligence over the course of his adventures in the Thirty Years
War. Colonel Rucker knew all about the Thirty Years War, being an avid
amateur war historian, and he wanted to chime in, but he held his tongue
instead, certain that Drew&rsquo;s thesis had nothing to do with that war&rsquo;s
peculiar mix of standard battles and guerrilla-style fighting. &ldquo;So you
don&rsquo;t use computers?&rdquo; he said finally.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t really have electricity in Maidenswell,&rdquo; said Nette with a
raised eyebrow. &ldquo;And besides&#x2014;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of opportunity to use one here!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
cutting in. &ldquo;Our computer lab is top-notch. You&rsquo;ll have unlimited
research capabilities right here. We have broad-band Internet, iron-clad
filtering and security, and unlimited printing&#x2014;you just pay for any
paper past two-hundred sheets. &rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said a hardly enthused Nette, and the children glanced at one
another.
</p>

<p>
The second after the Holcombes had left his office, Frank Rucker knew
three things: One, they would stick out like the sorest thumbs the
school had ever seen&#x2014;worse even than those punky, gothy theater kids;
two, the school had virtually nothing to offer them academically; and
three, they would fit well into his new &ldquo;weed-and-seed&rdquo; program. Indeed,
Frank Rucker&rsquo;s daughter was a city councilperson in Chattanooga,
Tennessee, and was in charge of community&rsquo;s so-called <i>Weed-and-Seed</i>
program, a government initiative designed to turn around bad urban
neighborhoods. As she had explained it, first you come down heavy on the
bad element, then you follow up immediately with good alternatives&#x2014;all
done with as much &ldquo;shock and awe&rdquo; as you can bring to bear. Being a
former mechanized artillery officer, Frank Rucker felt great affinity
for any plan employing liberal amounts of shock and awe.
</p>

<p>
The problem with Torndale High was how very little there was to work
with at the top, that is, for the seed portion of Weed and Seed. But now
with the Holcombes&#x2014;as well as the two German kids he had met that
morning who were also academically somewhere comparable to American
college undergraduates&#x2014;he could begin to build a core of &ldquo;model
students,&rdquo; i.e, the &ldquo;awe&rdquo; of the seed part of the plan. Four good kids
wasn&rsquo;t much, but he was literally fighting one kid at a time in his
efforts to achieve better academic performance. It wouldn&rsquo;t be easy,
though. The bad element, the bullies, the gang-bangers would undoubtedly
go after them, but he and the staff would be ready. That night over
dinner he spoke at length with his wife about the new kids and his
plans.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Frank, you know the gang-bangers will be on them the minute you
turn your back,&rdquo; said Louelle Rucker.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Louie, me and the faculty, the guards, hell, the janitors!
<i>everybody&rsquo;s</i> going to watch these kids like hawks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are they going to take? It sounds like they&rsquo;re ready for grad
school at Oxford already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They can do physics with Ted Simon, and Kathy Stockbridge&rsquo;s English lit
is solid, and then Spanish, and&#x2014;and they can take some stuff at
Leister-CC. That&rsquo;s where Dale Ryman has taken the Thespian Club. Their
guardian said they were taking courses at St. Aginore. We can arrange
credit for that easy enough. I mean, that&rsquo;s the least of my worries.&rdquo; He
waved his fork in dismissal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to give it one more year and then we&rsquo;re back to either DC
or Tennessee, right?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right, right,&rdquo; said Rucker, smirking, eying his wife askance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re still mad as hornets over you canceling football last year.
Pretty soon they&rsquo;re going to start burning crosses on our lawn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Football players who rape and assault adults, and then lie and cover up
don&rsquo;t play football,&rdquo; said Rucker with heat. &ldquo;And girls who aren&rsquo;t
ladies don&rsquo;t represent their school on the court, either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This reminds me of Augsburg.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You were a lieutenant attached to that artillery outfit. Always out in
the field. Always on maneuvers. No free time, no private life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo; Frank Rucker looked out across the dining room, his mind&rsquo;s eye
seeing vignettes from his first permanent assignment, Augsburg, Germany,
nineteen-seventy-three to seventy-six. He clucked his tongue and shook
his head. &ldquo;What a shit-hole! Hash smoking out in the open. Troops
dropping dead from barbiturates and whiskey. Race riots. Black troops
disobeying orders from white officers. Man, was that hell! Meeting you
was the only good thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Back then you could send &rsquo;em off to Fort Leavenworth, Frank, but you
don&rsquo;t have that kind of leverage here. And it&rsquo;s going to catch up to you
someday. So why don&rsquo;t we go back to D.C. and you take one of those board
member gigs where you just act nice and talk all wise and knowing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Louie, baby, I told you, I&rsquo;m no good looking pretty in a suit. I&rsquo;ve got
to have a mission, a goal&#x2026;. I&rsquo;ll sort this thing out. And besides,
who&rsquo;s going to buy this house? We&rsquo;d take a bath if we tried to sell
right now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The school board won&rsquo;t go for school uniforms. You know that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But we do have a zero-tolerance of gang clothes. That was the first
step. And the police don&rsquo;t let no one dressed gang-style near the
school. No thumpity-thump-in-the-trunk in the parking lots, neither.
Honey, it&rsquo;s moving in the right direction.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Another year?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yeah, yeah, a year.&rdquo; He waved his hand, smirking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You think you can do it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m giving it my best shot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Honey, this town&rsquo;s got a history. I was talking to&#x2014;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hang on, Louie,&rdquo; interrupted Rucker. "You&rsquo;re not from rural Tennessee.
<i>Every /town in the South has /history."</i>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re right. I&rsquo;m from Chicago, a utopia of racial harmony where
the Polish and the Irish had us black folk over for dinner every Sunday
noon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laughter, albeit low-level.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Honey,&rdquo; began Rucker again, &ldquo;I told you my plan. It&rsquo;s simple: Promote
the hell out of the good kids. Shut down, run off, otherwise neutralize
the bad kids. Pull as many of the in-between kids as you can into the
good camp. Keep the test scores rising. Keep the students off the police
report. Keep the girls in contraceptives, the boys from openly groping
them. That&rsquo;s all a modern high school principal can do. That&rsquo;s all they
expect. And I can do it. It&rsquo;s not that complicated.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling you, Frank, this is an ugly-assed town with an ugly-assed
past.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing was as bad as Augsburg, Louie. And you didn&rsquo;t know the South,
neither.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The tall, former beauty queen, former track star shrugged her shoulders.
&ldquo;Okay, Frank. But there&rsquo;s something creepy about this town. You remember
what Mama said last winter, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;White folk don&rsquo;t scare me no more, Louie, and neither do their ghosts.
That was an old Klan tactic, getting black folk all worried about ghosts
and shit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Okay then.&rdquo; She smirked at her husband. &ldquo;Okay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on now, we&rsquo;ve been picking our way through the white minefield all
our lives. And so what? So here&rsquo;s new wrinkle to the same old same old.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The couple of thirty-five years was silent for a minute as they finished
their supper. Finally, Louelle spoke: &ldquo;You know, those Holcombe kid&rsquo;s
mother was killed by one of the rednecks. Hit her going sixty on a
snowmobile. He&rsquo;s doing time over at Chalter for reckless homicide.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know that. That&rsquo;s some harsh shit.&rdquo; Rucker looked away
quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He said it was an accident and he was drunk and all, but the evidence
was clear he seen her and ran her down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lord have mercy.&rdquo; He sucked at his teeth loudly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You want to hear about the witches?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What on earth, Louie?&rdquo; Rucker gave his wife an ironical look of
surprise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I heard the murderer&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s the town witch, a real nasty piece of
work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;White trash, Louie, white trash. I know all about white trash.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mean, nasty white trash with big-assed attitudes and guns.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So what are you saying, honey?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know. I guess I&rsquo;m saying you&rsquo;ll have your hands full
this fall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like always. Like I don&rsquo;t know that?&rdquo; He laughed, clapped his hands,
and rubbed them together. &ldquo;So what&rsquo;s for dessert?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m eating cheesecake, but you&rsquo;re on a diet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Louie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I jog four miles every other day&#x2014;all year-round. You play golf once a
week&#x2014;in the summer, riding around in a cart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rucker was silent for a time, but when his wife returned to the table
with only one piece of cheesecake he spoke up, &ldquo;And I was just hearing
from the police chief that he thinks the race thing is settling down. So
now you&rsquo;re going on about some voodoo crap.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Louelle Rucker eyed her husband intently, impassively. &ldquo;Some black kids
integrate. I&rsquo;m not surprised. But that doesn&rsquo;t make the gangs go away.
That doesn&rsquo;t make the respect thing any better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re right. Damn. When I hear that thumpity-thump music?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I turn around and see it coming out of a white kid&rsquo;s car?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Man, how times have changed!&rdquo; Rucker shook his head, grinning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank Hollywood for that. You remember we went to your uncle&rsquo;s funeral
down in Sparta?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uh-huh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re all talking about this or that white movie star?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uh-huh. Uh-huh.&rdquo; Rucker&rsquo;s smile turned to laughter. &ldquo;Backwoods
Tennessee black folk going on about some white dudes in some damn
movie.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve taken them over and they&rsquo;ve taken over us. We overlap. But not
really. And that&rsquo;s going to be a problem someday. So which end&rsquo;s up? I
don&rsquo;t know. I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Me neither, Louie. Me neither. All I know is they got the door cracked
for folks like us. The rest? The nappy-headed? Hell, everybody pretends
they don&rsquo;t exist no more. Discards. Recycles. Bolos.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Unless they can play ball or do rap. Right. Or act the loud fool and
make white folks blush and laugh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uh-huh. You know how white folk used to go see horror films with
Dracula and Frankenstein and all that? Mummy and Wicked Witch? Well, now
they just watch the mean street niggers doing their rap videos for a
scare.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uh-huh. Uh-huh.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Laugher.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes sir! Promote &rsquo;ol Franklin Rucker to colonel and call civil rights a
success! Sure enough! But we&rsquo;re not looking Mr. Gift Horse in the mouth,
now are we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Guess not. Still got credit cards and mortgage to pay off. And I like
driving over to Whiltshire in my Camary and buying eighteen-dollar
cheesecake from the Coöp.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uh-huh. Sure enough. And I want some new golf clubs. Can&rsquo;t quit now.
No, sir. Can&rsquo;t stop now.&rdquo;
</p>

He succeeded in Germany by getting inside the average troop&rsquo;s head. He

more of the students into a nucleus built around them. Would the bad

Chapter 2: The Embarrassment of Heaven
</p>

<p>
Nette had a very strange dream early that night. She went downstairs and
found Henry, Charles Baudelaire, and Thomas de Quincey sitting in
silence around the fire. The men rose and bowed to her, seemingly
nonplussed to see her in her nightgown.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear Nette,&rdquo; exclaimed Henry, whatever brings you out of your chambers
as this hour?"
</p>

<p>
All eyes went to the large wall clock, which read one-thirty-three.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I just had the strangest dream,&rdquo; she said wistfully.
</p>

<p>
Witch: There&rsquo;s magic, deep magic here. Everywhere, really. But humans
don&rsquo;t understand it. I don&rsquo;t understand it, either, but I can feel it,
sometimes see it, and it talks to me&#x2014;sometimes. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean
anything. People come to me because they think I can get it for them.
</p>

<p>
When I was a kid I consorted with what turned out to be an evil spirit,
and it cost me&#x2014;a lot. It possessed my brother and at a pool, he held
me under until I passed out. For a while I was dead, and I was in the
spirit&rsquo;s world. Imagine being as scared as you&rsquo;ve ever been, all while
being electrocuted. They brought me back, but from then on magic was
</p>

<p>
Usually, the magic doesn&rsquo;t care about us humans. But you&rsquo;re up in
Maidenswell and it&rsquo;s running quite a show up there. I might come up
there sometime and take a look around, if you don&rsquo;t mind.
