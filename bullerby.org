** A nervous coexistence

Since arriving in Duluth in 2003 with my Kansas Mennonite
(non-conservative, Northern German/Dutch) wife and our twin boys,
finally settling in Grand Marais in 2007, I've been updating a growing
list of /issues/ I have with this Northern Midwestern Minnesota social
and cultural scene, especially here north of Duluth on the North Shore
of Lake Superior. How do I describe these supposedly fellow humans
around here? Certainly not all of them, but so many strike me as
insular, provincial parochial, emotionally immature, stiltedly
intentionally anti-intellectual dumbed-down, to be sure, an oddly
studied déclassé forced unsophistication. Again, not all, but so many
seem to be chasing after some hodgepodge of recursive [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality][hyperreality]]
tropes, come here to live some fantasy of what modern living is
supposed to be. I call them the Flannel Shirt People, the Carhartt
Filson Steger-Mukluk Wintergreen-Anorack Nazis, the Red Green Show
extras who drive Jeep Cherokees, Toyota Tundras, and Subaru Outbacks,
those insisting life in this Arrowhead Region must be the adult
continuation of their Kumbaya around the campfire childhoods.

Grand Marais: North Shore Ground Zero. Besides the minority
born-and-raised-here local-yokels who've long ago chucked their
Scandinavian origins to assimilate into the greater MAGA Trump
populace southwards, we feature two more big Venn diagram circles: the
well-off, DFL-voting retirees, and the middle- to upper-class
suburbanites come here to make this ten-million-acre wedge of
wilderness their Jack Fucking London! Ernest Fucking Hemingway! Robert
Fucking Service! lost Alaskan county fantasy park.[fn:3]

Is this just sour-grape troll-baiting? I fully understand that all of
these Jimmy Billy Jack London Thudpucker She Ran Calling Wildfire
types are simply after some sort of authenticity, some truth, purity,
simplicity, innocence, some modicum of reality in their lives, and,
yes, I suppose it's all good on some level this trying some new
tunnel's escapist promise. But really, how did I, someone wanting,
doing basically the same things, get so jaded and anti towards all my
fellow North Shore reinvention invasives? Why am I so out of sync with
their particular version of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottagecore][Cottagecore]] hyperreality?[fn:4] Why would
I suddenly be so hyper-critical of those doing essentially what I've
done, namely, the hot-swapping of off-the-shelf lifestyles? I blame
Europe and my almost ten years there, specifically Germany and
Switzerland, for it was in Europe that I became exposed (indoctrinated
in-) to the Old World way of thinking and being, something essentially
hidden, under the radar of nearly all Americans.

As I've explained before elsewhere, Europe, the Old World, the Eastern
Hemisphere in general, is working with /four/ dimensions, while New
World Americans know only the three dimensions of standard physical
space. The fourth dimension is of course Einstein's time, but in a
social-cultural sense /time as history/ ... which is necessary in
order to have any sort of truly /rooted culture/. Americans, lacking
history and real rootedness, are like children fighting to dominate
the ever-changing Zeitgeist, an endless game of King of the Hill won
by those with progressively less and less actual value or merit, just
mouth, elbows, and chutzpah. That is to say, we're just kaleidoscoping
churn, with nary anything of real or lasting value coming forth. As a
German once said to me, You Americans are trying to put together a
jigsaw puzzle missing half the pieces and no box lid to know what it's
supposed to look like. And so you just cut and glue and tape some
abstraction together, then fight over whose is the right
picture. Indeed, such were the broadsides I took while trying to play
the Jimmy Steward aw-shucks All-American Boy over there...

Alas, but I'm the red-blooded Midwestern American who got
/verdeutscht/[fn:5] and now can't resettle back in his land of origin,
hard as he has tried.[fn:6] Germany especially was my Hogwarts where I
was sorted into the Ravenclaw House, i.e., the intellectuals. And ever
since it has been this strange Euro-instilled /noblesse oblige/
driving me to keep learning, keep exploring and growing
intellectually---which has put me increasingly at odds with the
Kumbaya singers, the ex-suburbanites who have reinvented themselves as
these quasi-rugged outdoors types who cannot, will not ever be caught
sounding intellectual. Here an odd sort of unspoken anti-intellectual
brain-shaming, reverse discrimination against learnedness is /de
rigueur/. Apparently it's hip to play the ignorant peasant.

** Yet another /Halloweenus interruptus/

I am ruled by my Dark Muse, and being darkly-inclined, Halloween is my
premiere, dare I say /sacred/ holiday. But once again I was surrounded
by The Flannel Shirt People who simply don't, won't get Halloween,
some of whom will intentionally, actively work against it. I'm saying
this burg is majority Halloween shunners, Samhain Eve putzes. But what
really brought this home to me this year was the screening of the
original /Beetlejuice/ by the Grand Marais Film Society on the 25th of
October. Here was to be the only visible, outwardly public
acknowledgement of Halloween---besides the cramped, nervous
trick-or-treating where helicopter parents anxiously hovered over
their trooping children in the afternoon! (Can't risk darkness!) Read
on.

I arrived that night at the ACA[fn:7] auditorium to an almost full
house. Promising. But then heart-sinkage when I noticed here were
mainly the usual flannel-shirted suspects. Then to my horror they
played [[https://youtu.be/pyQJe6vH73M?si=9eXWyUXVskqKMdvU][this video]] from the local singing group /Basalta/ as a
preview. Suffice it to say, there could not have been a more opposite
vibe to /Beetlejuice/ and the general gothy Halloween spirit than this
next-gen Kumbaya folksinging. These were Millennial women with their
strong take-no-prisoners Feminism 2.0 singing their uplifting (sic)
song.

But then I have history with this community's treatment of
Halloween. Our very first Halloween back in 2008 was a sober awakening
to the Dark-phobic attitudes when the then-wife and I tried to put on a
dark "Halloween Poetry Reading" at the Art Colony's old church
space. We distributed fliers featuring the brilliant Paulia Cassidy's
gothy illustration inviting the community to snacks and gothic,
Halloween-themed, Poesque poetry and music:

#+begin_export html
<a href="https://www.paulinafae.com/" target="_blank"><img src="./images/PaulinaFaeMyCrowd.png" width="800" alt="Paulina Fae My Crowd"></a>
<span class="cap">Paulina Cassidy's My Crowd</span>
#+end_export

Long short: It was a flop, as only a few people---mainly kids, i.e.,
trick-or-treaters come for the snacks---trickled in throughout the
evening. We had advertised the event as open mic as well. But when
anyone did "contribute" it seemed intentionally, stick-in-the-eye
contrarian to our gothy dark theme. For example, one individual just
had to read sundry North-woodsy poems (mainly Robert Service)
/completely/ unrelated to Halloween. As you can imagine, we came away
shocked and defeated. Though we shouldn't have been surprised as we
had heard the main bar in town, the Gunflint Tavern, always featured a
Reggae band for Halloween, intentionally aiming to counter the
dreary-gloomy darkening season with happy, cheery, uplifting, let's
imagine we're vacationing in sunny Jamaica spirits! Alas, what sort of
people must needs /hate/ and /cancel/ Halloween so? Why, these
intellectually emotionally minimalist North Shorers, that's who...

And so the lights dimmed and /Beetlejuice/ began---and I slowly got
the indescribable feeling that me, myself, and I was the only person
in that three-hundred-plus audience who were getting, enjoying
it.[fn:8] Of course I'd seen it many times, but as the end came round
I was the only one stirring. In other words, nobody else had ever seen
it---and had no idea it was about to end. I left during the
credits---as did a woman dressed "office goth." We chatted a bit in
the parking lot---she was just visiting from the Cities---and I left
too devastated to see straight. A sinusoidal blind fury/deep
depression set in and had me despondent for the next few days. But
what to do? Stay and fight or pack and leave? As I've said before,
this place, the /natural surroundings/ of this Arrowhead locale itself
is so perfect, darkly-speaking. But why do I seem to be the only one
who gets this?

** The Sutter Brothers' performance

And then came the Sutter Brothers' performance. The audience at the
Grand Marais Public Library on that November 8 Friday afternoon
numbered north of fifty, south of a hundred, nearly all Boomers like
me, the DNA visibly skewed Scandihoovian, and, my knowing at least a
third of them, people who would have partied with Fred Rogers and
bristled at Saturday Night Live's mocking sketches of him. Here were
the Harris-Walz voters, /A Prairie Home Companion/ devotees, students,
supporters of [[https://northhouse.org/][North House Folk School]], marchers under the Rainbow
Flag, attendees of all sorts of "workshops" on New Age esoterica,
again, a subset of the usual suspects. But how dare I disparage?
After all, this is their bailiwick. I'm the odd-man-out here. They're
the one whose childhood summers included trips up to the North Shore
to sing Kumbaya round the campfire. And here they were again---round
an ersatz file, making their imaginary s'mores.

Musician Ross began with an actual children's campfire song, then came
a Bill Staines song. The goth in me cringed spastically, Bill Staines
of course being the antidote to the dark sarcasm and nihilistic
cynicism of John Denver. But legion were the people who ate up Bill
Staines, who never understood that the film /A Mighty Wind/ [fn:9] was
mocking them and their overwrought, saccharine sucky folk and the
uniquely American milieu behind it.

What stays with us emotionally from childhood? Whither childhood
sentimentalism?  And why is one man's sentimentality another's mawkish
kitsch? Reaching into our gentler core, sharing such matters of the
heart is surely fraught. The main problem is vulnerability and
triggering defensive responses. We have a /logic train/ which we
mistakenly assume is dominant, but then an /emotion braid/ too, which
reaches far into the past where it can become hopelessly frayed and
tangled up. I've heard Garrison Keillor can be short if not irascible
whenever an East Coast city-slicker sneers or casts aspersions on his
Northern Midwest shtick. Indeed, it's all good until somebody is
clearly not playing along, paying proper homage. And then out come the
knives to drive off the reprobate---as if he were a blasé, smirking
Roman Catholic discovered at the frenzied peak of a Southern Baptist
tent revival.

One inner sanctum comparison might be with my parents who were both
born in 1935,[fn:10] college-educated (Washington University,
St. Louis), and vaguely intellectual. They lived in tumultuous,
ever-changing times, but their generation's penetralium was, to be
sure, soft and gentle and compassionate---all while being very grownup
and ultimately fatalistic ... as if old souls who had come this way
many times before and experienced mainly tragedy. Indeed, they came
and went oh so fatalistically, almost unnoticed.

Not us Boomers! loud, brash, trouble-making, facile, feckless "new
souls" as we were. We talked big, delivered little. Our "rock stars"
sang embarrassingly silly lyrics, tore up hotels, and smashed guitars
on stage.[fn:11] But now middle-aged, older, dazed and confused, we
feel the need to finally begin sorting out, laying claim to some
manner of adulthood---if it's not too painful and troublesome.

And so what do Bart Sutter, Sigurd Olson, and Sam Cook all have in
common? My first stab might be they typically lay out impressionistic
but strangely noncommittal vague musings: one foot in some hazy
Northern European /peasant/ headspace and the other in our always
tightly circumscribed, played-down American college-educated
caste. It's as if nobody dare step up and actually say anything
consequential lest it sound too intellectual, lest some paragraph of
/[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante][Jantelagen]]/ be violated. And so up float shiny soap bubbles that must
never drift above a cultural-intellectual ceiling only coming up to
the knee. Was East Germany, is North Korea this repressed, repressive?

This might be explained, ultimately forgiven as yet another escape
route from our domineering modern urban-intellectual cult of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism][literary
realism]], i.e., the later nihilistic realism where Faulkner, Nabokov,
Samuel Beckett types dealt in protagonists who only manage to savage
one another emotionally spiritually, and no social ill or problem is
ever really address as realism initially set out to do. And yet when I
read Sutter's poetry or non-fiction (/Cold Comfort/) I can't help but
get a /Mod-real Lite®/ vibe. He still wants to hint at existential
meaningless. Why, then? In order to fit in with this general modern
trend? Don't beseech or preach, mind your Jante Ps and Qs, keep
everything at the Scandi-peasant kitchen philosophy level, and all
will be fine.

Sutter, Olson, and Cook often invoke nature. But the emotion, the
transport relayed by the Romantic Era poets such as the Brontë Sisters
or Wordsworth is completely missing. I've claimed certain Romantic Era
poetry borders on a new Northern European nature paganism. But when I
read our local guys, I never feel like the North Woods is anything but
vaguely "inspirational," always this big force majeure thingy, though
held maddening anti-sublime. I don't mean to say this is not
interesting writing, for how else could one be so Minnesotan formulaic
conformist except with great skill?  They have spoken to, reached the
nervous /Angsthase/[fn:12] Minnesota audience and have gain fame, as
well as some coin doing it.

That believing life isn't to be figured out, simply lived won't lead
to hedonism and stunt metaphysical growth. This is a big blind spot I
have with our Northern Midwestern writers. [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Erdrich][Louise Erdrich]] is probably
the widest-known Minnesotan novelist and has enjoyed widespread
recognition and success. And yet pick up any of her books and you
experience the obligatory miasma of existential meaninglessness, i.e.,
localized Camus derivative. Erdrich protagonists are mostly victims,
oppressed---and recompense is thin on the ground. As with most
Mod-Real Lite writing, her human can only flux through life eking out
an existence and stumbling across the occasional bits of
compassion. Indeed, kindness and compassion, relief in general are
like oxygen molecules stingily meted out just when suffocation is
nigh, just when things can't get any worse. And the elites call these
fictional vulture sites great literature...

Why do America's supposedly creative people fear beauty, forever
shunning and dancing around it? Why must their artistic output so
often have that seemingly obligatory whiff of pee, cow shit? Why is
openly expressing any sort of profundity beyond some moron's rare
semi-wise uttering like farting loudly at Thanksgiving dinner? Why is
watery peasant kitchen philosophy all we dare sidle up to? This
Northern audience likes its cheesy, schmaltzy folk music, but then
must have its protagonists grimy, low-word-count dullards and
simpletons---always this hopeless, low-rent, proletariat version of
the Byronic hero. Again, the intentionality, the necessity of this
subculture feels so---bad. It's one thing to deal in mixed messages,
to play with the gradient of light and dark. But to incessantly
barrage the reader with "life is ultimately meaningless but let's
scrounge some kindness" leaves goodness at best accidental
optional. Forever these seeds landed on stone, only to germinate and
quickly whither in the heat and drought. And that's supposed to be
great literature?

** Bullerby Syndrome? Nej tack...

As I understand, modern-day Old World Scandinavian social scientists
have come here to study our isolated, time-capsuled New World
immigrant Scandinavians. The most obvious dichotomy is the religious
hangover, i.e., that here in the New World is a Lutheranism long since
faded away from the Scandinavian homelands. Meaning here are yet
strong echoes of that yesteryear Scandi-Lutheran Calvinist-Pietist
which is marked by strict morality, metaphysical and emotional
minimalism.[fn:13]

One of the sadder things about my time in Scandi Minnesota has been
watching any sort of Scandihoovian roots efforts see tepid reactions,
at best flounder.

Here is no real culture? Curiously, I have found the stray soul of
Scandi descent who has tried, largely unsuccessfully to make
connections with the homeland. Here in Grand Marais we have a woman
who has tried to whip up interest in all things Swedish. There are a
handful of people who can speak some language. But it's dying out. The
high water mark was probably the Nordic Roots Festival at the Cedar
Cultural Center in Minneapolis, the last year being 2008.

What is known as the Bullerby Syndrome is
the idealization of that particular other-century

** Poling and Mitchell's /Jack & the Ghost/

America ... this great continent-wide land initially colonized by
Euro-peasants ... forever doomed to arrested, stunted culture
formation ... held back by peasantisms never to be overcome
.... doomed to an eternal, Sisyphean /cultura interruptus/. Alas...

I suppose what annoyed me the most about Poling and Michell's /Jack &
the Ghost/ is, once again, it dared not be too, what?, cultivated,
erudite, highbrow literati. It presents itself as a gothic tragedy, a
Lake Superior version of, say, Theodor Storm's /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rider_on_the_White_Horse][Schimmelreiter]]/,[fn:14] or
/The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea/ [fn:15] but immediately
cuts expectations by presenting itself as a quasi-children's picture
book with Mitchell's faux naïve art. The main protagonist is a
fisherman named Jack. As the pages turn, we never get the impression
that Jack has much mental or emotional maturity beyond a
grade-schooler. Jack, seemingly a simpleton, has lost his fiancee in a
storm on what is called (lower-case) "the great lake," thus Lake
Superior, before the village of Greyshore (British English spelling
grey), which must be Grand Marais. And yet the creators have
redesigned/rebuilt Greyshore/Grand Marais as Hawthorne's Salem or
Lovecraft's Marblehead Massachusetts with crowded-together
eighteenth-century clapboard buildings and cobblestone streets,
certainly nothing like the real Grand Marais...

There was a time in film when men and women were portrayed by---men
and women, i.e., grownups. Then came the era of dumbed-down persona,
e.g., the eternal pretty high school boy look of Beau Bridges, Brad
Pitt, and Tom Cruise. When we see Sarah Miles (below) in /The Sailor
Who Fell from Grace with the Sea/ we know we are looking at a grown
woman of some class and breeding---which is of course eschewed by so
many today.

[[file:images/SarahMiles.png]]

My Kansas Mennonite wife and I came to Duluth back in 2003, moved up
the shore to Knife River, finally landing in Grand Marais
in 2007. Disappointment, disenchantment grew, however, and in 2014 she
just had to get back to her people. And so we packed up and headed to
Northern Indiana where the Anabaptists are dominant and she could
attend a Mennonite seminary.





Why Jack must be a peasant fisherman while Richard Burton and
Elizabeth Taylor's characters in /The Sandpiper/ are denizens of the
day's general culture.

This particular Minnesotan Scandihoovian subculture.
