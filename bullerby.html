<p>
Since arriving in Duluth in 2003 with my Kansas Mennonite
(non-conservative, Northern German/Dutch) wife and our twin boys,
finally settling in Grand Marais in 2007, I&rsquo;ve been updating a growing
list of <i>issues</i> I have with this Northern Midwestern Minnesota social
and cultural scene, especially here north of Duluth on the North Shore
of Lake Superior. How do I describe these fellow humans around here?
Certainly not all of them, but so many strike me as insular,
provincial parochial, emotionally immature, stiltedly intentionally
anti-intellectual dumbed-down, an oddly studied déclassé forced
unsophistication. Again, not all, but so many seem to be chasing after
some hodgepodge of recursive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality">hyperreality</a> tropes, come here to live
out some fantasy of what modern post-suburban wilderness living is
supposed to be. I call them the Flannel Shirt People, the Carhartt
Filson Steger-Mukluk Wintergreen-Anorack Nazis, the Red Green Show
extras who drive Jeep Cherokees, Toyota Tundras, and Subaru
Outbacks. Those insisting life in this Arrowhead Region must be the
adult continuation of their Kumbaya around the campfire childhoods.
</p>

<p>
Grand Marais: North Shore Ground Zero. Besides the minority
local-yokel born-and-raised-heres who&rsquo;ve mainly assimilated into the
greater MAGA Trump populace southwards, we feature two more big Venn
diagram circles: the well-off, DFL-voting retirees, and the middle- to
upper-class suburbanites come here to make this wedge of wilderness
their Jack Fucking London! Ernest Fucking Hemingway! Robert Fucking
Service! lost Alaskan county fantasy park.<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.1716693' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.1716693' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
Oddly, all this backwoods fantasy-silo stuff seems to fade back
into statistical insignificance once I reach the outskirts of
Duluth. Although culturally lean, the Zenith of the Unsalted Sea has
always been a back-to-normal-people mini-vacation for me.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Troll-baiting? I fully understand that all of these Jimmy Billy Jack
London Thudpucker She Ran Calling Wildfire types are simply after some
authenticity, some truth, purity, simplicity, innocence, some modicum
of reality in their lives, and, yes, I suppose it&rsquo;s all good on some
level to try some new tunnel&rsquo;s escapism promises. But really, how did
I, someone wanting, doing basically the same things, get so jaded and anti
towards all my fellow North Shore invasives? Why am I so out of sync
with their particular version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottagecore">Cottagecore</a> hyperreality?<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.5738824' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.5738824' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
Also consider Theo Adorno&rsquo;s (Frankfurt School) theory of
<i>pseudo-individualism</i>, i.e., the mass illusion created by modern
advertising and marketing that by owning a certain set of what are
still just standardized and mass-manufactured products you become
unique, smart, daring, fun and exciting, ahead of the pack
<i>individual</i>&#x2026;
</span> I
blame Europe and my almost ten years there, specifically Germany and
Switzerland. For it was in Europe that I became exposed (indoctrinated
in-) to the Old World way of thinking and being.
</p>

<p>
As I&rsquo;ve explained elsewhere, Europe, the Old World, the Eastern
Hemisphere in general, is working with <i>four</i> dimensions, while New
World Americans only with the three dimensions of standard physical
space. The fourth dimension is of course time, but in a
social-cultural sense <i>time as history</i> &#x2026; which is necessary in
order to have any sort of <i>real</i> rooted culture. Americans, lacking
history and real rootedness, are like children fighting to dominate
the ever-changing Zeitgeist, an endless game of King of the Hill won
by those with progressively less and less actual value or merit. That
is to say, we&rsquo;re just kaleidoscoping churn, with nary anything of real
or last value coming forth. As a German once said to me, You Americans
are trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle missing half the pieces and
no box lid to know what it&rsquo;s supposed to look like; and so you just
cut and glue and tape some abstraction together, then fight over whose
is the right picture. Indeed, such were the broadsides I took while
trying to play the Jimmy Steward aw-shucks American Boy over there&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Alas, but I&rsquo;m the American who got <i>verdeutscht</i><label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.9481302' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.9481302' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
&#x2026; <i>germanized</i>, but with the derogatory, negative <i>ver-</i>
prefix, e.g., Luther called his Bible a <i>Verdeutschung</i> from the
original Catholic Latin Bible.
</span> and now can&rsquo;t
resettle back in my land of origin, hard as I&rsquo;ve tried.<label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.2232248' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.2232248' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
Yes, I should have stayed! But A) they don&rsquo;t just hand out
citizenship to anyone, assimilated as I was or no, and B) a busted
engagement put me in an irrational state of mind, which had me
scurrying brokenhearted back home. Alas&#x2026;
</span> Germany
especially was my Hogwarts where I was sorted into the Ravenclaw
House, i.e., the intellectuals. And ever since it has been this
strange Euro-instilled <i>noblesse oblige</i> driving me to keep learning,
keep exploring and growing intellectually&#x2014;which puts me increasingly
at odds with the Kumbaya singers, the ex-suburbanites who have
reinvented themselves as these rugged outdoors types who cannot, will
not ever be caught sounding intellectual. Here an odd sort of unspoken
anti-intellectual brain-shaming, reverse discrimination is <i>de
rigueur</i>. Apparently it&rsquo;s hip to play the ignorant peasant.

<h3 id="org0043671">Yet another <i>Halloweenus interruptus</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org0043671">
<p>
Being ruled by my Dark Muse, being darkly-inclined, Halloween is my
premiere, dare I say <i>sacred</i> holiday. But once again I was stuck with
The Flannel Shirt People who simply don&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t get Halloween, some
of whom intentionally, actively work against it. I&rsquo;m saying this burg
is ruled by Halloween shunners, Samhain Eve putzes. But what really
depressed me was the screening of the original <i>Beetlejuice</i> by the
Grand Marais Film Society on the 25th of October. Here was to be the
only visible, outwardly public acknowledgement of Halloween&#x2014;besides
the trick-or-treating where helicopter parents hover nervously around
their children in the afternoon! (Can&rsquo;t risk darkness.) Read on.
</p>

<p>
I arrived that night at the ACA<label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.6442931' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.6442931' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
<i>Arrowhead Center for the Arts</i> located on the ISD 166
schoolgrounds.
</span> auditorium to an almost full
house. Promising. But I noticed it was all the usual flannel-shirted
suspects. Then to my horror they played <a href="https://youtu.be/pyQJe6vH73M?si=9eXWyUXVskqKMdvU">this video</a> from the local
singing group <i>Basalta</i> as a preview. Suffice it to say there could
not have been a more opposite vibe to <i>Beetlejuice</i> and the general
gothy Halloween spirit than this next-gen sucky folksinging. These
were Millennial women with their strong take-no-prisoners Feminism 2.0
vibe poking me in the eyes with sticks <i>and</i> singing their
overwrought, sappy folk. Apparently Boomers have not cornered the
campfire Kumbaya market&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
But then I have history with this community&rsquo;s treatment of
Halloween. Our very first Halloween back in 2008 was a sober awakening
to the anti-Dark attitude when the wife and I tried to put on a dark
&ldquo;Halloween Poetry Reading&rdquo; at the Art Colony&rsquo;s old church space. We
distributed fliers featuring the brilliant Paulia Cassidy&rsquo;s gothy art
inviting the community to snacks and gothic, Halloween-themed, Poesque
poetry and music.
</p>

<a href="https://www.paulinafae.com/" target="_blank"><img src="./images/PaulinaFaeMyCrowd.png" width="800" alt="Paulina Fae My Crowd"></a>
<span class="cap">Paulina Cassidy's My Crowd</span>

<p>
But the town just wasn&rsquo;t having it. Long short, only a few
people&#x2014;mainly kids, i.e., trick-or-treaters come for the
snacks&#x2014;trickled in throughout the evening. We had advertised the
event as open mic as well. But when anyone did &ldquo;contribute&rdquo; it seemed
intentionally, stick-in-the-eye contrarian to our gothy dark
theme. For example, one individual just had to read sundry
North-woodsy poems (mainly Robert Service) <i>completely</i> unrelated to
Halloween. As you can imagine, we came away shocked and defeated. We
also heard that the main bar in town always features a Reggae band for
Halloween, intentionally aiming to counter the dreary-gloomy darkening
seasonality with happy, cheery, uplifting, let&rsquo;s imagine we&rsquo;re
vacationing in sunny Jamaica spirits! Alas, what sort of people must
needs <i>hate</i> and <i>cancel</i> Halloween so? These intellectually
emotionally minimalist North Shorers, that&rsquo;s who&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
And so the lights dimmed and <i>Beetlejuice</i> began&#x2014;and I slowly got
the indescribable feeling that I was the only person in that
three-hundred-plus audience who was getting, enjoying it.<label id='fnr.8' for='fnr-in.8.852288' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.8.852288' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup>
The feeling was similar to Laibach&rsquo;s reception in North
Korea. See <a href="https://youtu.be/SQORt5Y7Eqo?si=3ewtoN9iTTnZsNSe">this</a>.
</span> Of
course I&rsquo;d seen it many times, but as the end came round I was the
only one stirring. In other words, nobody else had ever seen it&#x2014;and
had no idea it was about to end. I left during the credits&#x2014;as did a
woman dressed &ldquo;office goth.&rdquo; We chatted a bit in the parking lot&#x2014;she
was just visiting from the Cities&#x2014;and I left too devastated to see
straight. A sinusoidal blind fury/deep depression set in and made me
despondent for the next few days. But what to do? Stay and fight or
pack and leave? As I&rsquo;ve said before, this place, this Arrowhead region
is so perfect darkly-speaking.

<h3 id="org79c4fb7">The Sutter Brothers&rsquo; performance</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org79c4fb7">
<p>
And then came the Sutter Brothers&rsquo; performance. The audience at the
Grand Marais Public Library on that November 8 Friday afternoon
numbered north of fifty, south of a hundred, nearly all Boomers like
me, the DNA visibly skewed Scandihoovian, and, my knowing at least a
third of them, people who would have partied with Fred Rogers and
bristled at Saturday Night Live&rsquo;s mocking sketches of him. Here were
the Harris-Walz voters, <i>A Prairie Home Companion</i> devotees, students,
supporters of <a href="https://northhouse.org/">North House Folk School</a>, marchers under the Rainbow
Flag, attendees of all sorts of &ldquo;workshops&rdquo; on New Age esoterica,
again, the &ldquo;usual suspects.&rdquo; The predominant psych marker was this
unique Minnesotan take on Freudian emotional immaturity. These were
the people for whom childhood trips up the Shore mustn&rsquo;t ever
end. Here was just another reliving of the campfire in the deep woods
singing about Michael rowing his boat ashore. But how dare I rain on
their parade?  After all, this is their bailiwick. I&rsquo;m the odd-man-out
here&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Musician Ross began with an actual children&rsquo;s campfire song, then came
a Bill Staines song. The goth in me cringed spastically, Bill Staines
of course being the antidote to the dark sarcasm and nihilistic
cynicism of John Denver. But legion were the people who ate up Bill
Staines, who never understood that the film <i>A Mighty Wind</i> <label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.1471703' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.1471703' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mighty_Wind">A Mighty Wind</a></i> was made by the same people who made <i>This is
Spinal Tap</i> and intended as a &ldquo;mockumentary.&rdquo;
</span> was
mocking them and their overwrought, saccharine sucky folk and the
particular het up milieu behind it.
</p>

<p>
What touches us emotionally? Whither sentimentalism? And why is one
man&rsquo;s sentimentality another&rsquo;s mawkish kitsch? Reaching into our
gentler core, sharing such matters of the heart is fraught. The main
problem is vulnerability and triggering defensive responses. We have a
logic train which we errantly assume is dominant, but then an emotion
braid which reach far into the past where it can be hopelessly frayed
and tangled up. I&rsquo;ve heard that Garrison Keillor can be short if not
irascible whenever an East Coast city-slicker sneers or casts
aspersions on his Northern Midwest shtick. Indeed, it&rsquo;s all good until
somebody is clearly not playing along, paying proper homage. And then
out come the knives, and the reprobate is driven off as if he were a
blasé Roman Catholic discovered at the frenzied peak of a Southern
Baptist tent revival.

One inner sanctum comparison might be with my parents who were born
in 1935,<label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.9670868' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.9670868' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
A strange generation, sometimes called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Generation">Silent Generation</a>,
that came between The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_Generation">Greatest Generation</a> (people born between 1901
to 1927) and the Baby Boomers (1945 - 1960). They were a sort of
second &ldquo;Lost Generation&rdquo; that exhibited dominant &ldquo;old soul&rdquo;
traits. Think Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard&rsquo;s melancholic
characters in <i>Breakfast at Tiffany&rsquo;s,</i> the generation&rsquo;s theme songs
<i>Moon River,</i> <i>The Shadow of Your Smile,</i> and then of course <i>The Girl
From Ipanema</i> as sung by one of their leading old soul mascots Astrud
Gilberto.
</span> college-educated (Washington University, St. Louis),
vaguely intellectual. They lived in tumultuous, ever-changing times,
but their generation&rsquo;s penetralium was soft and gentle and
compassionate&#x2014;all while being very grownup and ultimately fatalistic
&#x2026; as if old souls who had come this way many times before and
experienced only tragedy. Indeed, they came and went oh so
fatalistically, almost unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
Not us Boomers! Loud, brash, trouble-making, facile, feckless &ldquo;new
souls&rdquo; as we were. We talked big, delivered little. Our &ldquo;rock stars&rdquo;
sang embarrassingly silly lyrics, tore up hotels, and smashed guitars
on stage.<label id='fnr.11' for='fnr-in.11.8101394' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.11.8101394' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>11</sup>
Seriously, can you imagine GenXer Tracy Chapman smashing her
acoustic guitar?
</span> But now middle-aged and older we feel the
need to finally begin sorting out, laying claim to some manner of
adulthood&#x2014;if it&rsquo;s not too painful and troublesome.
</p>

<p>
What do Bart Sutter, Sigurd Olson, and Sam Cook all have in common? I
might begin by saying they all lay out an impressionistic but
strangely noncommittal vagueness in their written musings. As if you
must have one foot in some hazy Northern European <i>peasant</i> past and
the other in our always tightly circumscribed, played-down American
college-educated caste. As if nobody dare step up and actually say
anything consequential lest it sound too intellectual, lest some
paragraph of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_Jante">Jantelagen</a></i> be violated. And so up float shiny soap
bubbles that must never drift above a cultural-intellectual ceiling
only coming up to the knee. Was East Germany this repressed,
repressive?
</p>

<p>
This might be explained as yet another exit taken to escape our
dominant modern urban-intellectual cult of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism">literary realism</a>. I mean
the later realism where Faulkner, Nabokov, Samuel Beckett deal in
protagonists who mainly just savage one another emotionally
spiritually, spiraling down into a nihilistic void. And yet when I
read Sutter&rsquo;s poetry or non-fiction (<i>Cold Comfort</i>) I can&rsquo;t help but
get a <i>Mod-real Lite®</i> vibe. He still wants to hint at existential
meaningless&#x2014;in order to fit in with the general modern trend? Don&rsquo;t
beseech or preach, mind your Jante Ps and Qs, i.e., keep everything at
the Scandi-peasant level, and all will be fine.
</p>

<p>
Contrast any of the &ldquo;nature-themed&rdquo; writings of the above-mentioned
with the Romantic Era poets such as the Brontë Sisters or
Wordsworth. I might even claim Romanticism was a new Northern European
nature paganism. But when I read our local guys, I never feel like the
North Woods is anything but vaguely &ldquo;inspirational,&rdquo; always this big
force majeure thingy but held maddening anti-sublime. I don&rsquo;t mean to
say this is not interesting writing, for how else could one be so
Minnesotan formulaic conformist except with great skill?  They have

<p>
Why do America&rsquo;s supposedly creative people fear beauty, forever
shunning and dancing around it? Why must their artistic output so
often have that obligatory whiff of pee, cow shit? Why is openly
expressing profundity like farting loudly at Thanksgiving dinner? Why
is watery peasant kitchen philosophy all we dare share? This Northern
audience likes its cheesy, schmaltzy folk music, but then its
protagonists must be grimy, low-word-count dullards and
simpletons&#x2014;always this low-rent, proletariat version of the Byronic
hero. The intentionality, the necessity of this subculture, again,
feels almost dark-day Stalinist.

As I understand, modern-day Old World Scandinavian social scientists

hangover, i.e., that here is a Lutheranism long since faded away from
the Scandinavian homelands. Meaning here are yet strong echoes of that

One of the sadder things about my time in Scandi Minnesota has been
watching any sort of Scandihoovian roots efforts see tepid reactions,
at best flounder.

<p>
Here is no real culture? Curiously, I have found the stray soul of
Scandi descent who has tried, largely unsuccessfully to make
connections with the homeland. Here in Grand Marais we have a woman
who has tried to whip up interest in all things Swedish. There are a
handful of people who can speak some language. But it&rsquo;s dying out. The
high water mark was probably the Nordic Roots Festival at the Cedar
Cultural Center in Minneapolis, the last year being 2008.

America &#x2026; this great continent-wide land initially colonized by
Euro-peasants &#x2026; forever doomed to arrested, stunted culture
formation &#x2026; held back by peasantisms never to be overcome
&#x2026;. doomed to an eternal, Sisyphean <i>cultura interruptus</i>. Alas&#x2026;

I suppose what annoyed me the most about Poling and Michell&rsquo;s <i>Jack &amp;
the Ghost</i> is, once again, it dared not be too, what?, cultivated,
erudite, highbrow literati. It presents itself as a gothic tragedy, a
Lake Superior version of, say, Theodor Storm&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rider_on_the_White_Horse">Schimmelreiter</a></i>,<label id='fnr.14' for='fnr-in.14.3252421' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.14.3252421' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup>

Very gritty, grimy mod-real book by the modern Japanese
Neo-Nietzschean writer Yukio Mishima, then made into a film in 1976.
</span> but immediately
cuts expectations by presenting itself as a quasi-children&rsquo;s picture
book with Mitchell&rsquo;s faux naïve art. The main protagonist is a
fisherman named Jack. As the pages turn, we never get the impression
that Jack has much mental or emotional maturity beyond a
grade-schooler. Jack, seemingly a simpleton, has lost his fiancee in a
storm on what is called (lower-case) &ldquo;the great lake,&rdquo; thus Lake
Superior, before the village of Greyshore (British English spelling
grey), which must be Grand Marais. And yet the creators have
redesigned/rebuilt Greyshore/Grand Marais as Hawthorne&rsquo;s Salem or
Lovecraft&rsquo;s Marblehead Massachusetts with crowded-together
eighteenth-century clapboard buildings and cobblestone streets,
certainly nothing like the real Grand Marais&#x2026;

There was a time in film when men and women were portrayed by&#x2014;men
and women, i.e., grownups. Then came the era of dumbed-down persona,
e.g., the eternal pretty high school boy look of Beau Bridges, Brad
Pitt, and Tom Cruise. When we see Sarah Miles (below) in <i>The Sailor
Who Fell from Grace with the Sea</i> we know we are looking at a grown
woman of some class and breeding&#x2014;which is of course eschewed by so
many today.

My Kansas Mennonite wife and I came to Duluth back in 2003, moved up
the shore to Knife River, finally landing in Grand Marais
in 2007. Disappointment, disenchantment grew, however, and in 2014 she
just had to get back to her people. And so we packed up and headed to
Northern Indiana where the Anabaptists are dominant and she could
attend a Mennonite seminary.

<p>
Why Jack must be a peasant fisherman while Richard Burton and
Elizabeth Taylor&rsquo;s characters in <i>The Sandpiper</i> are denizens of the
day&rsquo;s general culture.

This particular Minnesotan Scandihoovian subculture.
