Allow me to repeat my statement
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
This site will explore the mysterious allure of the Inland Sea, which
may lie close to what some of the poets of the nineteenth century, the
<i>Romanticists</i>, were on about.
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
and explain what I mean&#x2026;
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga5140fd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga5140fd">Why have you renamed Lake Superior to <i>The Inland Sea</i>?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga5140fd">
<p>
Simply put, it's too big and grand and epic and sublime a body of
water to just be a lake.  For me a lake is something that can be
looked across, from one shore to the far shore. Or maybe at only a few
widest places can I not see to the other side.
</p>

<p>
Really now, do you think the world's largest body of fresh water
surface-wise (31,700 square miles)&#x2014;bigger than lots of bodies called
seas, for example, the Aral Sea, the Dead Sea, the Sea of Galilee, the
Salton Sea&#x2014;is just a lake? I don't. I think it's definitely a
<i>sea</i>. The Ojibwa name <i>gichi-gami</i> means "great sea." The French
explorers came up with the name <i>le lac supérieur</i>, and they meant the
"upper lake" above Lake Huron. This was anglicised to Lake Superior. A
comedy of geographic-cartographic errors, I'd say.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps <i>Inland Sea</i> is vague; there are other bodies of water around
the world referred to as such. As a book title, James Fenimore Cooper
called Lake Ontario the Inland Sea. And with <i>Operation Inland Seas</i>
the U.S. Navy referred to <i>all</i> of the Great Lakes as the inland seas
when, upon its completion in 1959, they sent a flotilla up the
St. Lawrence Seaway. But vague is good. It means we're being local and
<i>vernacular</i>, <i>provincial</i>, if not <i>parochial</i> about our sea. Let them
deal with us.
</p>

<p>
One ulterior motive is to raise a sense of majesty and mystery in a
poetic sense. Saying Inland Sea or The Inland Sea is a bit like saying
<i>world</i> or <i>globe</i> instead of <i>planet</i>. Evocative. Alluring. Inland
Sea then begs renaming <i>North Shore</i> to <i>North Coast</i>. Done.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1cf0d37">
<p>
One main difference between indoors and outdoors is that outdoors
often has a naturally-occurring breeze or <b>wind</b>. And if the wind is
up as it can be up here on the North Coast of the Inland Sea, then we
have <i>wuthering</i>.<label for="1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="1" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">

Emily Jane Brontë </span> Though it is ironic that my
favourite poet, <b>Emily Jane Brontë</b>, wrote the novel <i><b>Wuthering</b>
Heights</i>, which I have not read. My former wife read it and did not

<div id="outline-container-orgd945c43" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd945c43">Why would you connect this place with Romanticism?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd945c43">
<p>
To be sure, insisting this unique place of sea and land is something
other than how the prevailing image influencers and tourist brochures
are painting it will certainly ruffle some feathers. I presuppose
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I know what Romanticism is, and,</li>
<li>symbolism, image, narrative, mythology are fungible.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Let me address number two first. At least for me, this landscape of
wilderness and water is distinctive to the point of defying
description, definition, labels of any sort. Occupied permanently only
<i>post</i>-Columbian by the Ojibwa people, soon thereafter joined by
French traders, finally settled by mainly Scandinavian immigrants,
this North Coast of the Inland Sea has not seen permanent human
habitation long enough to be contained by any one narrative or
mythology. But since the 1970s when my Boomer generation began
arriving from urban-suburban places like the Twin Cities and Chicago,
parallel to the steady replacement of the mining and timber industries
with tourism, there has been something of a consensus formed around
the idea that we are a <i>lost, discontiguous county of Alaska</i>. This is
what I jokingly call <b>Neo-Klondikism</b>.
</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iKY5NC2pgio" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
The Neo-Klondike backwoods northern frontier <i>anti</i>-aesthetic would
have us wearing flannel shirts, woolen pants with a sheathed knife on
a leather belt, and lumberjack hobnail-derivative boots&#x2014;exchanged
for Steger mukluks in the winter. The official narrators are Jack
London and Robert Service&#x2014;with non-boreal Ernest Hemingway as an
honorary bard<label for="2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="2" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
This would exclude Sigurd F. Olson (1899 – 1982) an true
long-time Arrowhead bard, but who was decidedly Scandinavian
impressionistic in the spirit of Robert Frost. Boomer buy-in for
Sigurd was minimal.
</span>. Our official TV shows are <i>Northern Exposure</i> and
especially <i>The Red Green Show</i>. The official music is anything
twangy. Banjos? Never enough of them.
</p>

<p>
And yet Neo-Klondike is completely divorced from anything Ojibwa,
French, or Scandinavian. Especially this last group. Despite having so
many people of Scandinavian descent here on the North Coast,
Neo-Klondike is a total about-face from Scandinavia, an ancestral
parallel world with a long tradition of just this sort of humans
embedded deep in boreal forest narrative mythology. Granted, if you
peruse the children's books at the Duluth Public Library you will find
a full selection of Scandinavia-based picture books from Elsa Beskow,
Astrid Lundgren, Sibylle von Olfers, Selma Lagerlöf, Hans Christian
Andersen, and John Bauer, supported by Germanic-British narrative
mythology from Tolkien, Arthur Rackam, to name just a few. And yes, we
have the <i>North House Folk School</i>, a supposed cultural vestige from
Scandinavia. But you won't hear Swedish folk bands Väsen or Garmarna,
or cow-calling (<i>kulning</i>) or hardanger fiddle at any of the Folk
School's major musical events; just a lot of imported twang.

\(\mathfrak{Fazit}\)<label for="3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="3" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<b>Fazit</b> is a Latin-derived German word meaning, <i>bottom line</i>,
<i>in conclusion</i>.
</span>: For anything of Scandinavian mythology, for any
sort of Lindgren's <i>Bullerby</i> you'll find only the faintest echoes on
today's North Coast.

<h3 id="orgb54d5ed">Do we really need another reimagining, rebranding?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb54d5ed">
<p>
There would seem to be two general types of relocators to the North
Coast&#x2014;well-off retirees who want a quiet, picturesque place for
their dessert years, and those people wanting to get away from
somewhere less desirable and restart their lives. With this second
group <b>authenticity</b> is a big motivator.
</p>

<p>
So many of us grew up in sterile, conformist, cookie-cutter
urban-suburban landscapes very short on nature and flogging a
high-pressure over-achieving materialist lifestyle. But as adults we
set out searching for something, somewhere more real and
authentic. And so we made this big jump out of the middle- and
upper-middle-class to be far from the madding crowds<label for="4" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="4" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Another set of leapers would be they who jumped from suburb
into hip, trendy urban scenes, often derided as "vapid urban
hipsters." But can there also be "vapid <i>rural</i> hipsters?"
</span>.
</p>

<p>
I mean to be amusing with my stereotyping of Neo-Klondike. And what I
mean WUTHERING to be will probably <i>not</i> appeal to the
dyed-in-the-Filson-wool Neo-Klondiker, amused or no. If you are a
full-purchase Neo-Klondiker you've found your haven, your
hermitage. You've gone through your rebirth/rebranding and this little
corner of pretend Alaska is exactly that 180-degrees opposite to your
suburban clone-bunny past that you were looking for. But it's just not
for me. Even though I too grew up in white upper-middle-class suburban
America, I can't buy into Neo-Klondike<label for="5" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="5" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Blame it on my seven years in Germany and Switzerland where I
was exposed to a halfway functioning society with real history and
culture. After that you just can't sell me American subculture and
lifestyles.
</span>. At this point I only
mean WUTHERING to be a second opinion, not a serious competitor. I
don't mean this to be "authenticity wars." And it probably won't,
because no matter how persuasive and illuminating I may wax, I'm sure
the majority of you will not be convinced to part with your bit parts
in our Paul Bunyanesque drama<label for="6" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="6" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Please don't overreact to my sentence fragments and other
middle-school English transgressions. The Early German Romanticism was
big on "fragments."

to see if anyone else is having similar thoughts and doubts.

<h3 id="orgea4363e">So if you're not with the program why did you come here in the first place&#x2014;why did you stay?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgea4363e">
<p>
In 2003, Kristine, my wife at the time, our twin boys, and I came up
to the North Coast from Kristine's home in Kansas. We had been good
earners in the Matrix&#x2014;I programming, she management; but we had
become disillusioned with the rat-race and were casting about for some
sort of anti-bourgeois, back-to-the-land alternative. This region
seemed just the spot with its population of alternative-thinking
back-to-the-land people. But as we settled in and time marched on, we
realised we were not really meant for this endless episode of <i>The Red
Green Show</i> after all, where college-educated people wore Carhartt and
Wintergreen and seemed to be dumbing down conversations as if worried
invisible Alaskan trappers standing close by would be offended by
"fancy talk."
</p>

<p>
As I now realise, Kristine had given up much earlier than I. For
example, every night before bed she would read from her complete
edition of Jane Austen, a big door stop of a book. She would read it
cover-to-cover, then start over again. And of course she was
Mennonite, a curious Protestant sect with similar social-psychology to
the Mormons, that is, insular, self-contained, not really looking for
alternative lifestyles. Kristine's head really wasn't in it&#x2014;and as I
later found out (the hard way), it never really was.
</p>

<p>
And so as the years of sitting on the fence dragged on, this and that
idea couldn't reach consensus, and our boys grew up<label for="7" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="7" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Karl and Klaus attended Great Expectations grades 1 through 8.
</span>, I had
increasingly many moments of "oh fecal matter" when I realised that I
just could not vibrate on this quasi-hillbilly with Hemingway
sprinkles wavelength. At some point we had both reached full
disillusionment mode, and yet we were stuck, having abandoned our
yuppie careers but with no interest in making some go of it in this
tourist-hustle economy. Eventually, Kristine decided to become a
Mennonite pastor, and so in 2014 we relocated to the Mennonite
heartland of Northern Indiana. There our marriage finally hit the
rocks, such an iconoclast as I never a good match for her Mennonite
world, let alone as a Mennonite pastor's spouse.
</p>

<p>
But one shared thing was our love of English and German culture,
especially that of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. It had
become escapism from North Coast escapism.

<h3 id="org5c7099c">Again, how is some 19th-century Romanticism template overlay supposed to be better than Neo-Klondike?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5c7099c">
<p>
A very simple and direct (if not shocking) answer is because I (and
probably you) are of Northwestern European descent<label for="8" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="8" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
According to AncestryDNA I'm Scottish, English, German, and
Swedish, although the Swedish is probably a "false positive" as my
German ancestors fled religious persecution to Protestant Sweden in
the sixteenth century. <i>Nortwestern</i> would mean those of Celtic and/or
Germanic origins.
</span>, and what
many of the poets and visionary people thrown together under the
rubric <i>Romanticsim</i> were going after was a nature-based spirituality
specifically for Northwestern Europe. Strangely enough this would
combine three distinctive poles
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>dark, mysterious, melancholic, gothy<label for="9" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="9" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
The modern meaning of <i>goth</i> is really more about Dark Romantic
and not gothic per se. I mean to keep <i>goth</i> separate from <i>gothic</i>,
which is a horror/melodrama genre. However most "experts" typically
don't grasp this nuance&#x2026;
</span> things;</li>
<li>European pagan bits and pieces;</li>
<li>a more "poetic," less "imperative" take on Christianity</li>
</ol>

<p>
&#x2014;all of this embedded in <b>Nature</b> (capitalised). And so I feel in my
<i>folk-soul</i>, in my genetic memory&#x2014;as tribal, identitarian, and
unpolitically correct as that may seem&#x2014;the briefest glimpses of
something <i>beyond</i>, something <i>sublime</i><label for="10" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="10" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Lots more about <i>sublime</i> later where I wrest it away from the
clueless academes. I'm using <b>academe</b> in the derogatory sense as a
pedantic scholar who may analyse the individual trees very well but
can't see the forest.
</span> when I read my Romantic
Era poets. And most importantly, it would seem to apply perfectly to
this North Coast setting.
</p>

<p>
Short story: During my misspent youth (which, by the way, just wrapped
up a few weeks ago), I once tried to join a back-to-nature commune in
Wisconsin where everyone was white like me but pretending to be Native
American. I'd always been a great admirer of the Native American
nature-based belief system and initially thought this was very
cool. But at some point it became obvious that I was witnessing just
another bone-headed example of <i>cultural appropriation</i>. Something a
Dakota man at the Pine Ridge Reservation once said to me came back,
"You're like stray dogs hanging around the village." He meant whites
trying to be native. Obviously, he wasn't buying into "we're all just
mix-and-match" multiculturalism.
</p>

<p>
I had also explored proto-European spiritual movements; but so many
seemed just too marginal-kooky, out to completely over-the-top
Nazi. Trying to keep the hippie, earth-pagan Odinists separate from
the far-Right skinhead Odinists was just too problematic. And then of
course various Eastern dabbling. But Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism
just seemed like the stray dog problem anew. My destiny was not
grafting onto somebody else's culture or ways.
</p>

<p>
One of my first "roots" experiences was back in the Army, circa 1975,
when I was stationed in Germany deep in the Bavarian-Bohemian
Forest. There I read <i>Lord of the Rings</i>, which resonated in that
Bavarian version of the Shire very powerfully. I lived with a local
family just below a haunted castle ruins. My landlady believed in
ghosts and witches, and her son-in-law swore he and his brother had
once found dwarf tunnels<label for="11" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="11" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
German Romanticism can be very alternate-universe eerie. We
will eventually get to Tieck and Hoffmann, who were very
gothy-otherworldly.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
At some point I started reading the poetry of <b>Emily Brontë</b>, then
others of her era. Slowly but surely it began to sink in that the
late-eighteenth-, early-nineteenth-century poets of
Romanticism&#x2014;mainly English and German&#x2014; were <i>finally</i> getting
around to something real, reaching into that nexus of "Nature dreaming
us dreaming Nature"<label for="12" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="12" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Nature dreaming us, we dreaming Nature as two sides of the same
coin is a big theme in my upcoming novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i>. Much
later.
</span> that I had found back in the 1970s reading,
for example, T.C. McLuhan's <i>Touch the Earth</i>, a collection of Native
American wise sayings. Emily et al. were saying virtually the same
thing!
</p>

<p>
And so my conclusion was to stop chasing after gurus and shamans and
wise-people from other cultures and races, to stop lifestyle
mix-and-match and to simply rediscover my own people at their best
moments. The early nineteen century of England and Germany was
something I, a seeker from the late-twentieth-century suburbs, could finally call authentic.
</p>

<p>
The immediate answer to this is that it's not easy. Our real
wise-men/women, our real gurus and shamans were people like the
Haworth and Amherst Emilies, now buried and largely forgotten. And
whenever they are unearthed they're routinely misunderstood and
misrepresented by so many of our latter-day agenda-pushers and
clueless academes<label for="13" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="13" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
One prime example would be the bizarrely anachronistic AppleTV
series <i>Dickinson</i> where Emily Dickinson is portrayed as a
unmistakeably contemporary rebel princess who has decided she's
lesbian.
</span>.
</p>

<p>
Our candidates for wise-people showed us novices no easy
path. Exhibit-A of the thorny, rocky road to "Northwestern
enlightenment" would be Haworth Emily who died at age twenty-nine from
what was thought to be anorexia and tuberculosis&#x2014;probably even more
exacerbated by Haworth's unsafe drinking water. Here's a passage from
my book <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i><label for="14" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="14" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
<i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> is about Lady Emily Whitmore, a
nineteen-year-old English earl's daughter and her best friend Annette
<i>Freiin</i> von der Surwitz, a German baron's daughter. They are
desperately trying to figure out their roles as peers, their <i>noblesse
oblige</i> in modern times.
</span>
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
She [Emily Whitmore] went back to the window, set the book [collected
poems of Emily Brontë] in the stone well [of the window], and read
[the poem] <b>Stars</b> again. How nutritionally deficient was her body
when she wrote it? How cold was the room? How hopeless were her
suppressed needs? How fraught was her life?
</p>

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Later, Emily
</p>

<p>
No, the Brontë sisters would never appear on the cover of a New
Age Buddhist magazine at the Amazon Whole Foods checkout. That's why
so much of Haworth Emily's lines are so full of anguish and
lament. Here's the last stanzas of her <i>Song</i><label for="15" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="15" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
One of the Brontës' many remembrance poems for their dead
mother and older sisters Maria and Elizabeth.
</span>
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
&#x2026;let them fight for honour’s breath,<br />
Or pleasure’s shade pursue&#x2014;<br />
The dweller in the land of death<br />
Is changed and careless too.<br />
<br />
And, if their eyes should watch and weep<br />
Till sorrow’s source were dry,<br />
She would not, in her tranquil sleep,<br />
Return a single sigh!<br />
<br />
Blow, west-wind, by the lonely mound,<br />
And murmur, summer-streams&#x2014;<br />
There is no need of other sound<br />
To soothe my lady’s dreams.<br />

</blockquote></div>

<p>
Morbidly melancholic? A grave-envy fixation on death? How can she be
your messiah? Because I envy a state where the west wind and the
murmuring stream are all I have, all I need to sooth my dreams, I
guess.
</p>

<p>
And so I've touched upon 1) the gothy Dark Romantic, and I promise to
come back to 2) and 3), the pagan and the Christian.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org9b8d9dc" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9b8d9dc">Are you saying Neo-Klondike is bogus?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org9b8d9dc">
<p>
Pretty much so, yes. Let's first back <i>way</i> up to answer this, to
trace Neo-Klondike's roots. Literature&#x2014;or should I say it's
gatekeepers&#x2014;abandoned ephemeral, intractable
Romanticism&#x2014;early. Even in Edgar Allan Poe's times, publishers were
"through" with Romanticism/Dark Romanticism. But Poe would sneak
around them and manage to get his blockbusters published in this
newspaper, that magazine. <i>The Raven</i>, for example, went
viral&#x2014;especially in Europe<label for="16" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="16" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Baudelaire was particularly evangelical in France.
</span>. As did <i>Annabel Lee</i>. As of
course his gothic crime and horror stories.
</p>

<p>
Especially throughout the later half of the Nineteenth, the
gatekeepers were eager to move on to what became known as <i>modern
realism</i>. Henrik Ibsen was one of their initial champions. For
example, his play <i>An Enemy of the People</i> offered exactly what
realism advocates wanted, i.e., a real, honest assessments of society,
plot lines uncovering our ills, mistakes, cover-ups, <i>hypocrisies</i>.
</p>

<p>
However, this exposé era of mod-real was short, as Ibsen himself
shifted all at once from truth-seeking critiques such as <i>A Doll's
House</i> to the more nihilistic <i>Hedda Gabler</i>. In <i>Hedda&#x2026;</i>, the
characters are <i>not</i> truth-seeking wrong-righters like the doctor in
<i>An Enemy&#x2026;</i>, rather, just a pack of over-socialised bourgeois salon
lions savaging one another&#x2014;for no better motives than boredom and
"dark Freudianisms," as one critic posited. And so modern realism
descended &#x2026; into nihilist existential meaninglessness, into
obviation of right and wrong, into God-scoffing, away from old souls
out in Nature and into new souls scrapping indoors. A Romantic Era
line such as
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
Mellan Guds skapelse och Kristi medkänsla kommer du att finna din
lycka. <br />
Between God’s creation and Christ’s compassion there you will find
your bliss.

&#x2026;most of whom are actually Romanticism haters, e.g.,
modernists. Imagine reading a review of a Baroque concert written by a

very important about Romanticism, namely, that what the academes were
saying and what I was getting from just reading the poems and looking
at the art were two completely different animals. I've become very

their times and influences<label for="18" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="18" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
All too often the modern academe invents, projects, imagines

A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving in
a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore, but to be in the lake,

the soul to accept mystery.

Right. The point is not to analyse to death each and every tree, but
to take in the deepest realisation possible of the forest as a
whole. Never before did poetry reach so far into the whole, into the

The Brontë sisters hardly ever left the Yorkshire village of

Earth beseeching the human to &#x2026; <i>come back and dwell with me</i>

<p>
Yes, yes, the irony of introspective, contemplative nature-based
Wordsworthian-Brontëan poetry coming out of Britain's most
imperialistic, Manifest Destiny times is schizophrenic for
certain. And no, I don't think many "got it," much less could really
do much with it back then. And yet Romantic aesthetics has come

I can say definitively they were a few shades more "real" than we
clone-bunny suburbanites are. Here's some dialogue from my not really
published book <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i>. In this scene Annette is visiting the
Whitmore's Wolkeld estate, the two girls walking the lane up to the
neglected manor house Wolkeld Hall, talking about <i>Jane Eyre</i> and her
existence with the Rivers family as a school marm
</p>

<div class="epigraph"><blockquote>
<p>
“No, no, of course not.” Emily groaned and shook her hands in
frustration. “I know it sounds mad, but I want that life.”
</p>

<p>
“What life?”
</p>

<p>
“Why, Jane Eyre’s! At least the one she had with the Rivers family.”
Emily stopped and looked up into the oak limbs. “I know I didn’t
explain it very well, but that was the life, the church I was
imagining.”
</p>

<p>
Annette jumped a pace ahead, wheeled around, and, shaking her index
finger admonishingly, exclaimed, “Well, you can’t have it!”
</p>

<p>
Emily laughed brightly at her friend’s petulant theatrics.
</p>

<p>
“What?!” exclaimed Annette, joining in the laughter. “Is it my
accent?”
</p>

<p>
“No, Annette, no. It’s just how you said that.”	
</p>

<p>
Emily straightened up, took a breath, and began walking again. Annette
fell in beside her. “No, really, imagine being a school teacher back
then in that country parish. Earning a pittance. Living in a stone
cottage. All around is a Yorkshire semi-wilderness. And nowhere on the
planet is anything even vaguely modern, nothing that could save a
person from an infected—toe.”
</p>

<p>
“Harsh,” said Annette, “harsh, but I suppose thrilling for it. And it
was exactly that harshness, those real boundaries and limits that
elicited the beauty.”
</p>

<p>
“Would you go back if you could? If there were a time machine, would
you go back?”
</p>

<p>
The tall German threw her head back and forced her chest out. After a
big inhale-exhale, she said, “I’d go back. I would.”
</p>

<p>
“Even if it meant an earlier death?”
</p>

<p>
“Because I’m a baron’s daughter, and I would have a definite place.”
</p>

<p>
“And you don’t have a place here?”
</p>

<p>
Just then a wind burst caused a shower from the branches above. Emily
	glanced over at her friend, wondering if she had pushed too
	hard. Annette finally spoke: “My true self would be growing in
	proper soil. And my death . . . I would trust my death, came
	it early or late.”
</p>

<p>
“You would accept an early death?”
</p>

<p>
“Death cannot be rejected, so our acceptance of it is irrelevant. Our
lives, our deaths are in God’s hands.”
</p>

</blockquote></div>


<p>
So no, I'm not romanticising any part of it. Just the opposite. Life
in the first half of the nineteenth century was much harsher than
today's. But it was more real for it.
</p>

<p>
I look at today's fecklessness, our relatively facile lives and wonder
if a dose of harshness isn't what we need. I'm hardly original with
this idea. There are so many who have advocated harshness&#x2014;in
carefully measured doses, that is. Which makes it really just posing,
theatre. Alas.

<h3 id="orge2bdae9">Politics?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge2bdae9">
<p>
Left, Right? Preferably neither nor. To me, today's political world is
like a junkyard of toxic memes, a procession of good cop, bad cop
entrapment schemes one after the other. Since the vibe of the Inland
Sea is what I'm really trying to capture, today's topsy-turvy,
house-of-mirros politics doesn't really need me adding my two cents
very often.
</p>

<p>
But since this is a tell-all FAQ I will come out and say point-blank I
believe American Democracy is failing. If you must know I'm a
<b>Monarchist</b>. What? You can't be serious! How can you possibly be a
Monarchist? Either you're just being a kooky contrarian&#x2014;or you've
been watching too much <i>Downton Abbey</i>.
</p>

<p>
It's taken me quite a while to become a Monarchist, but the seeds were
planted in my head while in Europe (seven years total; Germany,
Switzerland). To be sure, very many layers of scales fell from my eyes
while in Europe, one set being the issue of political systems. As some
wise and intelligent Germans enlightened me, there are really only two
political systems: Monarchism and Not-Monarchism. Not-Monarchism comes
in two flavours, namely, republican-representational systems commonly
referred to as democracies, and autocratic systems known as
dictatorships.
</p>

<p>
If there is one political belief we've all been taught from an early
age to accept unquestioningly, that would be democracy. But as was
pointed out to me, democracy really only works in the most optimal
settings and perfect conditions, i.e., societies that are relatively
peaceful and prosperous. In other words, only when the sun is shining
and the winds are calm does democracy seem to function&#x2014;at all. And
so if we look at a map of the world, only those places in the very
well developed world have what we'd call functioning democracies,
everywhere else, dysfunctional democracies of various stripes, out to
dictatorships.
</p>

<p>
Why is democracy only for the rich and stable? Because it is
representational, and that means <i>everyone</i>&#x2014;including all the "bad
sorts," all the people you don't like, don't get along with, all the
unintelligent and uninformed rubes&#x2014;get to participate. A democratic
elections put one group in power while the others are left out. Part
and parcel of every democracy are factions and so-called "special
interests." But of course political groupings can be rather benign
when the sun is shining and the breezes are gentle.
</p>

<p>
Special interests, parties, factions, lobbyists scurrying to-and-fro,
this group in, that group out&#x2014;none of it seems so bad when times are
good. But once any real problems or disagreements arise, these
divisions come out with a vengeance. And if things are really bad, the
power blocks grab their weapons and force their will upon society. One
gang is in power and their enemies, their opponents are liquidated. So
democracy and dictatorship are just two sides of the same coin. This
means no amount of vigilance or resolve can stop a dictator from
rising when the sun goes behind a cloud or the wind picks
up. Dictators simply come with the territory when the going gets
rough.
</p>

<p>
Seen in this light, we might lift ourselves above all of today's
tail-chasing and squabbling and see it all as just a transition period
from the one form of Not-monarchism to the other.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3eb7ed5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3eb7ed5">&#x2026;so what is monarchism?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3eb7ed5">
<p>
Let's start by saying the vast majority of Americans have no idea of
what monarchism really is, havig been fed all their lives a steady
diet of misinformation and Hollywood sensationalism. The monarchism
I'm on about started after the very nasty Dark Ages and matured into
<i>manorial</i> monarchism (MM)<label for="22" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="22" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
Manorial in the sense that manors throughout the land were
their version of the Communist agricultural collectives.
</span> in the medieval Europe.
</p>

<p>
As viewed from thirty-thousand feet, MM was a system devised to
properly manage a relatively sparse resources balance sheet on a
continent already for many thousands of years fully occupied and
settled. That is to say, not having an entire (stolen) Continent
brimming with resources and space at their disposal, Europeans had to
be careful space- and resource-wise on their old sod&#x2026; Hence, MM had
to strike an environmental balance, and it had to have teeth to
enforce this balance. MM was tight, stingy, and, when necessary,
harsh&#x2014;just like the land. Simply put, MM was a perfect, organic,
natural adaptation mirroring closely the conditions, the environmental
reality at hand. Tight resources translated into tight social norms
and boundaries. Life was stratified, hierarchical, and on a
budget. Stasis, maintenance, and niche behaviors, were called for, not
growth and dynamism, not every peasant gets to go anywhere and do
anything he wanted to. For such an old place as Europe, there was no
"go West young man" after overpopulating and using up the local
resources as there was in North America.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2b1d5c4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org2b1d5c4">&#x2026;so monarchism is mainly a sort of "deep" environmentalism, right?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2b1d5c4">
<p>
Very much so. Everything monarchical was primarily rooted in the
necessity of a real and functioning environmentalism.  /For what shall
it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own
soul?/ wasn't just a nice biblical quote. And so all of modern
"progress"&#x2014;our great rights and freedoms, the long list defeated
diseases and solved medical infirmities, the abundance of food in
stores and supermarkets, our magical high-tech&#x2014;what does any of it
matter if we devolve into degenerates and crash the planet
environmentally? Then the whole MM scheme to limit, control, suppress
humans to not exceed the <b>real</b> limits of the land, of reality on this
planet will once again seem genial. It already does to me.
</p>

<p>
Basically, democracy has descended into the masses voting for <i>more</i>,
that is, <i>evermore</i> prosperity, <i>evermore</i> ease and comfort. And those
two dodgy economic systems born of the Industrial Revolution,
capitalism and socialism, vie to give the voters what they really
want. Yes, science and technology have afforded us many "more with
less" boons, but at some point this whole business of evermore people
demanding evermore resources (evermore-evermore) will have to yield to
reality.
</p>

<p>
Consider the fact that you and I are consuming upwards of one hundred
times more resources and energy per capita than our ancestors from the
year 1800 did. How can that go on? It can't. So I guess I'm not all
that concerned about everyone's rights or prosperity or ease and
comfort if we fall apart as a society or render the Earth
uninhabitable. At some point structure and stability must win over
fantasies and slobbery.

<p>
The short answer is yes. In my youth I was a great advocate of the
"Star Trek" future, a techno-Utopia as promised by classic science
fiction. But then I learned about the <i>Jevons Paradox</i><label for="23" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="23" class="margin-toggle"/><span class="sidenote">
In economics, the Jevons paradox (sometimes Jevons' effect)
occurs when technological progress or government policy increases the
efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount
necessary for any one use), but the rate of consumption of that
resource rises due to increasing demand.[1] The Jevons paradox is
perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics.[2]
However, governments and environmentalists generally assume that
efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the
possibility of the paradox arising. (Taken from Wikipedia)
</span>, which
basically says we never really get more with less from each
progressive improvement in technology. It is primarily for this
diminishing returns from technology that I've been forced to give up
on any sort of modern take on environmentalism.  Again, it, like so
many other modern variations, assumes that we can save the planet if
we simply change how we're applying, deploying technology. Sorry, but
we're long past any tweaks. And no, Elon Musk and EVs will not save
us. The backlog of intractable environmental problems created by
evermore-evermore cannot be solved by the capitalist-socialist
industrialist state simply recombining itself.
</p>

<p>
And I could not avoid how modern sci-fi has taken a decidedly dark
turn into what came to be known as <i>cyberpunk</i>, typically a
near-future <i>dystopian</i> modern-realist fiction. Everything cyberpunk
was nightmarish&#x2014;mainly because futuristic technology and human
social-psychology do not play well together.
</p>

<p>
But the camel's back was broken when Mark Zuckerberg announced his big
push into virtual reality with <i>Meta</i>. We've sat through films like
<i>Ex Machina</i> and <i>Her</i>. We've read Neal Stephenson and William
Gibson. Now we're supposed to actually step into those nightmares

<p>
I don't see a choice. I'm not a <i>prepper</i> or a doomsday conspiracy
theorist, but really, how can this work? At the human psychological
level, we are creating a world of "smart" devices that are not human,
that cannot truly integrate or assimilate with our unique logic and
emotion tuning. At best artificial intelligence will <i>simulate</i>
humanness&#x2014;something truly creepy at best, disastrous in all
inevitability.
</p>

<p>
I don't know how much of a Christian I am, but let's say God created
us and tuned us to be this very specific balance between our logical
neocortex and our limbic system emotions. We understand this about one
another and make adjustments accordingly. But will the legions of AI
be able to truly join in with this social-psychology? No. Or if it
does, the results will be disastrous for us.

then a quarter English (my paternal grandmother was English) and the
rest German and Swedish, as my name, Bottorff, (or von Bottorff) is
German, an old aristocratic-patrician house that gave up titles and
wealth to follow Luther in the sixteenth century. We're not really
Swedish, but our DNA can be found in Sweden since lots of patrician
Germans fled religious persecution and resettled at the behest of the

This would exclude Sigurd F. Olson (1899 – 1982) an true
long-time Arrowhead bard, but who was decidedly Scandinavian
impressionistic in the spirit of Robert Frost. Boomer buy-in for
Sigurd was minimal.

Another set of leapers would be they who jumped from suburb

According to AncestryDNA I'm Scottish, English, German, and
Swedish, although the Swedish is probably a "false positive" as my
German ancestors fled religious persecution to Protestant Sweden in

The modern meaning of <i>goth</i> is really more about Dark Romantic
and not gothic per se. I mean to keep <i>goth</i> separate from <i>gothic</i>,
which is a horror/melodrama genre. However most "experts" typically
don't grasp this nuance&#x2026;

All too often the modern academe invents, projects, imagines

In economics, the Jevons paradox (sometimes Jevons' effect)
occurs when technological progress or government policy increases the
efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount
necessary for any one use), but the rate of consumption of that
resource rises due to increasing demand.[1] The Jevons paradox is
perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics.[2]
However, governments and environmentalists generally assume that
efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the
possibility of the paradox arising. (Taken from Wikipedia)
