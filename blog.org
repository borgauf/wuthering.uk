* Why Trump won

** The Left pushed the commoners too far

The simplest way to explain Donald Trump's victory is to realize the
Left tried to push the common man/woman too far. The Left asked the
Average Janes and Joes, the salt of the earth, yes, let's call them
what they are, the /peasants/ to go to too many places they just
couldn't go, to do too many things they just couldn't do. As
sociologist Jonathan Haidt said (and I paraphrase liberally), The Left
is rabidly anti-past. They believe the past is a graveyard of our
mistakes, that the present is the best time to be alive, thus, a
flying wall of hyper-idealistic leftisms must constantly fly at
society in order to keep correcting social ills and historical
mistakes. The Right, on the other hand, believes just the opposite,
i.e., that some past age was golden, that we must return to it. When
you understand this, you understand a whole lot about today's politics
... and why Trump won. His /Make America Great Again/ slogan is pure
nostalgia for the past.

Haidt has also described how a certain sector of the population, when
pushed too far, will "snap back." By that he means they will reach
desperately for a quasi-dictator who promises immediate relief from
the dysphoria of having been pushed too far leftward. As I've written
before, humans are far less logical and far more "freak-out" driven
than we will admit. That is to say, we collectively freak-out,
sometimes completely irrationally, with devastating
consequences. Germany in the 1930s freaked out---and the rest is
history.

What all right-wing dictators have in common is impatience. If the
vehicle of state is going down the highway at 120 mph the Wrong Way,
well, the dictator immediately throws the transmission into
reverse---with devastating results. But don't worry, Leftists, Trump
will not be able to do this. There are still enough checks and
balances to keep him to a slower pace. How do I know this? Read on.

** Trump is a showman

Yes, Trump is certainly a showman. But so was Hitler. The difference
was that many of the 1930s German Powers That Be privately were for,
encouraged Hitler to seize dictatorial power. Nobody is really doing
that with Trump---other that perhaps Steve Bannon. Yes, American
democracy is seriously ailing. When elections are not accepted by one
side, as in the 2020 election, then democracy is basically over. And
yet Trump vacated the White House and his followers did not morph into
/Sturmabteilung/ Brownshirt street thug paramilitaries. Which means
our democracy is in critical condition but not yet dead.

** Yes, MAGA, yes nostalgia, but...

Nostalgia for what exactly? This of course is where any nostalgic
fantasizing breaks up on the rocks of reality. Yes, maybe we could in
theory all become Amish. After all, the Amish are holding to a strict
set of rules and principles that keep them "back" from modern
times. But can a whole society ever agree which rules and principles
to artificially hold to? After all, with such liberalized
resources,[fn:1] liberalized social policies will and certainly do
follow. Short of an apocalyptic Dark Age throwing /all/ of society
back into a quasi-Stone Age, we cannot put the liberalism genie back
in the bottle---except in artificially staged ways as do the Amish who
are surrounded by the resource- and socially-liberal world. Think
about a monk or nun sitting in a monastery or convent. Every second of
every day they know they could walk away from the aesthete life of
minimalism and self-denial, which is why I say...

** Trump is /not/ conservative

No, Trump is not really conservative, rather, he is libertarian. And
libertarianism is really just a new form of liberal. And so liberalism
has gotten so big that Leftism can no longer contain it all and some
has spilled into this nether-region outside of Leftism---to be
claimed, falsely labeled as conservatism. So what is true
conservatism? Real conservatism is when every part of life is geared
towards conserving, first, resources, then behaviors necessarily
tracking with the conservative resource base. Think Medieval Age
England with its limited space, good soil, its periodic famines,
maxed-out forestry, harsh winters, etc. Conservatism had to be the way
of life.

I say in this modern landscape of wall-to-wall materialism that no
real conservatism is possible. Again, a tight resource base
necessitates conservative behaviors. And we no long have these
conditions. Thus, any conservatism today is strictly /pro forma/, and
riddled with libertarianisms, i.e., liberalism that is not
leftist. This means Trumpism is really just a peasant rebellion, he
the peasant chieftain. Which we've seen before, and typically go
nowhere and must be put down.

** We've seen this before

Way back in the early 1800s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Wolfgang_von_Goethe][Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] made a serious
break with Romanticism, calling Romanticism and its followers and
proponents "everything that is sick about modern society."[fn:2] There
is a whole world and its history behind this simple-seeming
pronouncement. As you may know Goethe[fn:3] was the leading German
intellectual and its most lauded bard of his time. But he broke with
the leaders, the artists of Romanticism (beginning ca. 1800 in Jena)
mainly due to their largely irresponsible behavior and airy-fairy
ideas. Goethe, born middle-class, had been ennobled, placed by his
liege Karl August, Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach in charge of various
Weimar Court posts. He was also a "veteran" of sorts of the disastrous
French Revolution, which had given all "freedom fighters" of the time
pause. Basically, Goethe could not accept that the best-and-brightest,
the educated elite of the times were off chasing "feelings," fairies
in the forests, waxing nostalgic for the Medieval Age or some
proto-European times, acting aloof from the cares of the day. He
countered Romanticism with his take on Classicism which came to be
called /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Classicism][Weimar Classicism]]/ where looking back to the high aesthetics
of the Greeks was the place to start. But isn't this exactly what the
Trump side is saying about today's Intelligentsia and educated elites?
Pragmatism was lacking from Romaticism---as it is today from the
flying wall of leftist hyper-idealisms coming at us from our supposed
best-and-brightest.



* The Great Stall-out

/The Jetsons/ was an animated sitcom from 1962-63 showing us what
future space-age suburban life would be like. I was a little kid back
then and we all thrilled to each episode. So exciting, so cool it was
to think about all the great technological advancements just around
the corner. But when the film /The Graduate/ came out in 1967 dealing
head-on with vapid, dysfunctional, existential meaningless
middle-class suburban life, something had changed and modern life was
mysteriously suspect, expectations seriously downgraded.[fn:4] Sure,
we limped along for the next decades with progress, even "futurism,"
but the space race seemed stuck in those largely meaningless space
shuttle launches, the push to get kids into STEM tanked, and the only
truly positive sci-fi, /Star Trek/ gave it up with the early
cancellation of /Enterprise/ in 2005.[fn:5] Odd how
humans---narrative-based as we are---have had no real positive,
futuristic storytelling to latch onto since those halcyon 1960s.

And so I ask, How can technologically, materialistically forward not
be the way forward anymore? Think about it. Humans strove for
centuries to reach the science and technology pinnacle we had achieved
by the 1960s---with even more amazing advances right around the
corner! But for some reason the air started leaking out of the tires,
positive thinking about the future waned, and many of us became
doubters, questioning and even rejecting the high-tech, the
materialism, the progress, the wealth, the modernism. And so today we
are gripped by an anomie, an ennui of seemingly unknown origins.[fn:6]

You might say progress is still humming along. The iPhone is version
16, the electric vehicles are beginning to get solid-state batteries,
wind and solar are much cheaper than any fossil fuel, huge rockets are
now grabbed by mechanical chopsticks upon reentry, and the computing
world is roaring forward with AI, robotics, quantum computing. And yet
I can see the peak, i.e., the end of this mad rush. The spirit is
surely waning, the dynamism just about to crash and burn. Oh yes, a
small elite core are still driving on with their amazing
overachieving, but the man on the street could care less. Complexity
grows, technology rocks---but the average citizen is regressing back
to a medieval level of knowledge and education.

Indeed, we're stalling out. And all sorts of quasi-nostalgia peddlers
are coming out of the woodwork to entice the masses into---into what
exactly? But then if the way forward is not forward as we've defined
it for literally centuries, then what are we doing, /where are we
going/? Ever since this unbelievable, impossible to have predicted sea
change of progress stalling out, I've noticed everything slowly coming
unraveled in society. Now I see the predictions of the cyberpunk
near-future dystopian stories coming true, all while things still seem
to be functioning, suburbs are occupied, and modern high-tech
materialism is still on track. And yet people are heading to various
nostalgic exit doors. My boys grew up in the 2000s with /Lord of the
Rings/ and /Harry Potter/, two vaguely medieval nostalgia trips.[fn:7]
Then the fantasy wave, all of it set in some quasi-past, typically a
parallel Medieval Age. This alongside very grimy, depressing dystopian
near-future "cyberpunk" sci-fi basically slamming the door on the
future. No more Jetsons and no more positive Utopian sci-fi. But then
The Powers That Be tried to slam the nostalgia door with /Game of
Thrones/, which wanted the Medieval Age to be awful horrible. But it's
too late. The modern world is paralyzed in ennui and great confusion
over what direction we should go. Basically, the entire Muslim world
is reaching for something bygone. The main radical factions are all
some version of primitivists. Then all the autocrats doing Backwards
like Putin et al. Alas. And no, Elon Musk isn't going to revive some
Jetsons futurism.

This is really crazy when you think about it. Consider how
scientifically advanced the Covid vaccines were. To hear the science
behind the mRNA is to marvel at how so much advancement came together
so perfectly. Never before had a vaccine been rolled out so quickly
and had such off-the-charts efficacy. But then came the huge
irrationalist backlash, the all but superstitious opposition
demonizing the vaccines. So many people these days have become
degenerate, disenchanted, dysfunctional, depressed, cynical, addicted,
etc. all because they've somehow missed the progress bus. Why is all
this amazing progress not taken up by more people and used as a
springboard to amazing lives and Utopian pursuits? Crazy weird this
situation. Don't know how it will end.

* The Great Internet Detox

Here I've finally got my website up and running and I immediately want
to go cold-turkey from the internet? Ironic for sure. Though I'm not
sure I should start immediately. But really, if I am supposedly on
some sort of back-to-nature nostalgia trip, or as some have called it,
"[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottagecore][Cottagecore]],"[fn:8] then I should not pretend to be like I'm Henry David
Thoreau back in his offline/off-grid cottage in the woods, all while
running a very plugged-in, connected, high-tech online presence.

Let's be honest, the internet has proven to be one step forward and
two steps backward for most of society. I've noticed how being online
has changed me, my daily habits and routines, and I know I'm suffering
for it, i.e., what I've gotten out of it lags far behind the negative
consequences.[fn:9] And so I want to get off the internet and avoid
screens...

...but of course that's not entirely possible in this day and
age---unless we actually do live like an off-grid, offline hermit in
the woods. Hence, I want to "mainly" get off, by which I mean I will

+ only be online to do absolutely necessary work-related things
+ one daily check of only email, phone, or messages
+ absolutely no "social media" e.g., Facebook, Instagram, X/Twitter, etc.
+ no online reference or research
+ no online entertainment
+ only the most absolute bare necessities from online stores, i.e., no
  browsing shopping.

Of course this may seem draconian, especially the bit about no
reference or research online. Why? Because the temptation to keep
click and swiping and scrolling is ever-present, that experts say this
whole screen-online experience has very real psychological addiction
issues. But hey, let's just slow down!

I plan to dive into my German lit again, which I've neglected for so
long. I do have plenty of real, hold-in-hands books that have been
gathering dust for many years. Now is the time to get out of the
internet rat race.

It will be hard. I know because I've tried and failed many times
before. Internet-screen addiction is a very insidious, and going off
this constantly connected state leaves me feeling---detached, adrift,
lost, depressed, anxious, without purpose or meaning. But I know that
I'm only getting fake fulfillment from being online, that whomever I
imagine myself engaging with is complete illusion. Who's to say we are
not at some ChatGPT juncture where some chatbot is pretending to be my
advocate, friend, supporter---as in the frightening film /Her/?

I once thought I'd really do this whole project up, i.e., not just
internet detox, but do a sort of "historical reenactment theater"
where I would pretend to be a German nobleman (in period costume) come
to the American wilds for to gather observations, a la [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville][Alexis de
Tocqueville]]. No, just getting offline will be a good beginning.

I also thought that once I got this Wuthering.UK site up I'd launch a
total media blitz, anchored by a YouTube channel where I'd do videos
after videos and get real famous and rich. But then I thought, Does
the world need another braying ass going on about how he knows better
than all the other braying asses? No. I've come to a very big
realization in my life, namely, that I really don't know
anything. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to forgive/ignore those
around me who know even less; hence, a detox will help me work on this
last hurdle to absolute perfection.
