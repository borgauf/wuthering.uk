* The Great Internet Detox

Here I've finally got my website up and running and I immediately want
to go cold-turkey from the internet? Ironic for sure. But if I am
supposedly on some sort of back-to-nature nostalgia trip, or as some
have called it, "[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottagecore][Cottagecore]]," then I should not pretend to be like
some Henry David Thoreau back in his offline, off-grid cottage in the
woods, all while running a very connected, high-tech online presence.

Let's be honest, the internet has proven to be one step forward and
two steps backward for most of society. I've noticed how being online
has changed me, my daily habits and routines, and I know I'm suffering
for it, i.e., what I've gotten out of it lags far behind the negative
consequences.[fn:1] And so I want to "get off the internet/screen."
But of course that's not entirely possible in this day and
age---unless we live like an off-grid, offline hermit in the
woods. Hence, I want to "mainly" get off, by which I mean I will

+ only be online to do absolutely necessary work-related things
+ one daily check of only email, phone, or messages
+ absolutely no "social media" e.g., Facebook, Instagram, X/Twitter, etc.
+ no online reference or research
+ no online entertainment
+ only the most absolute bare necessities from online stores

Of course this may seem draconian, especially the bit about no
reference or research online. Why? Because the temptation to keep
click and swiping and scrolling is ever-present, that experts say this
whole screen-online experience has very real psychological addiction
issues. But hey, let's just slow down!

I plan to dive into my German lit again, which I've neglected for so
long. I do have plenty of real, hold-in-hands books that have been
gathering dust for many years. Now is the time to get out of the
internet rat race.

It will be hard. I know because I've tried and failed many times
before. Internet-screen addiction is a very insidious, and going off
this constantly connected state leaves me feeling---detached, adrift,
lost, depressed, anxious, without purpose or meaning. But I know that
I'm only getting fake fulfillment from being online, that whomever I
imagine myself engaging with is complete illusion. Who's to say we are
not at some ChatGPT juncture where some chatbot is pretending to be my
advocate, friend, supporter---as in the frightening film /Her/?

I once thought I'd really do this whole project up, i.e., not just
internet detox, but do a sort of "historical reenactment theater"
where I would pretend to be a German nobleman (in period costume) come
to the American wilds for to gather observations, a la [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexis_de_Tocqueville][Alexis de
Tocqueville]]. No, just getting offline will be a good beginning.

I also thought that once I got this Wuthering.UK site up I'd launch a
total media blitz, anchored by a YouTube channel where I'd do videos
after videos and get real famous and rich. But then I thought, Does
the world need another braying ass going on about how he knows better
than all the other braying asses? No. I've come to a very big
realization in my life, namely, that I really don't know
anything. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to forgive/ignore those
around me who know even less; hence, a detox will help me work on this
last hurdle to absolute perfection.
