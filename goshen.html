<p class="myindent"><span class="cap3">I think the Nilis Family was crazy.</span> They were from Belgium, and how they
wound up in Goshen, Tennessee, nobody seemed to know for sure.
Supposedly, the father had a cousin here and it was the cousin&rsquo;s house;
but nobody had ever laid eyes on either of them. So it was just the
mother Digna, the girl Seega, and her younger brother Dirk who was my
age ever living there. Dirk told me they were from Antwerp and
<i>Ant-werp</i> meant &ldquo;hand throw&rdquo; in their language, because a long time ago
some guy had cut off his hand and thrown it in the river&#x2026;</p>
</p>

<p>
Seega was real cute, but weird, too. All the guys were scared of her,
even the football players. She was tall and skinny and looked like
those models in the fashion magazines. &ldquo;Poor child&rsquo;s half-starved,&rdquo;
said Mama.  Seega wore black outfits and listened to weird music and
always seemed mad at everybody. &ldquo;Grim,&rdquo; said Papa. Dirk was just the
opposite. He was real nice and really good looking, to boot. &ldquo;Magnetic
personality,&rdquo; said Mama. &ldquo;Born salesman,&rdquo; said Papa. The girls at
school pestered him&#x2014;even the older ones&#x2014;but he was real
shy. Anyways, we were only freshmen and just barely knew what girls
were for in that way.
</p>

<p>
Their house, a great big old Victorian, was on Colonial Street just
east of the square. Folks said the whole street was haunted. The story
goes that towards the end of the war the Yanks rounded up a bunch of
Nathan Bedford Forrest&rsquo;s boys and shot them right there on the street
because they were supposed to have been war criminals,
marauders. Since then, people have seen &ldquo;Forrest&rsquo;s ghosts&rdquo; wandering
all round that part of town&#x2014;up to the courthouse, in and out of the
old houses&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Talk of haints made Papa angry, though. He was the Lutheran minister in
town. It was a real fight each year just to have Halloween and carve
pumpkins and go trick-or-treating. He was always saying Halloween was
pagan and ought to be ignored by Christians. Mama usually came in on our
side, and he&rsquo;d let us go trick-or-treating and carve one pumpkin.
</p>

<p>
And it was just after Halloween when the trouble started. We heard that
Digna had &ldquo;taken sick&rdquo; and had to go to a special hospital in Nashville.
Then the judge decided Seega and Dirk should live with us! That first
evening Mama and Papa asked us to stay in our rooms while they talked
private with Seega and Dirk in the living room. But soon we heard Seega
shouting in her funny-sounding English, then the front door slam. When I
came out, there was poor Dirk just staring ahead. He didn&rsquo;t talk anymore
after that. He ate and dressed himself and used the bathroom all right;
but he acted like he couldn&rsquo;t see or hear me.
</p>

<p>
The next week the sheriff and the doctor came to take Dirk to the
hospital in Nashville. Before they left, the sheriff asked Mama to go
over to their old house on Colonial Street&#x2014;because everybody knew
that&rsquo;s where Seega was hiding&#x2014;and &ldquo;have a talk with that little
lady.&rdquo; Mama went, but when she came back she looked all shook up. When
she finally said something, she said Seega had gone crazy and was
screaming over and over, <i>this place does not exist!</i> Then Mama
wouldn&rsquo;t talk anymore&#x2014;not the next day nor the next. It went on for
over a week like that, her just staring into space. Finally, she had
to go to Nashville, too. She came back before Christmas, but she was
different somehow: sad, quiet mostly, hollow-eyed. Once she whispered
to me that Seega was right, that Goshen didn&rsquo;t really exist. I got
real afraid and cried. Nothing was ever the same again after that.
