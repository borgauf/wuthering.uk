Light snow drifts gently down from the low clouds draped over a misty
boreal forest. Deer in their grey winter coats process along invisible
lines through the fir and spruce. Ravens and crows dolefully croak and
caw back and forth. Such an ambience to convey my thoughts, my
impressions and <i>feelings</i> about my dark proclivities, my <i>Dark
Muse</i>.<label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.2856921' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.2856921' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>
<i>muse</i>: Originally any of the nine sister goddesses in Greek
mythology presiding over music, literature, and arts; <i>or</i> a state of
deep thought or abstraction, e.g., to enter a <i>muse</i> over a poem; <i>or</i>
a source of inspiration, e.g., <i>Jane Austen is my muse</i>.

Do you find it difficult to describe your fascination with things on
the gloomy side? You often find <i>dreamy</i> what others find <i>dreary</i>
&#x2026; as when an overcast day brings on a strangely sanguine melancholy
&#x2026; or a stormy night is magnificent in a frightening and thrilling
sort of way? Twilight is a welcome reprieve from the hectic, incessant
day, freeing your senses, calming, deepening your thoughts. You&rsquo;ve
paused to gaze transfixed upon a lonely, nondescript landscape, a
wild, deserted shore, an old, abandoned cemetery. As when a decaying,
overgrown, other-century structure makes you envious of the bats
living there. Unnatural is having to get out of heat into air
conditioning and suffer through smalltalk while drinking iced
beverages; truer it seems to come inside out of the cold and sit by a
fire in a deep, shared silence drinking hot tea. Time and again what
they find &ldquo;uplifting&rdquo; is piteously trite out to ruefully disappointing
for you. Panic and nausea well up when somebody is flogging
sunny-cheery. It is then being alone is a relief, not at all
lonely. They seem to bounce from spectacular to spectacular; while
things subtle, veiled, shadowy tenuous, understated are your
druthers. Their heroes grasp desperately for cheeriness and must have
happy endings. Yours learn and grow by facing the grim and harsh&#x2014;and
if that means succumbing to the thrashing, amen, requiescat in pace,
RIP, c&rsquo;est la vie, time for mourning black.<label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.572549' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.572549' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>

over artificial light, linen over nylon, old architecture over new,
the genial disorder of wild nature over the forced containment of
gardens. If in a city, you can&rsquo;t stand anywhere but the oldest
quarter, oldest park, oldest cemetery. And yes, it might seem a bit to
ask, but wouldn&rsquo;t it be grand if every month we celebrated
Halloween?&#x2026;  If yes to any or (hopefully) all of this, you might
understand what I&rsquo;m trying to say here.

<p>
I provide here a quote from Charlotte Brontë&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Eyre">Jane Eyre: An
Autobiography</a></i>. Main protagonist Jane describes the house of her
adoptive family, the Rivers, called simply <i>Moor House</i>, and the
environs on the edge of the wild Yorkshire moors during the reign of
George III<label id='fnr.3' for='fnr-in.3.1716693' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.3.1716693' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>3</sup>
The word <i>moor</i> appears forty-three times in <i>Jane Eyre</i>. After
the second or third use, I was just putty in Charlotte&rsquo;s hands&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
They loved their sequestered home. I, too, in the grey, small, antique
structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering
walls, its avenue of aged firs&#x2014;all grown aslant under the stress of
mountain winds; its garden, dark with yew and holly&#x2014;and where no
flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom&#x2014;found a charm both
potent and permanent. They clung to the purple moors behind and around
their dwelling&#x2014;to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path
leading from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks
first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields
that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a
flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy-faced
lambs&#x2014;they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of
attachment. I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its
strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality. I felt the
consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell
and sweep&#x2014;on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by
moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken,
and mellow granite crag. These details were just to me what they were
to them&#x2014;so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. The strong blast
and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of
sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for
me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them&#x2014;wound round my
faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#x2026; <i>the consecration of its loneliness</i> indeed. I often read this
passage just to muse upon the wistful, moody, delicately melancholic,
intentionally anti-spectacular subtleties she describes&#x2014;and how this
and other choice moments set the whole tone and mood of the
book. Charlotte Brontë establishes light and dark as equals, then
works expertly with the gradient there between. The dim, the shadows,
the dark, the harsh, even at times merciless inclemencies are features
not bugs. She does not suppress dark, perhaps knowing that if it were
seen an equal to light it would eventually prove itself the older,
wiser sibling, capable of rich, complimentary contributions.
</p>

<p>
One notable gradient boon is how she has the Moor House environs so
very abandoned, lonely, hence, ultra-wild <i>exactly</i> because they are
so unpresuming and overlooked, so bereft of anything
nature-spectacular &#x2026; as opposed to some breathtaking, necessarily
primordial wilderness millions of miles away, visited only by the most
intrepid explorers.<label id='fnr.4' for='fnr-in.4.5738824' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.4.5738824' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>4</sup>
&#x2026;or by modern, well-off tourists.
</span> Indeed, subtle and unassuming become the
older, wiser siblings of grand and spectacular. Notable too how Jane
arrived at Moor House&#x2014;on her hands and knees half dead from hunger
and exposure, thus, adding complete and ultimately <i>necessary</i>
vulnerability to this sublime mix. It is exactly this vulnerability
that qualifies her as a real part of the scene. And once recovered,
she is still every bit the underdog&#x2014;relative to us today in our
modern nature-dominating high-tech, hyper-materialist world where we
are nothing but astronauts on our own planet. This point is key to
what I&rsquo;ll say later&#x2026;

The second half of my childhood was spent in Tennessee,<label id='fnr.5' for='fnr-in.5.2232248' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.5.2232248' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>5</sup>
&#x2026;the first half in Southern Illinois.
</span> and my
favourite place was the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smoky_Mountains_National_Park">Great Smoky Mountains National Park</a></i> high on
the ancient Appalachian Mountains border of Tennessee and North
Carolina. The <i>Smokies</i> are a federally protected, quasi-pristine
wilderness of 522,419 acres, surrounded by lesser-protected though
still technically wilderness USDA National Forest lands, adding
another million or so acres. Statistics say the GSMNP itself is the
most-visited of all U.S. national parks with nearly fourteen million
tourists per year,<label id='fnr.6' for='fnr-in.6.8061131' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.6.8061131' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>6</sup>
&#x2026;more than double the next most popular, the Grand Canyon&#x2026;
</span> with additional tourist attractions and
accommodations all around the park boundaries. And what are these
visitors doing? Nothing like early-nineteenth-century Jane on her
moor. Only a tiny fraction are actually out on the park&rsquo;s extensive
wilderness trails hiking and camping. Most are either driving up and
down the main dissecting highway connecting Tennessee to North
Carolina or simply crowding into the visitor centres, again, via our
modern spaceship-like automobiles. Many years ago I visited on a
Fourth of July, stopping in the main tourist town bordering the park,
Gatlinburg, Tennessee, where the sidewalks were practically
standing-room-only. But later that same day I hiked for hours deep in
the park on the main Appalachian Trail and saw not another
human&#x2026; Strange as this may sound, I say Jane&rsquo;s Yorkshire moorlands
are <i>real</i> nature, while the Smokies are something else, simply
because of the sheer abstraction, the artificiality of their purpose,
not to mention their being so recognised, their well-known-ness
throughout the entire world.
</p>

<p>
To be sure, the Smokies are fussed and ruled over by legions of
scientists and bureaucrats at the behest of the U.S. Department of
Interior&rsquo;s National Park Service, UNESCO&rsquo;s World Heritage Convention,
the International Biosphere Programme, etc., like some great research
terrarium under an invisible glass dome. Even in the remotest,
genuinely wild spots many miles from any human disturbance, the weight
of humanity&rsquo;s lurking dominance, our collective mental presence is
inescapably massive&#x2026; And so we have the dichotomy of discovered
versus undiscovered, exotic versus vernacular, integrated versus
detached, grounded versus abstract, thousands versus no matches to
googling. As the Rivers&rsquo; guest, Jane Eyre described a natural and
organic connection to her moorland. And yet no modern tourist can ever
expect to become truly integrated with the GSMNP <i>complex</i> as Jane was
with her moorlands.<label id='fnr.7' for='fnr-in.7.6442931' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.7.6442931' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>7</sup>
Perhaps give the Smokies a second chance by reading the
pre-park fictional work <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christy_(novel)">Christy</a></i> by Catherine Marshall. She captures
something that might be called <i>Appalachian Gothic</i>.

<h3 id="org1520f12">My Dark <i>penchant</i></h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1520f12">
<p>
Continuing, I am at a loss to explain my dark <i>penchant</i> to those who
do not, cannot, will not get it. To be darkly inclined as I mean it is
a take-it-or-leave-it proposition; <i>either one gets Dark or one does
not</i>.<label id='fnr.8' for='fnr-in.8.9214321' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.8.9214321' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>8</sup>
Allow me the poetic emphasis device of capitalising nouns.
</span> Dark as I mean it was best presented and developed by
certain <b>poets</b> of the early-nineteenth century <i>Romantic</i> Era,<label id='fnr.9' for='fnr-in.9.1471703' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.9.1471703' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>9</sup>
Quick preliminary, much more later: The term Romanticism
followed a twisted path beginning with the Latin <i>romant</i>, or, &ldquo;in the
Roman manner&rdquo;, thus, not at all our current use of the word as a
synonym of lovey-dovey stuff. In general, bundling what I&rsquo;m trying to
get at as <i>Romanticism</i> is fraught to say the least. Academe wants to
grip butterflies, but when they open their hands there is only
goo. Lots more on this problem as we go&#x2026;
</span>
an <i>emergent</i> property, and a very special private corner of this
ultimately maligned and misunderstood time. I also believe <i>the Dark
Muse is best expressed in poetry</i>, but hardly ever as well in
prose. I, as well as many others of yore, believe that lyrical poetry
captures far more and drives far deeper than whatever can be lined up
in book-length chains of prose sentences. For example, it is almost as
if the poetess Emily Dickinson used words so very cryptically to
expose just how tenuous words really are. She routinely made strings
of words give up their ghosts just to swap in even more mysterious
ghosts&#x2014;again, something really only doable with poetry. We&rsquo;ll
explore some of her amazing flights into <i>thoughts behind thoughts</i>
put to words as we go.
</p>

<p>
To be sure, my Dark Muse often comes on as a <i>feeling behind a
feeling</i>, subtle, maybe even profound, and yet fleeting, not availing
itself to logic-bound analysis or description or
intentionality.<label id='fnr.10' for='fnr-in.10.9670868' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.10.9670868' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>10</sup>
Yes, ironic that I&rsquo;m trying to be logical analytical here, no?
</span> One very important principal, the German poet
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novalis">Novalis</a>, penname for Baron Friedrich von Hardenberg, often used a
unique <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_fragment">fragment</a></i> writing style when describing his Dark Muse. And so
he abandoned even lyrical poetry to get yet again more bursty, more
spontaneous in order to capture the subtleties of his dark
impressions. Lots more about Novalis, the presumed founder of German
Romanticism, as we proceed. Dark stirrings arrive mostly unannounced,
a veritable surprise. <b>Dark is a gift</b>. Thus, my exploration of Dark
will rely heavily on the poetry of the preeminent Romantic Era
champions of the Dark Muse.

</span> And yet goth is one of the
elephants I feel I must shift a few inches from the centre of the
room. In very short, modern goths surely <i>sense</i> Dark,<label id='fnr.12' for='fnr-in.12.8196407' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.12.8196407' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>12</sup>
By the way, the Germans capitalise nouns, i.e., built-in
poetic emphasis.
</span> but, for
whatever reasons, so many of them only see fit to express it, explore
it very narrowly through goth music and fashion. My Dark Muse would
hopefully include, be akin to what is today called goth and gothic,
<i>but I will try to go deeper and be more elemental</i>. If you are goth I
hope you allow me to speak to your &ldquo;inner goth.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I believe there is a <i>natural darkness</i> provided initially by Nature,
a basis upon which we may create symbols, artefacts, icons, trappings
to emulate, decorate, magnify, socialise, humanise, if nothing else,
<i>bring indoors</i> this natural Dark. Yes to goth aesthetics, as far as
they may resonate, do honour to Dark. But too often our human take on
Dark unfortunately winds up overstated, overwrought&#x2014;all the way out
to grimy, ignoble, silly, scummy, stupid.<label id='fnr.13' for='fnr-in.13.7200933' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.13.7200933' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>13</sup>
&#x2026;and then the normies haul out their DSM-5s (<i>Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</i>) and pigeonhole us as
abnormal.
</span> We imbibe, then
express what we see, experience, feel; but I say this process must be
done carefully, if not respectfully. And so I have to respectfully
downgrade, reorder so many of the <i>gothic</i> horror fright memes, e.g.,
vampires, witches, demons; mean, nasty, menacing this, threatening,
evil that. Right up front: My Dark is not meant to shock or frighten,
rather, invite, deepen, and enrich. My Dark Muse contains nothing
cruel nor evil nor sinister nor satanic. As philosopher and
psychologist John Vervaeke said in describing the modern crisis of
anxiety and dysphoria, &ldquo;Horror is the <i>aesthetic</i> of when you feel
like you&rsquo;re losing your grip on reality.&rdquo; All right, I might dip my
toe in the lake of horror, as Alfred Hitchcock once said, but I
needn&rsquo;t dwell there too long. I do not want shock and terror to become
the default setting. And so mine is not the <i>Star Wars</i> &ldquo;dark side,&rdquo;
not dark barbarism à la <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, and not the psychic dark
described by Freud or Jung. I cringe when someone says, &ldquo;&#x2026;and then
things took a <i>dark</i> turn.&rdquo; Find a different adjective, please! In
general, let&rsquo;s drop the whole scary dark thing. Let&rsquo;s have a new
formula:
</p>

\begin{align*}
\large{\text{Dark} \ne \text{negative}}
\end{align*}

<p>
Yes, all right, once in a great while campy, over-the-top gothic can
be interesting, fun; but I&rsquo;d rather not lose sight of the source,
however obscure and rare it may be.<label id='fnr.14' for='fnr-in.14.711221' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.14.711221' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>14</sup>

More about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard">Jean Baudrillard</a> and his theories of simulacra and
hyperreality later. But for now, yes, Dark too often suffers from
hyper-Dark treatments.
</span> Right. Nature over the synthetic,
the industrial. Basically, <b>my Dark is about the sublime</b>, indeed,
<i>sublimity</i>. And yes, I will eventually deal with Edmund Burke&rsquo;s (as
well as Bertrand Russell&rsquo;s) false, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t get it at all&rdquo; tedium
on <i>sublimity</i> later. In the meantime, <i>sublime</i> is really just what
we may find beyond mere beauty, touching what Dostoevsky is saying
here
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are seconds, they only come five or six at a time, and you
suddenly feel the <b>presence of eternal harmony</b> (POEH) fully
achieved. It is nothing earthly; not that it is heavenly, but man
cannot endure it in his earthly state. One must change physically or
die. The feeling is clear and indisputable. As if you suddenly sense
the whole of nature and suddenly say: yes, this is true. This is not
tenderheartedness, but simply joy.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Awe ahead of joy? Again, much more fleshing out as we go along&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Allow me to hearken back to a golden era when Dark was the cultural
currency, i.e., roughly the first part of the nineteenth century, a
time when my key poets, my <i>principals</i> &#x2014; Poe, Novalis, the Brontës
&#x2014; showed us how triste and Stygian can be so very subtle and
sublime. And most important to modern goths, I&rsquo;m after something <i>I
will not outgrow</i>, rather, continue as my raison d&rsquo;être sustaining me
to my grave. I say there must be no &ldquo;aging out of the scene&rdquo; as I fear
often happens with modern goth. Rather, the Dark Muse should be a

Life would be empty, insipid, weak tea for me, every moment
rudderless, misspent, crushingly mundane were there not a strong and
constant current of the Dark Muse. It is as if nothing can be properly
understood without the dark perspective. But then I wonder, <b>is this
nature or nurture</b>?  That is to say, am I innately Dark, or is this
something to which I&rsquo;ve been acculturated?<label id='fnr.16' for='fnr-in.16.9115149' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.16.9115149' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>16</sup>
&#x2026; for example, due to the Victorian shadow thrown over my
childhood especially by my grandmother?
</span> I <i>feel</i> it is the
former. One simply has dark inclinations, one either <i>feels</i> the tug
of Dark&#x2014;regardless of any sort of prepping or grooming&#x2014;or one does
not.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s try a poetry litmus test. I present here a short, simple poem
from my main darkness benefactress, the poetess who stands at the
centre of everything I mean to say about Dark, the woman who rules me
from her grave, Emily Jane Brontë<label id='fnr.17' for='fnr-in.17.362816' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.17.362816' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>17</sup>
Look <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Bront%C3%AB">here</a> for a quick biography.  <br>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;<br>
Lengthen night and shorten day;<br>
Every leaf speaks bliss to me<br>
Fluttering from the autumn tree.<br>
I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br>
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Here Emily of Haworth, West Yorkshire, is direct, blunt even. She
either speaks to something deep internal, or you are part of the
majority who will find it&#x2014;weird, abnormal, <i>morbid</i>, overwrought,
puerile, even sick or evil. In my own life talking about my dark
<i>penchant</i> has gotten mostly deer-in-headlights responses, if not
outright hostility. The openly peeved see my dark druthers as morose,
as wallowing in self-pity, attention seeking, dwelling on the
negative. I beg to differ. I say I&rsquo;m not skewed to anything
particularly negative, morose, and certainly not morbid; rather, I
simply reject modern 24/7 cheeriness. Negative is a part
of real life, and this often hysteric spastic attempt to restrict life to
sunny-cheery happy-clappy is the real sickness in today&rsquo;s world. Alas
for all the &ldquo;mental health professionals&rdquo; who think they can &ldquo;train
your brain to think positively.&rdquo;<label id='fnr.18' for='fnr-in.18.9956131' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.18.9956131' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>18</sup>
The appallingly high percentages of people these days on
prescription psychopharmacology drugs or <i>pyscho-pharma</i>, &ldquo;happy
pills,&rdquo; is proof of what I&rsquo;m saying. Happy and sad cannot, should not
be controlled chemically.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Here is something a bit more relenting, but the same basic idea from
<i>Christina Rossetti</i> <label id='fnr.19' for='fnr-in.19.2535754' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.19.2535754' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>19</sup>
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Rossetti">here</a> for a bio. She is considered by many Britain&rsquo;s
most prolific poet. <br>

</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Fade tender lily,<br>
Fade O crimson rose,<br>
Fade every flower<br>
Sweetest flower that blows.<br>
<br>
Go chilly Autumn,<br>
Come O Winter cold;<br>
Let the green things die away<br>
Into common mould.<br>
<br>
Birth follows hard on death,<br>
Life on withering:<br>
Hasten, we shall come the sooner<br>
Back to pleasant Spring.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Rossetti is expressing the Dark Muse fatalistically, though she ends
with hope bound in humble expectancy. I like to think these two
English poetesses are expressing an informed, matured melancholy that
bespeaks a deeper understanding of life&#x2014;all deriving from a deep
grasp of, homage to Dark.
</p>

<p>
And another poem, here Longfellow&rsquo;s <i>Snow-flakes</i> from a collection
first published in 1863
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Out of the bosom of the Air,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken,<br>
Over the woodlands brown and bare,<br>

&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Silent, and soft, and slow<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Descends the snow.<br>
<br>
Even as our cloudy fancies take<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Suddenly shape in some divine expression,<br>
Even as the troubled heart doth make<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In the white countenance confession,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The troubled sky reveals<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;The grief it feels.<br>
<br>
This is the poem of the air,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Slowly in silent syllables recorded;<br>
This is the secret of despair,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Now whispered and revealed<br>

Go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow">here</a> for a quick biography. HWL was not typically Dark,
rather, a popular, &ldquo;uplifting&rdquo; poet with a big audience. That&rsquo;s what
makes this selection so unique for me.
</span> looking to the natural world and
<i>poetising</i>, to be sure, <i>darkly</i>. The idea of poetising, the
<i>poetisation</i> of nature and life was central to the Romantic
Movement.<label id='fnr.21' for='fnr-in.21.1165058' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.21.1165058' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>21</sup>
Below, we will go over Romanticism poetising&rsquo;s originator,
Novalis. Much to say about poetising, Novalis, and Romanticism&#x2026;
</span> This would be the poetry parallel to the
long-standing belief that we humans explain ourselves through, embed
our lives in narratives.<label id='fnr.22' for='fnr-in.22.7036216' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.22.7036216' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>22</sup>
&#x2026;more about storytelling below&#x2026;
</span> And so despair, grief, misery are
transformed into more equanimous states of sadness and melancholy,
hopefully bringing us to a higher emotional maturity. In some
paradoxical way, nature and darkness eventually become healers &#x2026; as
if the initial agony and sorrow of life&rsquo;s cruel blows are like a
ravaging cancer or virus. Which may eventually fade into
remission. Which we can never entirely conquer, eliminate whilst on
Earth. Hence, some strange symbiosis must be struck&#x2026; As I will explain,
being <i>mortal</i> was an entirely different experience back then, back
when very few <i>thrived</i>, rather, mostly only <i>survived</i>.<label id='fnr.23' for='fnr-in.23.3344225' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.23.3344225' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>23</sup>
A side question may be, Why in such bounteous, prosperous,
easy times as our today are so many people not thriving, rather, only
barely surviving&#x2014;mainly due to psychological infirmaries?  More on
the false gospel of thrive, thrive, thrive!  later&#x2026;

This <i>poetising</i> of Nature dark and mystical, this patient, reverent
knocking on Nature&rsquo;s door closed to us since the Fall from the Garden
of Eden, was the modus operandi of my select nineteenth-century
poets. Rather than avoid, they sought out, <i>embraced</i> their Dark Muse,
something we today in our brightly-lit, cordoned-off world usually
think of as bad, counter-productive, even dangerous. I contend we have
lost this subtle art of moving hardship, tragedy, emotional crises
into a stasis remission melancholy. Today, we vilify and wage
full-scale war against any and all recurring melancholia with
psychoanalysis and prescription psychopharmacology drugs. <i>Instead of
hysterically rushing in to counter &ldquo;negative&rdquo; thoughts with &ldquo;positive&rdquo;
thoughts, better to find a higher perspective on the inevitability of
the negative in life, no?</i> Really though, there is an unnaturalness to
chivvying a person into suppressing sad thoughts, to bombing the brain
with synthetic biochemistry. There is a desperate, embarrassing,
intelligence-insulting triteness to &ldquo;cheerful at all costs.&rdquo; Indeed,
cheeriness as a gateway drug&#x2026; And so all too often we are failures
at finding a <i>modus vivendi</i><label id='fnr.24' for='fnr-in.24.5913226' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.24.5913226' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>24</sup>
<i>modus vivendi</i>: An arrangement or agreement allowing
conflicting parties to coexist peacefully, either indefinitely or
until a final settlement is reached, <i>or</i> (literally) a way of living.
</span> vis-à-vis the trials and
tribulations of life as our ancestors once did. <i>Fazit</i><label id='fnr.25' for='fnr-in.25.8263294' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.25.8263294' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>25</sup>
<i>Fazit</i>: n; in conclusion, in summary, all in all; Germanized
Latin for <i>it follows</i>.
</span>: When
the negative is suppressed, we become exposed to a myriad of psychic
maladies. Better I say to find some dignity through Dark
aesthetics. Which, again, is exactly what our ancestors did. Another
Fazit: There is meaning in pain&#x2014;and even deeper meaning in <i>more</i>
pain. They knew this back in the day. So spoiled on the illusions and
expectations of easy modern life, we&rsquo;ve lost sight of this fact.

In her day, life was a struggle&#x2014;with entropy, adversity, depression,
with Death ready to lap over the gunwales of a person&rsquo;s little
lifeboat at any time. Emily Dickinson of mid-1800s Amherst,
Massachusetts, relates human suffering in a severe and fatalistic yet
grounded way by pulling me into a dark place where I am suddenly
thrown into reliance on alternative, finer, higher
sensibilities. Again, all we may ever do in our lives is disperse,
reorder the initially searing, inescapable pain of travesty to a dull,
hopefully diluted ache in the ever-growing backdrop of time. We never
&ldquo;win&rdquo; the race, but perhaps we do get recognition for
participating&#x2014;first and foremost from ourselves, then from the
network of fellow humans around us.<label id='fnr.27' for='fnr-in.27.8791831' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.27.8791831' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>27</sup>
Where has our human network gone? Something tells me getting
pity responses to a YouTube comment isn&rsquo;t the same&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<p>
As Emily of Amherst said in a letter <i>&#x2026;but to all except anguish the
mind soon adjusts</i>. Again I must say the subject of pain, suffering,
and loss was far better conducted in the past than they are
today. How, why? Because first and foremost they did not attempt to
contain, disguise, systematise, drug, or <i>process</i> greif; rather,
greif was faced directly, <i>pain was shared</i>, empathy a way of
interconnecting in a healthy communal life. And so emotional space was
allotted, support was natural, organic, openly shared. Strikingly
different from today was their acceptance of <i>doom</i><label id='fnr.28' for='fnr-in.28.6439167' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.28.6439167' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>28</sup>
Doom as unforeseen consequences of previous actions, which in
turn, entropically snowball into indebtedness, tragedy, and ruin;
typically multi-generational, a punishment that never seems to fit the
original crime&#x2014;if it was a crime at all. One German word for doom is
<i>Untergang</i>, which also means <i>downfall</i>.
</span> and fate,
two concepts antithetical to our dynamic, positivist,
self-determining, fix and paper over everything quickly modern
ways. This, in turn, led most to faith in God and acceptance of His
will.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The soul must go by Death alone, so, it must by life, if it is a soul. <br>
&#x2014;Emily Dickinson
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#x2026;alluding to The soul as an entity of both life and
death. Indeed. Especially death was handled so very differently back
then. Consider Queen Victoria<label id='fnr.29' for='fnr-in.29.7675764' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.29.7675764' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>29</sup>
Queen Victoria in mourning black ca. 1862. <br>
<img src="images/QueenVictoriaInMourningBlack.jpg" alt="QueenVictoriaInMourningBlack.jpg"> <br>
<br>
</span> who wore mourning black from the
time of her husband Prince Albert&rsquo;s death in 1861 until the end of her
life in 1901. Likewise, Amélie of Leuchtenberg who upon losing her
husband Pedro I of Brazil in 1834, wore mourning black until her death
in 1873. In those days death was properly, officially mourned. No one
tried to hustle mourners along with their grief and sadness. Contrast
this with today&rsquo;s all-too-prevalent disassociation, the confused
emotional shutdown, the disorganised quasi-denial and suppression we
moderns too often show towards death<label id='fnr.30' for='fnr-in.30.8811130' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>30</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.30.8811130' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>30</sup>
Is there anything worse than the so-called <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_stages_of_grief">five stages of
grief</a></i> or the Kübler-Ross model? Grief as an emotional malfunction
to be systematically reduced, fixed, corrected? Alas.
</span>. For the early nineteenth
century, poetising life&rsquo;s train of tragedy was <i>depression
deconstruction</i> as a life skill. The slings and arrows of human
existence found conjunction with <i>Nature</i>, <i>Dark</i>, and <i>Faith</i> through
poetry, thereby highlighting, elevating, <i>ennobling</i> our uniquely
human experience on Earth, thereby <b>casting a gossamer of sublimity
over our natural existence like no other generation before or
since</b>. Theirs was the deepest soundings of our humanness that I know,
and, thus, something I must pursue and showcase here.

<div id="outline-container-org94dc380" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org94dc380">But again, why Dark?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org94dc380">
<p>
Still, why Dark? Because Dark speaks to me. How? Why? Lack of a clear
and simple answer forces me into a regrettably wordier one. I might
say Dark remains mysterious&#x2014;no matter how many different angles from
which I try to express it. Dark is something instinctual, cathartic,
evocative, centring for me. Dark is more than the lack of light. Dark
can lead the imagination to riot. The moss, lichens, and mushrooms in
the secretive shadows of the forest incite so much more than the
spectacular sunny vista across the forest valley. Really though, I&rsquo;m
just not into spectacular&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The fresh-cut rose elicits a simple response, but the faded rose
another&#x2014;deeper, sobering, but never &ldquo;depressing,&rdquo; at least not for
me. Here is something from my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> <label id='fnr.31' for='fnr-in.31.7474389' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>31</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.31.7474389' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>31</sup>
Not out yet. Coming&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The new cut rose: initially beautiful, thereafter dried and
desiccated, lost forever its initial delicate beauty and
fragrance. Once affording a glimpse of perfection, only reminiscent
thereafter. Beauty always some fleeting illusion or madness? Moreover
its eclipse, joining, leading the shadows of our relentless doom, our
march to the grave. And though I live in this momentary brilliance, I
still search my night shore; for until now I have known only of
beauty’s haunting rumour, of love’s promise, those slightest
quickenings of things necessarily rare and formerly peripheral. Yes,
in this moment I may have some of love’s bliss, of roses&rsquo; beauty, but
I know I shall cherish with a larger, more settled heart the memories
thereof, echoes sent down life’s long, clouded memory hall as true and
lasting blessings.
</p>

<p>
Yes, I might have received a nod of approval back in the day, perhaps
a pat on the back&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s see another example of Dark get-it-or-don&rsquo;t, this time another
poem from Emily Dickinson, her <i>There&rsquo;s a certain slant of

In the third line, <i>Heft</i> means weight, heaviness; importance,
influence; <i>or</i> (archaic) the greater part or bulk of something.

<div class='verse'><blockquote>

Let that sink in for a while&#x2026; The last line includes <i>Death</i>

Dickinson freely employed the capitalising of nouns for poetic
emphasis.
</span> Again, I must emphasise how these
nineteenth-century artists approached human mortality so differently
than we do today. As I&rsquo;m saying, this past-century view of Death has
largely gone lost. I hope to rediscover it. I&rsquo;ll start by positing
their understanding of Death was integral to their understanding of
Nature&#x2026;

<p>
Travel why to Nature, when she dwells with us? Those who lift their

    &#x2014;Emily Dickinson
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Here are the main points towards a new and much truer understanding of
Nature:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>True nature is the myriad cycles of <i>birth, growth, deterioration,
and death</i> happening constantly everywhere, full stop, nothing
else&#x2026;</li>
<li>&#x2026;ergo, <i>nature is not a place</i>, no indoors versus outdoors, no
here versus there, rather, a state of being, life and death,
existence itself&#x2026;</li>
<li>&#x2026;ergo, no increase or degression of nature, rather, nature
constant ubiquitous&#x2026;</li>
<li>&#x2026;ergo, deterioration and death are integral parts of true Nature.</li>
<li>&#x2026;and so our increasingly extra-natural, pseudo-immortal modern
human flies in the face of, is becoming evermore estranged from true
Nature.</li>
<li>&#x2026;and finally, many Romantic Era poets tapped into real Nature&#x2014;in
contrast to our modern aloof, triumphalist grandiosities, which
amount to a complete estrangement from nature as separate and
locational, thus, &ldquo;held outside&rdquo; and rendered optional.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Real nature is not optional, it just is&#x2014;ubiquitous, unrelenting. I
hold that our modern, twenty-first-century understanding of nature is
very different than <i>Nature</i> of early-nineteenth-century poets such as
William and Dorothy Wordsworth, or John Clare, or the Haworth and
Amherst Emilies.<label id='fnr.34' for='fnr-in.34.4693493' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.34.4693493' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>34</sup>
Again, my shorthand for Emily Brontë and Emily Dickinson is
based on their earthly locations&#x2014;Haworth, West Yorkshire, for the
former and Amherst, Massachusetts, for the latter.
</span> I contend my principals had a unique grasp of
how nature was the ongoing struggle between, the entropic balance of
birth and growth versus deterioration and death. No other creed,
philosophy, religion the world over sensed and comprehended this
cosmic truth better.<label id='fnr.35' for='fnr-in.35.7288065' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.35.7288065' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>35</sup>
Pointedly absent from any sort of modernist poetry is this
underlying sense of true Nature. Of course many celebrated poets of
the late-19th, 20th, and 21st century have waxed deep-impressionistic,
painting lovely impressionistic canvases, but they, alas, just don&rsquo;t get
it&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<p>
For just one example, our modern indoor living environments are more
like modular, sealed <i>space stations</i> plopped down on an alien planet
compared to the simpler, more primitive structures of the
not-so-distant past&#x2026; Quite literally, the Brontës&rsquo; Haworth
parsonage, built in 1778 out of local stone and wood and clay, had
more in common with human shelters from one, <i>two</i> thousand years
previous than with our modern suburban homes only some two hundred
years later.

Hence, <i>in just the past two to three hundred years a very steep,
vertical gradient or differential has grown between so-called indoors
and outdoors</i>. This, in turn, has brought us to see nature more as a
<i>place</i> separate and outside, cut off, away from our artificial,
sterile, high-tech, controlled and regulated modern indoor
spaces<label id='fnr.36' for='fnr-in.36.6487660' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.36.6487660' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>36</sup>
Is it not ironic how nearly all lifeforms that attempt to
share our modern human environments uninvited are considered invasive,
noxious vermin, pests to which we have developed almost hysterical
revulsion?
</span> &#x2026; which, in turn, has lead us to rate <i>nature
outdoors</i> on continua of relative wildness and remoteness from our
sealed-off, self-contained, humans-only environments. And so I ask,
Who is the person in the image above walking down that hall?

<p>
Even as late as my own childhood the term <i>homespun</i> was in use to
indicate a poor, unsophisticated person, a country bumkin, a hick from
the sticks. The term referred to the inferiority of a person&rsquo;s
clothing being homemade from locally-sourced, hand-spun and woven
materials such as linen and wool rather than factory-made retail
clothing. The early-nineteenth century Brontëan West Yorkshire would
have seen the majority of the villagers in homespun, all but a few
garments not hand-tailored bespoke.<label id='fnr.37' for='fnr-in.37.4666375' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.37.4666375' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>37</sup>
Though <i>cotton</i> was rapidly becoming a global commodity, both
cotton and wool fabrics eventually being produced in steam-powered
factories as the Industrial Age reached its inflexion point of growth.
</span> And of course food was
entirely from local production. Hence, a person&rsquo;s daily resources were
overwhelmingly local, a small bit perhaps coming from a nearby <i>market
town</i>, while only the most exotic items (e.g., a clock, a fine musical
instrument) would have come from farther away. Today, however, this
supply pyramid is completely flipped, as nearly everything comes from
far (far!) away (e.g. China), while only a few personal items would be
from a local or even regional source.<label id='fnr.38' for='fnr-in.38.600043' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.38.600043' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>38</sup>
In any modern (non-organic Amazon Whole Foods-style) chain
supermarket I&rsquo;m sure less that 1% of the food items come from a truly
local source. Nearly everything is shipped in from often far afar.
</span> And so in Brontëan times
(first half of the 1800s) much of the surrounding lands were
agriculturally domesticated, a working partner, so to say. Contrast
this with today&rsquo;s urban-suburban populations hardly ever in contact
with farmers or their farms. Nor do we know anything about where our
clothing comes from. Today, &ldquo;the land&rdquo; as our immediate provider has
been completely abstracted into concepts such as <i>ecosystem</i> and
<i>biosphere</i>, which imply we are now removed scientific observers
controlling nature as if it were just another of our mechanical
objects.
</p>

<p>
No doubt we have always made a distinction between being <i>inside</i> a
shelter and going <i>outside</i> into the so-called <i>elements</i>. But
starting some six to ten thousand years ago we began to give up
aboriginal nomadic life and its direct daily contact with said
untamed, uncontrolled elements in order to establish permanent
city-states supported by mass monoculture agriculture. And so indoor
environments in ever-expanding urban centres became increasingly
physically removed, walled off from the wild natural world, becoming
evermore self-contained, all-encompassing, self-referencing, thus,
<i>recursively derivative</i>.<label id='fnr.39' for='fnr-in.39.2765996' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.39.2765996' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>39</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., what is a flower garden but a derivative, a mock-up
of an original place out in the wilds, albeit with the pretty bits
super-amplified idealised, the not-so-pleasant bits left, weeded out?
Again, this is Baudrillard&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality">hyperreality</a>, which we&rsquo;ll discuss below.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Along with this growing separation came mentalities, narratives,
collective social-psychological &ldquo;mindspaces&rdquo; increasingly urban-based,
thus, uniquely <i>extra-natural</i>.<label id='fnr.40' for='fnr-in.40.1803119' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>40</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.40.1803119' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>40</sup>
How often is a Shakespeare character out communing with
nature? Never?&#x2026;
</span> Being so completely indoors
meant we no longer were in direct contact with the aboriginal animist
nature spirits all around; instead, praying to an extra-natural,
off-world monotheistic God in architecturally showcase
churches.<label id='fnr.41' for='fnr-in.41.5679331' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>41</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.41.5679331' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>41</sup>
Churches were typically built in the centre of a town or city
on the highest ground. I once heard that to this day no building in
Vienna may be built taller than the tower of St. Stephen&rsquo;s Cathedral.
</span> Western architecture seemed to reach a fantastical
aesthetic crescendo in the Victorian nineteenth century, ironically
with dark, dense, dramatic Neo-Gothic as one of the a leading
styles. Indeed, seemingly all nineteenth century styles were some
manner of nostalgic revivalist (Greek, Gothic, Italianate,
Elizabethan, Queen Anne, etc.), perhaps hearkening back to times more
integrated with nature, i.e., shallower gradients between indoors and
outdoors. This coincided with the exponential growth in urban
population having just passed an inflection point. And so today we see
the steepness of our indoor-outdoor gradient has accelerated even
more, resulting in a humanity more <i>extra-natural</i> than ever, billions
of people in an all but permanently abstract social-psychological
spaces. How then may we, a species seemingly capable of great
adaptability, measure with any objectivity our separation from nature?
But then what exactly is human adaptability? I posit there are two
sorts of adaptability
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Permanent thus beneficial alteration, or</li>
<li>temporary adjustment, i.e., an allowance for less-that-optimal
conditions, supposing an eventual return to optimal conditions.</li>
</ol>

<p>
We humans, I contend, are the second type of adaptable. And this means
we are not truly adaptable at all, rather, only capable of making
temporary adjustments to bad conditions. Thus, we are certainly no
barometer species or &ldquo;canary in the coal mine&rdquo; of our own
well-being. In fact, <i>we routinely ignore our fellow canary-like
humans</i>, allowing them to suffer and die, their non-adaptations
unheeded if not condemned as weakness. What has domestic, urban,
indoor living done to our brains, our sense of belonging to the
planet, to one another?<label id='fnr.42' for='fnr-in.42.4390980' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>42</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.42.4390980' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>42</sup>

the many rabbit hole bifurcations, the chain of derivatives we&rsquo;ve
taken for all these centuries down and out and away from direct
interaction and response to <i>Natur pur</i>?
</p>

<p>
To be sure, we have demonstrated an amazing collective will to make
conditions better for ourselves <i>and for us alone</i>. We&rsquo;ve set up the
entire planet to be a department store strictly for us, <i>then we&rsquo;ve
looted and ransacked our own department store!</i> We even accept our

sort of exceptionalist, triumphalist destiny. After all, our

Modern human narratives come at us as thousands upon thousands
of fictional novels, films, plays, while aboriginal peoples had myth
and legends timeless and unchanging. That alone&#x2026;
</span> <i>But is this sustainable?</i>
All doomsday spinnings aside, many of us today have grown concerned
over the question of sustainability, concerned about our long arc of
estrangement from nature.<label id='fnr.45' for='fnr-in.45.8147625' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>45</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.45.8147625' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>45</sup>
Is our relatively gradual separation from nature not a perfect
example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog">boiling frog</a> metaphor?
</span> Let me repeat from above a completely
different understanding of nature, namely
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Nature is not a place inside or outside of our human spaces, rather,
nature is everything going on everywhere. Nature is the myriad cycles
of <b>birth</b>, <b>growth</b>, <b>deterioration</b>, and <b>death</b> happening
everywhere all the time.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I contend the Brontës, as well as other Romantic Era poets, knew, or
at least <i>sensed</i> this pre-modern meaning of Nature as above and
beyond inside or outside. Yes, one went <i>outside</i>, out into the
&ldquo;elements.&rdquo; But once back indoors, a Brontë sister was not so
completely out of and above nature&rsquo;s touch, influence, <i>doom</i> (i.e.,
the deterioration and death part) as we now fancy ourselves. Again,
the cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and especially death were
happening everywhere <i>sans emplacement</i>.
</p>

<p>
Consider how the Industrial Revolution created urban production
landscapes vast and barren, vast, seemingly endless landscapes so
completely alien and devoid of any sort of nature, spatial or
otherwise&#x2014;indeed, William Blake&rsquo;s &ldquo;satanic mills.&rdquo; Here is what
German philosopher Ludwig Klages of the late-1800s said
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
The face of the land has become a landscape of coerced
&ldquo;Chicago-ifications&rdquo; as humanity has fallen into an orgy of
destruction without precedence. So-called civilization wears the face
of an unleashed murderer, while the fullness, the bounty of the earth
has withered from his poisonous breath.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And an equally hard-hitter from another German, Günter Grass
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
We already have the statistics for the future: the growth percentages
of pollution, overpopulation, desertification. The future is already
in place.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This was a change on a scale never before seen, a huge and relatively
sudden step away from the physical world as the purveyance of
nature. And even when the modern individual left the confines of an
indoor space, he was still deep within a massive concentration of
extra-natural, human-exclusive structure, logistics, and activity
&#x2026; which made peasant life&#x2014;as hardscrabble as it might have
been&#x2014;in the pre-industrial rural landscape all but idyllic compared
the grueling, grinding poverty of the soul-emptying industrial
cityscapes.<label id='fnr.46' for='fnr-in.46.4122366' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>46</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.46.4122366' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>46</sup>
What became of Wordsworth&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/45560/to-a-highland-girl">To a Highland Girl</a></i> shepherdess
when she and her family were forced into an industrial urban slum? We
can only hope she and her kin are in a better place now&#x2026;
</span> 
</p>

<p>
Here is an excerpt from Emily Brontë&rsquo;s <i>Shall earth no more inspire
thee</i> where Mother Nature speaks directly to the wayward human
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;Thy mind is ever moving<br>
In regions dark to thee;<br>
Recall its useless roving&#x2014;<br>
Come back and dwell with me.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I can never read this poem without having a very emotional
response. Indeed, the house of mirrors echo chamber that modern life
has become blocks Nature and precludes any reality. And so the choice
is simple: We can go back to Nature <i>or</i> continue our useless roving,
which can only lead to evermore alienation&#x2014;from real Nature, as well
as from each other.
</p>

<p>
To be sure, so much ominous and doomsdayish has been said about our
mass society in this modern industrialised world&#x2014;all pointing to the
increasingly obvious fact that our vaunted adaptation skills are being
stretched to the breaking point, collective mental dysphoria
increasing as a total ecological collapse approaches.
</p>

<p>
Here again Emily Brontë, her epic <i>The night is darkening round
me</i><label id='fnr.47' for='fnr-in.47.6213328' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>47</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.47.6213328' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>47</sup>
&#x2026;which we will explore again below&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The night is darkening round me,<br>
The wild winds coldly blow;<br>
But a tyrant spell has bound me,<br>
And I cannot, cannot go.<br>
<br>
The giant trees are bending<br>
Their bare boughs weighed with snow;<br>
The storm is fast descending,<br>
And yet I cannot go.<br>
<br>
Clouds beyond clouds above me,<br>
Wastes beyond wastes below;<br>
But nothing drear can move me;<br>
I will not, cannot go.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This the heart of my darkness. Yes, she is outdoors &ldquo;facing the
elements,&rdquo; as we say. She even refers to the wilds as &ldquo;wastes&rdquo; and as
&ldquo;drear.&rdquo;<label id='fnr.48' for='fnr-in.48.4875638' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>48</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.48.4875638' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>48</sup>
In those days wild, untouched places were often referred to as
wastelands.
</span> And yet she is transfixed, frozen to the spot&#x2014;and
cannot, cannot go. Subjective terms like wastes and drear refer to the
age-old attitudes towards nature as a terrible, grim, inescapable
master, a sponsor of disaster and death, hardly over which to linger,
let alone wax poetic. But surprisingly, my Romantic Era poets did just
that, and to be sure, the grandeur and sublimity of Nature was the
surprising result. Haworth Emily stopped, turned around, and stared
directly at an enemy previously known as all-powerful and unforgiving,
and in so doing she sensed something deep and personally
transformative. <i>She was stirred to write lines that, for me at least,
are the very centre of the mystery of Life, Death, and the Dark Muse.</i>
</p>

<p>
Let us now contrast Brontëan Nature with Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s
twentieth-century take on nature. Hemingway and his contemporaries
rambled hither and yon over the globe trying to find the ultimate
nature experience. He attempted to dominate, to force his will upon
nature to prove his power, his worthiness as a man. I contend this was
at best some strange sacrificial ritual to nature,<label id='fnr.49' for='fnr-in.49.4030850' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.49.4030850' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>49</sup>
Where I live (the Arrowhead region of Northeast Minnesota) we
have two major bike races of over one hundred miles through our
wilderness. Is this some sacrificial, ceremonial ritual to nature?
Indeed, much of our &ldquo;outdoor activities&rdquo; here involve hardship and
discomfort in a sort of &ldquo;rite of passage&rdquo; way.
</span> at worst,
just an act, theatre, creating drama. After all, if anything serious
had happened to him he could have been airlifted out to receive modern
medical care&#x2014;and occasionally was the case.
</p>

<p>
Though not the Romantic Era poets, who lived their entire lives in
harm&rsquo;s way with no timeouts, no escape. Would Hemingway have done all
those chest-pounding, macho-man things if there had been no modern
world with modern medical aid just an airlift away? Haworth Emily
lived in a time when <i>nothing</i> was modern; hence, even her
circumscribed West Yorkshire moorlands were actually a
semi-wilderness. Consider how early eighteenth-century medicine had no
understanding of germs.<label id='fnr.50' for='fnr-in.50.4007355' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>50</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.50.4007355' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>50</sup>
What is generally acknowledged as a clear breakthrough was
John Snow&rsquo;s tracing of the London cholera outbreak of 1854 back to
certain London neighborhood public wells. This was strong proof of
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germ_theory_of_disease">contagion theory</a>. However, it wasn&rsquo;t until the late nineteenth
century that Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur established the field of
bacteriology and our modern scientific understanding of microscopic
pathogens finally developed.
</span> Quite literally, a cut on a toe could
become infected, resulting in amputation, even death in those
times. Nature for a Brontë sister was not a contest, a rite of
passage, a show or game on a borrowed fresh-air stage. They weren&rsquo;t
out to prove anything to a modern audience.

With Nature as countless cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
death going on all around us, the last two components, deterioration

<p>
Back in the day, Death was a <i>force majeure</i>&#x2014;but no longer thanks to
modern medicine. It&rsquo;s almost as if deterioration and Death, two of
nature&rsquo;s supposedly inescapable realities, have been cordoned off&#x2014;or
at least placed under much greater human control than ever
before. <i>It&rsquo;s as if through modern medicine we have begun to acquire a
demi-godlike, proto-immortal veto power over physical demise.</i> And
with this control we have begun to tear down, dismantle a great
component of spirituality, namely the reckoning of one&rsquo;s mortality
with a deity, with an afterlife. Where once was supposed a <i>mortal</i>,
physical plane inferior to an <i>immortal</i> spiritual plane, we now would
believe only the physical plane relevant, we, of course, its eventual
total masters. But with this hubris comes a great psychic and spiritual
impoverishment, the extent of which we do not fully realise.
Allow me another Amherst Emily quote
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Life is Death we&rsquo;re lengthy at<br>
Death the hinge to Life<br>

<p>
For the meantime, however, death still remains an undeniable
certainty. Death comes as it always has&#x2014;from old age, fatal
accident, or deadly physical aggression or predation.<label id='fnr.52' for='fnr-in.52.6902977' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>52</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.52.6902977' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>52</sup>
For critters, predators are other bigger critters. For humans,
predators are&#x2014;outside of war and homicidal aggression&#x2014;all

</span> But a
completely different attitude arises when modern healthcare&rsquo;s
labyrinth of diagnoses, drugs, procedures, surgeries, <i>interventions</i>
routinely thwart what was once all but a certain, if not swift
demise. We have seriously disrupted the schedule of Death, and so we&rsquo;ve
begun to lessen the mystery of Death, overturn fate, consequence, and
doom. We&rsquo;ve become lengthier at life, oiling and oiling Dickenson&rsquo;s

cheap, sentimental gimmickry.
</span> And so I say,
as Death is interrupted, so are the greater human cycles of emotion
and spirituality interrupted &#x2026; meaning if Death is also adjustable,
as Emily Dickinson said it <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i>, then we are slashing blindly at
the very fabric of reality.

<p>
Indeed, what if we start to take over Death&rsquo;s appointment book,
rerouting, rescheduling Death&rsquo;s comings and goings? Psalm 90:10 is
making the point that by no means are we guaranteed seventy or eighty
years of life, and even if we get them they might not be that
great. And yet we have grown to <i>expect</i> from the implicit promises of
modern medical science a healthy, high-quality seventy, eighty,
ninety, or even more years. Again, modern medicine has disrupted the
two last components of Nature ubiquitous cyclic, i.e., deterioration
and death, thereby further collapsing our understanding of what true
Nature is. Modern science has lessened, confused, disrupted the wallop
of tragedy, weakened the overall doominess of doom by redefining life
as just so much carbon-based machine circuitry, a mechanism that is to
be better and better repaired, maintained, improved against entropic
wear-and-tear&#x2014;until we are literally immortal.<label id='fnr.55' for='fnr-in.55.3978722' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>55</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.55.3978722' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>55</sup>

Allow me to relate a modern story touching on our new attitude towards

lung cancer inevitably caused by decades of smoking.<label id='fnr.56' for='fnr-in.56.8368647' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>56</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.56.8368647' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>56</sup>
Ironically, both of his previous wives had likewise died from
smoking-related illnesses.
</span> But
instead of accepting this, he became angry and accused her doctors of
malpractice, threatening lawsuits. Nothing came of this, but I
wondered why such an irrational outburst from a college-educated man?
I eventually theorised that from all the buzz surrounding the various
possible medical interventions&#x2014;including their probabilities of
success or failure&#x2014;he had begun to expect the death sentence of lung
cancer could, <i>should</i> be beaten by some technology lurking in some
corner of the modern medical mega-factory. Death was not the
long-anticipated reunion with the Creator, rather, a trigger of enmity
and recriminations over the failure of scientific procedures and
medications. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Back in the day, no one would have second-guessed Death&rsquo;s arrival to
such an absurd degree. Again, human life was like a boat with shallow
gunwales, the waves of Death <i>expected</i> to lap over at any time. But
today the fourscore years spoken of in Psalms has become an implicitly
guaranteed minimum. Old age and death are increasingly spoken of as
&ldquo;diseases&rdquo; we can and should defeat. Death as a nuisance, indeed. My
father felt cheated when that three-, fourscore and more was not
forthcoming for his wife. But as you may anticipate, I contend life is
truly life only with Death&#x2014;Death absolute and not easily pushed
back, much less manipulated or obviated.

</span> These thinkers rallied around
Novalis, whom they adopted as a sort of naïf mascot, spring-boarding
from <i>HttN</i> and Novalis&rsquo; <i>poetising</i>, another term he used for the
romanticising of life. Indeed, what came to be known as Jena
Romanticism<label id='fnr.64' for='fnr-in.64.7314257' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>64</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.64.7314257' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>64</sup>

of the main objectives of WutheringUK is to wrest Romanticism and
especially Dark away from the ivory tower humanities &ldquo;scholars.&rdquo;
</span> spread to eager circles and fertile grounds
throughout the West. They raised Novalis&rsquo; idealisations of
<i>Poesie</i> <label id='fnr.65' for='fnr-in.65.47737' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>65</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.65.47737' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>65</sup>
The German <i>Poesie</i> is typically translated as simply
<i>poetry</i>; however, poetry as a concept beyond just the literary art,
more towards the older <i>poesy</i> perhaps.
</span> as an all-embracing paradigm to counter the cold,
dehumanising, thus <i>desensitising</i> implications of Enlightenment Age
rationalism and determinism, as well as the stultifying formalisms, as
well as triumphalist imperialism of Classicism. Novalis sounded the
charge to <i>re-sensitise</i> the human being. Here is a quote about one of
the Jena Set&rsquo;s central figures, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Wilhelm_Schlegel">August Schlegel</a> to give a quick
preliminary idea of what German Romanticism was about&#x2014;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
It is widely accepted that the Romantic Movement in Germany emerged,
on the one hand, as a reaction against the aesthetical ideals defended
in Classicism and Neoclassicism, and on the other, as a deviation from
the rational principles of the Enlightenment with the consequent
regression to the irrational spirit of the Middle Ages.
</p>

<p>
Schlegel argues that, from a philosophical point of view, everything
participates in an ongoing process of creation, whereas, from an
empirical point of view, natural things are conceived as if they were
dead, fixed and independent from the whole.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alas, but here is where I become quite the iconoclast, primarily by
insisting <i>academe has Romanticism wrong!</i> Even Novalis&rsquo;
supporters, his Jena contemporaries, yes, even Novalis himself seemed
to lose the thread and march about spouting dessicated
intellectualisations.<label id='fnr.66' for='fnr-in.66.7297817' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>66</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.66.7297817' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>66</sup>
If you must, read <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/novalis/">this about Novalis</a>, which is as good as
any. But as academe is wont to do, it hangs on every word uttered and
written by a young man in his twenties feeling his way along. This
approach may work with Bohr and Einstein, but not with a
twenty-something poet&#x2026;
</span> <i>I posit that Novalis with his
foundational HttN took off like a sleepwalker towards the Dark
Muse</i>. However, Romanticism, as subsequently cooked up by &ldquo;experts&rdquo;
during and after, became a bloated, overanalysed, theory-bound,
cart-before-the-horse disaster. Or I will simply say, German
Romanticism began true but veered off into the ditch&#x2014;all while
Wordsworthian English Romanticism never really emphasised Dark with
much intention, except for Coleridge&rsquo;s gothic borrowings from the
eighteenth century.<label id='fnr.67' for='fnr-in.67.9966157' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>67</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.67.9966157' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>67</sup>

<p>
I contend my principal poets were like a great river broken into
multiple braided channels across a broad landscape with little to
intellectualise about other than wetness. And so my whole point with
WutheriingUK is to urge you to simply <b>read, sigh, reflect&#x2014;repeat</b>
the lines writtien by my principals (Brontës, Dickinson, Poe, Keats,
Wordsworth, Clare, et al.) and not follow any of the scholarly
technocrats down their musty, mildewy rabbit holes where the spirit of
it all quickly suffocates. Of course this may seem naive, context-free
and amateurish of me, but the alternative is winding up lost and
clueless as I believe the vast majority of Romanticism scholars
are. Academe Romanticism is truly the blind leading the blind. Duly
warned, let&rsquo;s get into <i>HttN</i> and why it is so important.
</p>

<p>
Reading <i>HttN</i> one cannot escape the sheer intensity of Novalis&rsquo;
swoon-fest over Night and Death. Here is a small taste
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I feel the flow of<br>
Death&rsquo;s youth-giving flood;<br>
To balsam and æther, it<br>
Changes my blood!<br>
I live all the daytime<br>
In faith and in might:<br>
And in holy rapture<br>
I die every night.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
and just before came
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
What delight, what pleasure offers <i>thy</i> life, to outweigh the transports of Death? Wears not everything that inspirits us the livery of the Night? Thy mother, it is she brings thee forth, and to her thou owest all thy glory.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
It my opinion <i>HttN</i> is one of the densest, purest, most direct
attesting to the Dark Muse ever.<label id='fnr.68' for='fnr-in.68.1262755' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>68</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.68.1262755' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>68</sup>
And yet <i>HttN</i> wasn&rsquo;t entirely new after all. Soon will be
discussed similar offerings from the eighteenth century.
</span> As the legend tells, his
inspiration came from being grief-stricken at the death of his
fifteen-year-old fiancée Sophie von Kühn,<label id='fnr.69' for='fnr-in.69.5307921' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>69</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.69.5307921' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>69</sup>
Sophie von Kühn <br>
<img src="images/Sophie_von_Kühn.jpg" alt="Sophie_von_Kühn.jpg"> <br>
<br>
</span> to whose grave he
made a pilgrimage for one hundred nights. The Jena Set writer Ludwig
Tieck described the teenage Sophie
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Even as a child, she gave an impression which&#x2014;because it was so
gracious and spiritually lovely&#x2014;we must call super-earthly or
heavenly, while through this radiant and almost transparent
countenance of hers we would be struck with the fear that it was too
tender and delicately woven for this life, that it was death or
immortality which looked at us so penetratingly from those shining
eyes; and only too often a rapid withering motion turned our fear into
an actual reality.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, Sophie was the mascot of the mascot, an angelic being of
singular feminine mystique inspiring great feelings and words.<label id='fnr.70' for='fnr-in.70.2709316' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>70</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.70.2709316' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>70</sup>
We&rsquo;ll dive into Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s very similar idealisations
in what is possibly his most popular poem <i>Annabel Lee</i> below.
</span>
And it was her death that threw Novalis into a state of mind which, in
turn, proved to be the catalyst for so many others. But as I must
insist, <i>HttN</i> was not just the gymnastics of flipping the sacred to
profane, the profane to sacred as Novalis himself described
romanticising poetising. He journeyed into Night and came back with
some of the most compelling Dark ever. But immediately thereafter
there yawned open a great abyss between the actual talent, the
producers on the one hand and describer-promoters on the other, i.e.,
Novalis&rsquo; friends who became known as the Jena Romanticists. We&rsquo;ll
explore why so many of Novalis&rsquo; contemporaries and nearly all of his
researchers did not &ldquo;get&rdquo; his Dark.

<img src="images/SamuelTaylorColeridge.jpg" alt="SamuelTaylorColeridge.jpg"> <br>
</span> is generally accepted as the leading
intellectualiser of early British Romanticism, its inception roughly
parallel to the Jena Romantic liftoff. Following is a Coleridge quote
as good as any
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;first, that two forces should be conceived which counteract each
other by their essential nature; not only not in consequence of the
accidental direction of each, but as prior to all direction, nay, as
the primary forces from which the conditions of all possible
directions are derivative and deducible: secondly, that these forces
should be assumed to be both alike infinite, both alike
indestructible&#x2026; this one power with its two inherent indestructible
yet counteracting forces, and the results or generations to which
their inter-penetration gives existence, in the living principle and
the process of our own self-consciousness.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Indeed, such wordy intellectualisations are the usual fodder seized
upon by latter-day academes whipping up their own word salad
copy. Yes, Coleridge and Wordsworth&rsquo;s <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> is considered
the cornerstone of English Romanticism with its clearly poetising of
Nature. But as I say, these men do not seem to possess dark
proclivities or feel much inclined to express the Dark Muse&#x2014;least of
all Coleridge.
</p>

<p>
Now, let us consider what English poet John Keats said years
later in a 1817 letter to his brothers George and Thomas
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
&#x2026;I mean <b>Negative Capability</b>, that is, when a man is capable of
being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable
reaching after fact and reason&#x2014;Coleridge, for instance, would let go
by a fine isolated verisimilitude caught from the Penetralium of
mystery, from being incapable of remaining content with
half-knowledge. This pursued through volumes would perhaps take us no
further than this, that with a great poet the sense of Beauty
overcomes every other consideration, or rather obliterates all
consideration.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Keats repudiates hard and fast ideas battling it out for
supremacy. Intellectualisations, great and lengthy, especially of the
&ldquo;Penetralium<label id='fnr.72' for='fnr-in.72.8454595' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>72</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.72.8454595' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>72</sup>
<b>penetralium</b>: (plural <i>penetralia</i>) the innermost (or most

<b>verisimilar</b>: having the appearance of truth.
</span>
ramblings to him. Indeed, to <i>not</i> immediately intellectualise, but to
hold oneself in that maddeningly counter-intuitive suspended state of
unresolved&#x2014;just to see where it might lead&#x2014;is Keats&rsquo; great
insight. Feelings and impressions and what-ifs must be gently,
carefully raised up out of the mental ruckus. To be sure, <i>Negative
Capability</i> is about living with <i>cognitive dissonance</i>, that such
frustrations is the great and necessary burden the poet must carry, a
mental control technique key towards deeper insights and
understanding. And so the poet must fly beyond the neat and tidy piles
of logical-seeming words to reach a higher place. Keats obviates any
and all academic intellectualisms with his simple ode to Beauty. Here
is the famed beginning of his &ldquo;poetic romance&rdquo; <i>Endymion</i><label id='fnr.74' for='fnr-in.74.9319795' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>74</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.74.9319795' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>74</sup>

In the 2009 film <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bright_Star_(film)">Bright Star</a></i>, a touching verisimilar bio-drama about
Keats, there is a scene where, speaking to his love interest Fanny
Brawne, he says
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A poet is not at all poetical. In fact, he the most unpoetical thing
in existence. He has no identity. He is continually filling some other
body&#x2014;the sun, the moon&#x2026; Poetic craft is a carcass, a
sham. <b>If poetry does not come as naturally as leaves to a tree then
it had better not come at all</b>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#x2026;and then Fanny says, <i>I still don&rsquo;t know how to work out a poem.</i>
To which Keats says<label id='fnr.75' for='fnr-in.75.2146037' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>75</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.75.2146037' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>75</sup>

</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving
in a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore but to be in the
lake, to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not <i>work</i> the
lake out. It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and
emboldens the soul to accept mystery.

<p>
And thus I would posit he did not see Romanticism as something needs
bundling and explaining and stuck with labels and herded into
categories. The point of hearing birdsong is not to think about male
birds warding off other males whilst trying to appeal to females, but
to luxuriate in the wonderful chorus of nature.<label id='fnr.76' for='fnr-in.76.8661255' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>76</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.76.8661255' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>76</sup>

</span> Time and time
again I listen to or read a description of Romanticism and come away
feeling how the scholar understood nothing qualitatively, rather, is
simply stringing disparate bits and bobs together towards some
verisimilitude of penetralia they don&rsquo;t really get or understand. And
so I say the intellectual prison in which academe has stuck
Romanticism should be opened up, the guards soundly switched and run
off, the prisoners let back out into the wide fields and deep woods
where they might be beyond thought.

<i>The Genius of Instinct; Reclaim Mother Nature&rsquo;s Tools for
Enhancing Your Health, Happiness, Family, and Work</i> by Hendrie
Weisinger; 2009; Pearson Education, Inc.
</span> author and psychologist
Hendrie Weisinger insists we are hard-wired by nature to seek out the
best conditions in order to <i>thrive</i>, that any life other than one of
maximal thriving is time and energy wasted. He uses the example of
bats, which, according to research, have been observed to seek out
human buildings, preferring them over natural nesting in rock
outcrops, hollow trees, or caves. And in so doing, they enjoy
advantages such as better body temperature regulation, lower infant
mortality, less threat of predation. This may be true, <i>but wait</i>,
haven&rsquo;t these bats jumped <i>outside</i> of the original constraints where
they once were completely integrated with nature? These advantaged
bats are now in a state of <i>trans</i>-bat-ism. But is this good for
nature as a whole? In effect, the bats have short-circuited their
doom, their fate. And so I ask, what are the real long-term
consequences of this cheat?
</p>

<p>
Perhaps bats doing marginally better is not too much of an imbalance
vis-a-vis the rest of their competitors and surrounding
environment.<label id='fnr.78' for='fnr-in.78.6718615' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>78</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.78.6718615' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>78</sup>
Here in woodsy Minnesota we haven&rsquo;t noticed a shortage of
mosquitoes, one of bats&rsquo; primary food sources.
</span> But what happens when a species keeps on
&ldquo;thriving&rdquo; more and more, increasing its success statistics, stepping
over, beyond any of the natural restrictions that <i>total</i> integration
and harmony with nature would have required? <i>Aren&rsquo;t we humans Exhibit
A of just such an out-of-control species?</i> And so I ask, how can all
this so-called thriving be good, end well?  How can a dominant species
like ours&#x2014;which always seems to be &ldquo;gaming the system,&rdquo; using the
entire planet as our exclusive, one-species department store, evermore
ingeniously and aggressively extra-natural&#x2014;not eventually have to
pay some price?  Simply put, How can more and more people consuming
more and more resources and energy, each of us full of fantasies about
success and prosperity, not result in an eventual overshoot disaster?
</p>

<p>
Nature seems to have two and only two models: A) steady-state
niche/stasis and B) exponential, dynamic growth. And whenever a
species is not restricted to, locked down in its tightly integrated
niche, then exponential growth ensues&#x2014;which eventually must hit an
inflexion point and take off dramatically and uncontrollably towards
an inevitable overshoot and crash.
</p>

<p>
I bring this up because, to my mind, Emily Brontë was just this sort
of hard-pressed little bat out in the wilds&#x2014;colony-less, huddled
under a rock, barely eking out a marginal life. Here is her <i>Plead for
me</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Why I have persevered to shun<br>
The common paths that others run;<br>
And on a strange road journeyed on<br>
Heedless alike of Wealth and Power—<br>
Of Glory’s wreath and Pleasure’s flower.<br>
<br>
These once indeed seemed Beings divine,<br>
And they perchance heard vows of mine<br>
And saw my offerings on their shrine—<br>
But, careless gifts are seldom prized,<br>
And mine were worthily despised;<br>
<br>
My Darling Pain that wounds and sears<br>
And wrings a blessing out from tears<br>
By deadening me to real cares;<br>
And yet, a king&#x2014;though prudence well<br>
Have taught thy subject to rebel.<br>
<br>
And am I wrong to worship where<br>
Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,<br>
Since my own soul can grant my prayer?<br>
Speak, God of Visions, plead for me<br>
And tell why I have chosen thee!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
It doesn&rsquo;t sound like Emily was &ldquo;living her best life&rdquo; in the modern
sense. I consider this her ode to skipping the unnatural trans-human
thrive scene of her day and striking out into some Beyond to commune
with her God of Visions. Again, I must believe she was a little bat
fluttering across the semi-wilderness moorland, a true existential
<i>underdog</i> definitely <i>not</i> thriving, rather, a quasi-equal of all the
other underdog wild critters, as was still marginally possible back
then.
</p>

<p>
Compare this with today&rsquo;s outdoor adventurer who, clad in &ldquo;technical&rdquo;
gear from REI, Patagonia, North Face, drives to government set-aside
wilds such as the Smokies mentioned above in a four-wheel-drive Jeep
Cherokee, consumes protein bars and electrolyte drinks, listens to
appropriate New Age music with earbuds, takes smart phone pictures and
GoPro videos. Any serious mishaps? Call for immediate helicopter
rescue on the iPhone satellite connection&#x2026; At some point we&rsquo;re just
amateur Earth astronauts like Katy Perry on a Blue Origin flight into
sub-space, no? When nature is truly in balance, <i>all</i> participants are
underdogs to some degree. But not us modern humans. We have demanded
and gained all but total dominance over nature. We see ourselves above
and beyond nature. But where does that leave us? Outside of nature
looking in, looking back, babbling on with borrowed New Age spiritual
grandiosities, pretending to have some connection that was severed
long ago. Imagine a divorced man who calls his ex-wife daily. This is
us with nature.
</p>

<p>
Emily Brontë died of anorexia-induced malnutrition, contaminated
water, tuberculosis&#x2014;pick one, two, or all three&#x2014;five months after
her thirtieth birthday. She only saw the greater world outside of her
tiny Haworth village and its surrounding hills for a few
months.<label id='fnr.79' for='fnr-in.79.1555251' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>79</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.79.1555251' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>79</sup>
&#x2026;a stay in Belgium to learn French and a short-lived gig in
nearby Halifax as a governess.
</span> As I said above, hers was a world containing nothing
modern as we know it, e.g., a simple cut could lead to an infection
requiring amputation, or even worse.
</p>

<p>
Though it may seem counterintuitive to claim her existence in early
nineteen century West Yorkshire was as wild and rugged, as
back-to-nature as, say, homesteaders today on some remote Canadian
wilderness river. Was she still not observing nature from a
long-established civilised place of safety, thereby rendering her
observations just as tainted, just as removed and relativistic as ours
today? I say no. Clearly our modern, quasi-Earth astronaut perch of
high-tech materialism is many orders of magnitude greater than hers,
such that even our wildest, remotest places today are not nearly as
threatening, as precarious as was her own moolands. Just consider how
today each of us consumes upwards of <i>one hundred times</i> the resources
and energy (i.e., per capita) as did one of our European ancestors
from Emily&rsquo;s time. As I contend, <i>the bigger the dance floor has
grown, the more spastic, the more abstract, the crazier the dancing
has become</i>. I see a direct correlation between resource
liberalisation and social liberalism&#x2014;and thus the abstractions and
phantasms, the feeling of being lost in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">The Matrix</a></i> we experience
today. I contend my Haworth Emily&rsquo;s was a unique vantage point in a
special place and time, neither too exposed to nor removed from
elemental nature. I contend pre-Roman Yorkshire and Brontëan Yorkshire
were more alike technologically, socially, look-and-feel than Brontëan
Yorkshire and today&rsquo;s Yorkshire just some two hundred years later.
</p>

<p>
And yet I&rsquo;m often confronted with modern scoffers who must believe
Romantic Era poets only knew nature from picnics held at country
estates where dandies and their pampered ladies were attended by
servants, as seen, e.g., in Hollywood film versions of Jane
Austen<label id='fnr.80' for='fnr-in.80.2066384' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>80</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.80.2066384' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>80</sup>
Sadly enough, there is nothing really otherworldly Dark or
Romanticist as I know it about Jane Austen. She was seemingly devoid,
non-pursuant of Dostoyevski&rsquo;s POEH. Although she once did say,
&ldquo;Pictures of perfection, as you know, make me sick and wicked.&rdquo;
(Letter to her niece Fanny Knight, 23 March 1817.) Otherwise, we know
nothing of any dark inclinations she might have had.
</span>
</p>

<p>
And of course, they pile up facts and figures about how deprived and
downtrodden the common man was back then. Against all this I will not
argue, so missing the point as they are. Again, for us moderns, nature is
a <i>place</i>, a <i>location</i> away from and diametrically opposite our
modern space-station-like interior worlds. For us nature picks up
somewhere &ldquo;outdoors,&rdquo; past our suburbs and out behind our agri-factory
farmlands, eventually becoming something we call the <i>Great
Outdoors</i>. And so the farther afield from modern civilization we can
go, the more authentic, the truer and wilder nature supposedly
becomes. And so we create a <i>nature continuum</i> whereby a presumably
untouched, trackless wilderness as far from civilization as possible
is the truest nature, while hardly nature at all would be that weedy
ditch behind our triple-paned windowed, vinyl-siding-clad,
forced-air-HVAC suburban house. But let me again be blunt: We do not
get more nature simply because we have gone like exploring astronauts
ever farther out from our sterile, artificial exclusively human home
base. Nature is not something close or remote, rather, <i>Nature is
everywhere all the time</i>.
</p>

<p>
It is precisely because we have spoiled so much of our immediate
nature that we elevate far-afield wilderness regions to a practically
sacred, quasi-off-planet status. This is why writers like Ernest
Hemingway and Jack London exploit fright memes in describing distant,
exotic, hostile places like the Yukon and Africa &#x2026; indeed, virtually
identical to science fiction stories of strange, hostile, dangerous,
alien planets conquered by brave, intrepid astronauts. Now, where does
that get us?
</p>

<p>
And so I insist my poets of the so-called Romantic Era were not
pampered dandies with their fine ladies strolling for a few bored
minutes on manicured estate grounds, all while servants lived in
abject misery. Nor were they &ldquo;white privilege&rdquo; beneficiaries of the
&ldquo;Age of Exploration&rdquo; colonialism. My poets were mainly short-lived
little bats in their crevasses and corners, as hard-pressed as any
bats have ever been.

As alluded above, the world was seeing Dark, exploring dark
proclivities decades before Novalis and German Romanticism,
specifically eighteenth-century Britain and what might be called its
<i>gothic movement</i> starting off with the doom-and-gloom <i>Graveyard
School</i> of poetry. After Graveyard, just past mid-century, came the
<i>gothic novel</i> full force with its direct, if not formulaic
doom-and-gloom. But then came what might be called the <i>Night School</i>,
which became the basis of my dark corner of Romanticism. Again, the
grave as inspiration&#x2014;

It was only a few decades into the eighteenth century, many decades
before Wordsworth or Novalis, when there emerged in Britain a style of
poetry which has since been named the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_poets">Graveyard School</a></i>. As I do with
Novalis and his <i>HttN</i>, I can&rsquo;t help but believe these English
Graveyarders were more sleepwalkers than any sort of intentional
movement leaders. My Exhibit A of Graveyard is Edward Young&rsquo;s
epic-length <i><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/33156/33156-h/33156-h.htm">The Complaint: or, Night-Thoughts on Life, Death, &amp;
Immortality</a></i> (or simply <i>Night-Thoughts</i>, ca. 1742-1745).<label id='fnr.81' for='fnr-in.81.8520723' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>81</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.81.8520723' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>81</sup>

</span>
Bursting with a grandiosity best provided by poetry, Young
relentlessly spins out darkness and doom. To be sure, he is Dark with
a shudder, full of fright memes meant to weigh down and ultimately
crush&#x2013;if we take him seriously. A quick taste
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
"When the cock crew, he wept”&#x2014;smote by that eye<br>
Which looks on me, on all: that Power, who bids<br>
This midnight sentinel, with clarion shrill<br>
(Emblem of that which shall awake the dead),<br>
Rouse souls from slumber, into thoughts of heaven.<br>
Shall I too weep? Where then is fortitude?<br>
And, fortitude abandon’d, where is man?<br>
I know the terms on which he sees the light;<br>
He that is born, is listed; life is war;<br>
Eternal war with woe. Who bears it best,<br>
Deserves it least&#x2026;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
&#x2026;indeed, life eternal war with unrelenting woe. Typical of Graveyard
School, there is no hope, no escape, just the weight of an assumed
curse (ultimately original sin?), then processions of lamentation to
cliff edges and the fated tumbling thereoff. Reading further
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Art, brainless Art! our furious charioteer&#x2026;<br>

<p>
Don&rsquo;t put away your hip-waders yet

From wave to wave of fancied misery<br>
At random drove&#x2026;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I just hate it when dreams infest my grave, don&rsquo;t you? Of course every
student of the Dark Muse should read Young&rsquo;s <i>Night-thoughts</i>. But as
I say, this over-the-top doom hyperbole will eventually deliver even
the most indulgent reader to incredulity. Dare I say at some point it
becomes farce.<label id='fnr.82' for='fnr-in.82.2682680' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>82</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.82.2682680' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>82</sup>
YMMV. Personally, I like a good doom-and-gloom session, and
Young really delivers with <i>Night Thoughts</i>. Later we&rsquo;ll go into Emily
Brontë&rsquo;s take on doom-and-gloom and her more measured Christian
perspective.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Though Graveyard had a more contemplative, measured side. For example,
Thomas Gray&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44299/elegy-written-in-a-country-churchyard">Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard</a></i> (1751) treats
our intellect with more respect. To be sure, eulogising the dead is a
much older and well established genre, typically emphasising the
qualities of the deceased over the dark, eternal abyss his grave might
represent. If we are meant to succumb to Young&rsquo;s relentless pounding,
Gray&rsquo;s elegy of a lost friend is Dark and fatalist and yet reverent
and faithful
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Large was his bounty, and his soul sincere,<br>
Heav&rsquo;n did a recompense as largely send:<br>
He gave to Mis&rsquo;ry all he had, a tear,<br>

</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
With Gray whatever woefulness, doom may be swirling about, God in his
heavenly domain still has our backs. In short, Gray does not beat us
down as much as did the hardcore Graveyard Schoolers.
</p>

<p>
Whence this proto-Dark? Was there something Dark before? Or was it
simply in the air? As I insist about the Dark Muse in general,
Graveyard arrived unexpectedly, a natural, organic
upwelling&#x2014;notwithstanding its heavy and oppressive. Which begs the
question, How does Dark rise to cultural and intellectual prominence
in an age?<label id='fnr.83' for='fnr-in.83.474339' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>83</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.83.474339' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>83</sup>
&#x2026;that is, in a past age not exposed to the science of modern
public relations. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays">this</a> about Edward Bernays and the birth of
modern advertising and public relations. TL;DR: Since Bernays, no
&ldquo;movement&rdquo; in our modern times can be considered natural and organic,
rather, the result of somebody&rsquo;s financed public relations campaign.
</span> To be sure, many of that era condemned gothic and
Graveyard as unworthy subculture. But eventually came refinement,
which I might call the <i>Night School</i>. Though intervening was the
<i>gothic novel</i>, which we must now investigate.<label id='fnr.84' for='fnr-in.84.1106891' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>84</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.84.1106891' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>84</sup>
&#x2026;but the Germans were not idle during this time, either. I
should also mention Gottfried August Bürger&rsquo;s very popular and often
translated into English epic poem <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenore_(ballad)">Lenore</a></i> from 1774.

Prose versus poetry. In the past, poetry was seen by members of polite
society as the higher, the acceptable form of literature. For example,
Germany has long been referred to as the land of <i>poets</i> and
thinkers.<label id='fnr.85' for='fnr-in.85.704363' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>85</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.85.704363' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>85</sup>

Two terms, <i>novel</i> (English) and <i>roman</i> (French, German,
etc. from the adjectival <i>Roman</i>, <i>Roman-like</i>) came to describe any
long-form prose story-telling.
</span> on the other
hand, was looked down on, seen as too revealing invasive personal,
i.e., it would be improper, unseemly, distasteful to expose even an
imaginary person&rsquo;s life details in such an open and revealing
fashion. And so according to this attitude, it was considered crude to
so freely fantasise human goings-on in a fictitious way. Preferable
for literature to ennoble the human as a being created in the likeness
of God, hence, let us not dwell on his mundanity and failings. After
all, a novel was neither factual (e.g. a saint&rsquo;s hagiography) nor high
lyrical poetic (e.g., church hymn lyrics or <i>Heldenlieder</i>). A
novel/roman was simply too plain-spoken, i.e., the unavoidable clarity
of straight descriptive writing invariably generated an undesirable
ordinariness. And so it was in this social climate that the prose
novel bumped along into post-Medieval Age as a tolerated, sometimes
useful corruption of writing, a regrettable parallel to poetry,
consumed mainly, as it was said, by arriviste vulgarian middle-class
women. But as the middle class grew in power and numbers, the
novel came to the fore, especially in the eighteenth century.<label id='fnr.87' for='fnr-in.87.9614924' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>87</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.87.9614924' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>87</sup>
Ironically, the <i>Novella</i>, a long short-story format with no
chapter breaks, was better tolerated in Germany.
</span>
</p>

<p>
Modern academe considers the novel <i>The Castle of Otranto, A Gothic
Story</i>, appearing in its first edition in 1764, to be the official
start of British <i>gothic</i> literature.<label id='fnr.88' for='fnr-in.88.7120933' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>88</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.88.7120933' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>88</sup>
One giveaway is <i>gothic</i> in the title. Perhaps read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_fiction">this
overview</a> of Gothic fiction.
</span> Written by the excentric,
iconoclastic English nobleman Horace Walpole (1717 – 1797), <i>Otranto</i>
is a fantastical melodrama set in sixteenth-century Naples offering
the slumming, darkly-inclined readers of the day a big dose of
darkness, doom, and woe. Walpole&rsquo;s penchant for medievalism rode a
long-simmering nostalgic idealisation of the Medieval Age.<label id='fnr.89' for='fnr-in.89.9020498' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>89</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.89.9020498' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>89</sup>
Walpole initially claimed <i>Otranto</i> to be a medieval
manuscript he had discovered and translated, when all along it had
been his own creation.
</span>
While the adjective <i>gothic</i> referred to medieval Gothic architecture,
this is ironic since the label Gothic had previously been used
pejoratively in the Renaissance alluding to the destructive barbarian
nature of the Goths, that is to say, Gothic architecture was crude and

<p>
Above is an etching from a publication of Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bride_of_Lammermoor">The
Bride of Lammermore</a></i> (1819). Consider the sheer visual density and
heaviness of the scene (click on the image to be taken to a larger
version). <i>Whence, wherefore</i> this heaviness, this portent?
Predominant is Nature being Dark in an inhospitable, threatening
way. The human-built castle is primitive, isolated, and
vulnerable. The riders are miniscule, exposed&#x2026; It&rsquo;s as if every
single living cell&#x2014;plant, animal, human&#x2014;is clinging to life by a
thread, and any dim green and blue hues of vegetation and sea are
wholly irrelevant. The scene evokes danger, dysphoria, as if surely
something horrific is just waiting to transpire. But again how, why?
Why did such darkness emerge and what was (and still is) the appeal?
Hitchcock tautologies aside,<label id='fnr.91' for='fnr-in.91.7235665' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>91</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.91.7235665' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>91</sup>
Hitchcock was once asked why he thought his horror films were
so popular. He replied, &ldquo;From time to time the man on the street likes
to dip his toe in the lake of horror.&rdquo;
</span> modern academe has offered
theories about the socio-political-psychological landscape of the
times, and yet these experts only sound supercilious and patronising
from their modern triumphalist perches, as if they are searching for a
disease to explain a malady, weakness to explain indulgence. No,
indeed, Dark, even when crude and heavy, arrests, mystifies,
predominates, the appeal all the stronger for its recessive,
ungraspable spherical symmetry. To be sure, this &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; of
gothic in the eighteenth century was overwrought, indulgent with its
fright memes, but undeniably popular and onto something real about the
inner human experience&#x2014;at least to the Western world of those times.
</p>

<p>
The popularity of the gothic novel continued throughout the nineteenth
and into the twentieth century primarily in the romance genre&#x2014;after
the term romance had evolved to mean love.<label id='fnr.92' for='fnr-in.92.2835404' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>92</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.92.2835404' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>92</sup>

Novelist Ann Radcliffe (1764 - 1823) could be said to be the first to
gain respectability for gothic fiction. Upper-middle-class and
spanning the proto-Romantic late-eighteenth century into the Romantic
Era, she forged a broad readership in the risen middle class for her
moral and otherwise high-brow treatment of gothic
gloom-and-doom. Again, a certain shade of Dark beyond cheap fright
devices was evolving and Radcliffe was a part of it.

The three most popular novels written by the Brontë sisters---<i>Jane
Eyre</i> by Charlotte, <i>Wuthering Heights</i> by Emily, and <i>The Tenant of
Wildfell Hall</i> by Anne&#x2014;are usually considered to be gothic, and
therefore, at least according to my logic, flawed vis-à-vis Dark. But
like I saying, by the time of their publication and subsequent fame,
gothic prose had largely shaken off its lightweight and déclassé
image. Class and taste were no longer the problem, rather, expression
and depiction. But as I insist, prose attempting Dark cannot help but
miss the subtleties and power of poetry.<label id='fnr.94' for='fnr-in.94.4756222' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>94</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.94.4756222' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>94</sup>

As unique and original as I want Novalis&rsquo; <i>Hymns to the Night</i> to
have been, I must present Englishwoman Anna Lætitia Barbauld&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Poems_(Barbauld)/A_Summer_Evening%27s_Meditation">A
Summer Evening&rsquo;s Meditation</a></i> (<i>ASEM</i>) as the same sort of solemn
praising of the Night, but having already appeared in 1773.
</p>

<p>
Without more investigation I have no real idea if Barbauld&rsquo;s <i>ASEM</i>,
weighing in at one hundred and twenty-four lines, started what I&rsquo;m
calling the <i>Night School</i>, but as a working theory, yes, she offered
eighteenth-century Britain a new perspective on Dark with an
accessibility and maturity not really seen in Graveyard and certainly
not gothic novels. She nods to Young&rsquo;s <i>Night-thoughts</i> at the start
with the quote, <i>One sun by day, by night ten thousand shine</i>, then
launches directly into her summer night and its canopy of stars
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Tis past! The sultry tyrant of the south<br>
Has spent his short-liv&rsquo;d rage; more grateful hours<br>
Move silent on; the skies no more repel<br>
The dazzled sight, but with mild maiden beams<br>
Of temper&rsquo;d light, invite the cherish&rsquo;d eye<br>
To wander o&rsquo;er their sphere; where hung aloft<br>
Dian&rsquo;s bright crescent, like a silver bow<br>
New strung in heaven, lifts high its beamy horns<br>
Impatient for the night, and seems to push<br>
Her brother down the sky. Fair Venus shines<br>
E&rsquo;en in the eye of day; with sweetest beam<br>
Propitious shines, and shakes a trembling flood<br>
Of soften&rsquo;d radiance from her dewy locks.<br>
The shadows spread apace; while meeken&rsquo;d Eve<br>
Her cheek yet warm with blushes, slow retires<br>
Thro&rsquo; the Hesperian gardens of the west,<br>
And shuts the gates of day. &rsquo;Tis now the hour<br>
When Contemplation, from her sunless haunts,<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
No woe, no doom-and-gloom; instead, a relentless parade of visceral
and natural Dark hyperconductivity. Barbauld hauls us outdoors to
partake, imbibe, behold the Night like never before. We are not
swimming in doom, rather, we are touched, moved to reflect on darkness
with reverence&#x2026;
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;But are they silent all? or is there not<br>
A tongue in every star that talks with man,<br>
And wooes him to be wife; nor wooes in vain:<br>
This dead of midnight is the noon of thought,<br>
And wisdom mounts her zenith with the stars.<br>
At this still hour the self-collected soul<br>
Turns inward, and beholds a stranger there<br>
Of high descent, and more than mortal rank;<br>
An embryo God; a spark of fire divine,<br>
Which must burn on for ages, when the sun,<br>
(Fair transitory creature of a day!)<br>
Has clos&rsquo;d his golden eye, and wrap&rsquo;d in shades<br>
Forgets his wonted journey thro&rsquo; the east.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Night over day. Night expansive yet serene and passive, a more nuanced
interim inviting deeper, more mature and human introspection. Far
distant, cool, and gentle are the myriad stars of a summer&rsquo;s eve,
unlike our single oversized and often ruinous local star of day. And
here is some of my own doggerel called <i>From a Grandniece To Her
Great-aunt At Her Great-uncle’s Funeral</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
You see, dear Auntie,<br>
Day is all supposes,<br>
Night but only a few.<br>
Night quietly closes<br>
Day’s great to-do.<br>
Lost on the Day,<br>
I wait for deepest Night,<br>
for Darkness and I must<br>
Decline clamant Light.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This is my kind of Dark, i.e., free of any campy scare tactics&#x2014;fun
as they may be. Most assuredly every protégé of the Dark Muse, all
darkly inspired must read Barbauld&rsquo;s masterpiece. Hers is an
exposition of natural darkness, placing it far above the reproach of
gothic horror detractors. Though <i>ASEM</i> was as far as I can tell a
singleton, a unicorn whose influence seemed to lay dormant for
decades.<label id='fnr.95' for='fnr-in.95.4856520' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>95</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.95.4856520' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>95</sup>
&#x2026;although Wordsworth would later mention Barbauld and
<i>ASEM</i> as inspirational.
</span> One Barbauld biographer mentioned a trend of that time
of ladies studying astronomy. But obviously Barbauld is waxing Dark,
not just dabbling with celestial bodies. Perusing her other poems,
yes, she often dwells on nature, sometimes in a dusky way, but
addressing Dark as she did with <i>ASEM</i> doesn&rsquo;t appear again, nor from
others during her pre-Romanticism times. Today she is known as an
influential social commentator, moralist, and educator, but not as
proto-Romanticism. And so I must jump ahead some <i>fifty</i> years and
bring in Brontëan poetry as a direct continuation of this Night School
thread. Haworth Emily&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Complete_Poems_of_Emily_Bront%C3%AB/Stars">Stars</a></i> is just one her many examples of Night
School from someone who probably had never read nor heard of
Barbauld&rsquo;s <i>ASEM</i>. Exactly like Barbauld, in <i>Stars</i> Haworth Emily
lauds the night and its starry sky
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Thought followed thought, star followed star<br>
Through boundless regions, on;<br>
While one sweet influence, near and far,<br>
Thrilled through, and proved us one!<br>
<br>
Why did the morning dawn to break<br>
So great, so pure, a spell;<br>
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek,<br>
Where your cool radiance fell?<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
The untrammelled night sky&rsquo;s depth and expanse over the harsh blaring,
the tedium of daylight life, indeed. And so the last two stanzas
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Oh, stars, and dreams, and gentle night;<br>
Oh, night and stars, return!<br>
And hide me from the hostile light<br>
That does not warm, but burn;<br>
<br>
That drains the blood of suffering men;<br>
Drinks tears, instead of dew;<br>
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,<br>
And only wake with you!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Night School redeems Dark by pulling it out of the ostentatiousness,
the gimmickry of Graveyard and gothic. Probably started by Barbauld
(until I may find evidence to the contrary), it was independently
embraced by others. Let&rsquo;s look at sister Anne Brontë&rsquo;s <i>Night</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I love the silent hour of night,<br>
For blissful dreams may then arise,<br>
Revealing to my charmed sight<br>
What may not bless my waking eyes.<br>
<br>
And then a voice may meet my ear,<br>
That death has silenced long ago;<br>
And hope and rapture may appear<br>
Instead of solitude and woe.<br>
<br>
Cold in the grave for years has lain<br>
The form it was my bliss to see;<br>
And only dreams can bring again,<br>
The darling of my heart to me.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Simpler, more measured was Anne&rsquo;s poetry than her sister&rsquo;s. And she
includes the grave by eulogising either of her older sisters Maria or
Elizabeth, or her mother, but again, sans drama. And this calmer, more
introspective Dark kept quietly maturing throughout the nineteenth
century.
</p>

<p>
But let us not forget the many poems devoted to the moon. Here is Anne
Brontë&rsquo;s <i>Fluctuations</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
What though the Sun had left my sky;<br>
To save me from despair<br>
The blessed Moon arose on high,<br>
And shone serenely there.<br>
<br>
I watched her, with a tearful gaze,<br>
Rise slowly o&rsquo;er the hill,<br>
While through the dim horizon&rsquo;s haze<br>
Her light gleamed faint and chill.<br>
<br>
I thought such wan and lifeless beams<br>
Could ne&rsquo;er my heart repay<br>
For the bright sun&rsquo;s most transient gleams<br>
That cheered me through the day:<br>
<br>
But, as above that mist&rsquo;s control<br>
She rose, and brighter shone,<br>
I felt her light upon my soul;<br>
But now&#x2014;that light is gone!<br>
<br>
Thick vapours snatched her from my sight,<br>
And I was darkling left,<br>
All in the cold and gloomy night,<br>
Of light and hope bereft:<br>
<br>
Until, methought, a little star<br>
Shone forth with trembling ray,<br>
To cheer me with its light afar&#x2014;<br>
But that, too, passed away.<br>
<br>
Anon, an earthly meteor blazed<br>
The gloomy darkness through;<br>
I smiled, yet trembled while I gazed&#x2014;<br>
But that soon vanished too!<br>
<br>
And darker, drearier fell the night<br>
Upon my spirit then;&#x2014;<br>
But what is that faint struggling light?<br>
Is it the Moon again?<br>
<br>
Kind Heaven! increase that silvery gleam<br>
And bid these clouds depart,<br>
And let her soft celestial beam<br>
Restore my fainting heart!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Here we may imagine the youngest Brontë bowed if not weighed down by
her earthly afflictions, cares, deprivations; but then in this lean,
hungry, susceptible state she is caught in an emotional whirling,
carried, borne up by the natural nighttime procession of sun to moon
and stars. She speaks of her tearful gaze, her fainting heart, her
spirits, her emotional exposure. She is a vulnerable ward of nature,
but all the more tenaciously pursuant of its subtleties. Indeed, back
then it was always subtleties, delicate qualities found in Nature by
the vulnerable if not pathetic human, an exacting counting of
seemingly modest blessings which then gained them a sublime
ascendency. Oh, what we miss today&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
If I weren&rsquo;t pledged to Emily, I might say Anne has an even finer take
on Dark than her older sister. I might dare to say Anne&rsquo;s Christianity
is more conventional, whereas Emily with her obvious
thought-behind-thoughts mental state wound up taking a starker, more
fatalist view of God. Anne humble, Emily defiant perhaps;
nevertheless, the Dark Muse absolutely owned by the B-Sisters!
</p>

<p>
William Wordsworth was nearly always about daylit Nature, as were his
foundational Romanticist ideals. Though in his <i>A Night Thought</i>
(published 1837) he clearly intersects with Night School
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Lo! where the Moon along the sky<br>
Sails with her happy destiny;<br>
Oft is she hid from mortal eye<br>
Or dimly seen,<br>
But when the clouds asunder fly<br>
How bright her mien!<br>
<br>
Far different we&#x2014;a froward race,<br>
Thousands though rich in Fortune&rsquo;s grace<br>
With cherished sullenness of pace<br>
Their way pursue,<br>
Ingrates who wear a smileless face<br>
The whole year through.<br>
<br>
If kindred humours e&rsquo;er would make<br>
My spirit droop for drooping&rsquo;s sake,<br>
From Fancy following in thy wake,<br>
Bright ship of heaven!<br>
A counter impulse let me take<br>
And be forgiven.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Moon and Night would simply be another aspect of didactic Nature,
though he does allude to the more mature subtlety brought by the
darkness. Again, he has wandered into Night School in his <i>To the
Moon</i>, here the second stanza
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
The aspiring Mountains and the winding Streams,<br>
Empress of Night! are gladdened by thy beams;<br>
A look of thine the wilderness pervades,<br>
And penetrates the forest&rsquo;s inmost shades;<br>
Thou, chequering peaceably the minster&rsquo;s gloom,<br>
Guid&rsquo;st the pale Mourner to the lost one&rsquo;s tomb;<br>
Canst reach the Prisoner&#x2014;to his grated cell<br>
Welcome, though silent and intangible!&#x2014;<br>
And lives there one, of all that come and go<br>
On the great waters toiling to and fro,<br>
One, who has watched thee at some quiet hour<br>
Enthroned aloft in undisputed power,<br>
Or crossed by vapoury streaks and clouds that move<br>
Catching the lustre they in part reprove&#x2014;<br>
Nor sometimes felt a fitness in thy sway<br>
To call up thoughts that shun the glare of day,<br>
And make the serious happier than the gay?<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
If I previously alluded Wordsworth concentrated on Nature over Dark,
with these choice few lines he does Dark Muse very well, indeed. Sad
then that he didn&rsquo;t have more to say about Dark.
</p>

<p>
Allow me to mention another Night Schooler, namely, the Swiss poet
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Keller">Gottfried Keller</a>. Again, he is even later by some three or four
decades than the Brontës or Wordsworth. Here is his <i>Winternacht</i> or
<i>Winter Night</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Not a wingbeat went through the world;<br>
silent and brilliant lay the white snow.<br>
Not a puff of cloud hung in the starry canopy,<br>
no wave surged in the torpid lake.<br>
<br>
From the depths climbed a lake-tree,<br>
to its crown encased in ice;<br>
and upon its branches climbed the water nymph,<br>
gazing up through the green ice.<br>
<br>
There I stood upon the thin glass<br>
that separated me from the black depths;<br>
Close beneath my feet I saw<br>
her white beauty, limb for limb.<br>
<br>
With smothered sorrow she groped<br>
here and there on the hard barrier.<br>
Never will I will forget her dark expression;<br>
always, always, shall it remain in my mind!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
One of my favourites, I have always wondered what the protagonist did
with the rest of his life. Did he return to the lake to try and find
his water nymph; or did he resign himself to his mortal and mundane
life? Indeed, the human divorced from Nature, though having a reunion
of sorts one night. In any event, the mystery and allure, the
aesthetic of a forest in deep winter night is undeniable.<label id='fnr.96' for='fnr-in.96.8476467' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>96</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.96.8476467' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>96</sup>
We&rsquo;ll talk about <i>liminality</i> soon&#x2026;
</span> Such
magic and mystery obviously could not have occurred in daylight. Like
Edgar Allan Poe&rsquo;s <i>The Raven</i>, which we will discuss below, there is a
melancholy over a loss that deepens and ultimately enriches.
</p>

<p>
And so with Night School first there is Nature dark, then human
reflection upon that natural Dark. To be sure, recitations of the
world in darkness give subtle rise to the finest, keenest insights and
feelings. <i>&#x2026;to call up thoughts that shun the glare of day</i>, indeed.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb4feeb7">
<p>
If a group of people enter a restaurant together, the maître d&rsquo; will
probably assume they are a party and require a single table. This is a
good analogy to what has happened to my Dark principals over the
years. I certainly have a lot to say about what has come to be known
as <i>Romanticism</i>,<label id='fnr.97' for='fnr-in.97.2332334' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>97</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.97.2332334' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>97</sup>
The Jena Set&rsquo;s Friedrich Schlegel first used <i>romantic</i> in
contrast to <i>classic</i> to describe what they in Jena were supposedly
starting. But it wasn&rsquo;t until the 1820s when the term Romanticism
became widely known and used&#x2014;evermore randomly&#x2026;
</span> as it is the catch-all term meant to make my
principals sit at the same table and seem good company.
</p>

<p>
By now the reader knows I want my principals to have come by their
sublime poetry &ldquo;as naturally as leaves come to a tree,&rdquo; as the film
<i>Bright Star</i>&rsquo;s Keats said. I insist my visionaries were just that,
timeless and visionary. Yes, they might have had much in common,
obviously a time line, but I cannot abide reducing them to puppets
dangling on strings connected, owing to proto-this or precursor-that
on some academe&rsquo;s assembly line.<label id='fnr.98' for='fnr-in.98.5732047' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>98</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.98.5732047' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>98</sup>
A quote from M.H. Abrams&rsquo; laborious <i>The Mirror and the Lamp</i>
would insist &#x2026; <i>even an aesthetic philosophy so abstract and
seemingly academic as that of Kant can be shown to have modified the
work of poets.</i> Really? I doubt the Brontë sisters read much Kant. But
then Abrams never even mentions the Brontës&#x2026;
</span> Of course my principals were
of their times, and yet outliers, outsiders, unicorns, not for lumping
together or lining up on a labelled shelf. Worse, I also insist their
actual lives give little solid insight into their gifts. And yet we
have this most <i>unnatural</i> box, this clammy container created by both
contemporaries of the day, then subsequent generations of experts to
hold, control, own, to <i>jail</i> my greats, this cage they call
<i>Romanticism</i>. And so I say again, gripping butterflies squashes them.

tangles cords and wires, connecting up Descartes, Rousseau, the
American and French Revolutions, Defoe, Spinoza, Bacon, Hobbs,

From the outset, the Schlegels in Jena made Shakespeare a
principal proto-Romanticist, Ludwig Tieck and others of the Jena Set
feverishly translating his plays into German. For me this was a clear
sign they were on the wrong road. I will at some future date have my
fictional character from my novel <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i> tell you why.
</span> &#x2026; Buddha, Jesus, Merlin, the Pope, etc., to form
massive graphs of vertices and edges spanning the near and distant
past&#x2014;the denser, the more far-fetched the better. And yet this
microscopic literary DNA matching is mostly happening long after the
fact in a modern setting, separate, aloof, and ultimately terminally
clueless. So often my beloved visionary principals are
anachronistically tagged proto-Beat, archetypal-hippie,
back-to-nature, right-brain contrarian iconoclasts just doing their
anti-Establishment thing.<label id='fnr.102' for='fnr-in.102.4627558' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>102</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.102.4627558' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>102</sup>
So convenient for modern experts that Jena Romanticism came
about in a for its time free-wheeling university town, many of the
Jena Set also lecturers and professors at the University of
Jena. Perhaps a modern version would have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mountain_College">Black Mountain College</a>.

<p>
There is the famous Oxford professor Isaiah Berlin<label id='fnr.103' for='fnr-in.103.6177271' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>103</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.103.6177271' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>103</sup>

published later in book form as <i>The Roots of Romanticism</i>.
</span> who
described Romanticism in an oft-sited set of lectures as
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a new and restless spirit, seeking <i>violently</i> to burst through old
and cramping forms,<label id='fnr.104' for='fnr-in.104.3653647' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>104</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.104.3653647' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>104</sup>

<li>a <i>nervous</i> preoccupation with perpetually changing inner states of
consciousness,</li>
<li>a longing for the unbounded and the indefinable, for perpetual
movement and change,</li>
<li>an effort to return to the forgotten sources of life,</li>
<li>a <i>passionate</i> effort at self-assertion both individual and
collective,</li>
<li>a search after means of expressing an <i>unappeasable yearning for
unattainable goals</i>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Especially the last point makes my principals seem like children who
want everything in life&rsquo;s candy shop. Again, an intentionality is
implied that my principals most certainly did not bring&#x2014;leading us
once more to the disjunction between latter-day &ldquo;expert&rdquo; analysts and
the original, now grave-mute creators. But then the question Berlin
raised at the beginning of his first lecture, namely, whether this was
really a movement at all&#x2014;or just a state of mind always &ldquo;in the
air,&rdquo; emerging but then fading, as I might add, like virtual quantum
particles blinking in and out of existence&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Similarly, Berlin cannot nail down what supposed adherents to
Romanticism really wanted or were about. He imagines interviewing
Romanticism proponents of the times
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Suppose you had spoken to these persons. You would have found that
their ideal of life was approximately of the following kind
&#x2026; integrity, sincerity, readiness to sacrifice one&rsquo;s life to some
inner light, dedication to some ideal for which it is worth
sacrificing all that one is, for which it is worth both living and
dying. You would have found that they were not primarily interested in
knowledge, or in the advance of science, not interested in political
power, not interested in happiness, not interested, above all, in
adjustment to life, in finding your place in society, in living at
peace with your government, even in loyalty to your king or to your
republic. You would have found that common sense, moderation, was very
far from their thoughts.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In my humble opinion, this describes nothing. Granted, Berlin seems to
cotton on to how very cryptic and fluid it all was back then. But
again, he is describing just a proponent, a person in the stands with
his &ldquo;these persons&rdquo;&#x2014;and missing what really made my principals so
great. He just doesn&rsquo;t get it. He mistakes the chance geometry on the
forest floor for a path that really was never there.
</p>

<p>
As a writer myself I can say writing is difficult. I once sat down and
tried to write something prose without any prior ideas, themes, or
prompts. I simply asked myself over and over &ldquo;What are you trying to
say?&rdquo; And out came a wild story of a Byronic hero, probably a ghost,
pacing up and down a past-century street in eternal twilight being
reclaimed by encroaching Nature. Right. I can say yes to Berlin&rsquo;s
not-interesteds above, but then I stand as he does before the question
of <i>What are we trying to do?</i> In my case a dark, gothic novella
popped out of all the confusion and blockage&#x2014;and this long before I
had turned my attention to Dark. Such a lack of definite is quite
obvious in my principals as well.
</p>

<p>
For example, much is made by latter-day experts of the &ldquo;writing
contest&rdquo; held by Byron, the Shelleys, Mary and Percy, and John
Polidori in the summer of 1816. Indeed, there could be nothing more
Dark than an unnaturally (volcanic eruption-induced) cold, wet, and
dark summer in a villa on Lake Geneva. If you have ever been around
intelligent, creative people who are throwing around ideas, you&rsquo;ll
know how wild and unpredictable it can be. Out of that summer&rsquo;s
endeavour came <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein">Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus</a></i> written by
Mary Shelley,<label id='fnr.105' for='fnr-in.105.6775791' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>105</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.105.6775791' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>105</sup>
Contrast with E.T.A. Hoffmann&rsquo;s very gothic and sinister <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman_(short_story)">The
Sandman</a></i> appeared in 1817 dealing with an all-too-human mechanical
automaton.
</span> <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vampyre">The Vampyre; A Tale</a></i> written by John Polidori,
and Byron&rsquo;s <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness_(poem)">Darkness</a></i>. But again, this is the literary version of
quantum virtual particles coming into existence out of nowhere, with
no real rhyme or reason to rearrange some two centuries later into
dissertations. And though Dark was the centreing concept, all three
works are really just throwbacks to gothic horror. In my estimation,
they did not move the Dark needle into the red zone.
</p>

<p>
Again, the question: Where is Dark in any of academe&rsquo;s Romanticism?
And no, I don&rsquo;t mean campy pop gothic. The feelings, the emotions, and
above all, the vision Haworth Emily describes in <i>Fall leaves fall</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;I shall smile when wreaths of snow<br>
Blossom where the rose should grow;<br>
I shall sing when night’s decay<br>
Ushers in a drearier day.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
simply do not appear in any academic treatment of Romanticism, forcing
me through this manifesto to start over from scratch. Again, <i>Emily is
not just Novalis&rsquo; poetising.</i> When I read her <i>Fall leaves fall</i>, yes,
they are words to be processed by my brain&rsquo;s logical language model,
but then they land on the emotional limbic part of my mind. This is a
quasi-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron">mirror neuron</a> &ldquo;yes, I feel this way too&rdquo; moment giving me pause
and transporting me once again to the gates of the Dark Muse. <i>Fall
leaves fall</i> is its own alpha and omega, i.e., I imbibe, feel, and go
forth. I <i>behold</i> all this sublime ideation of darkness and allow it
to move me. And it surely does. But then that is all. <i>There is no
further work for the logical frontal cortex, let alone scholarship.</i>
Haworth Emily infects me with contagion, and I too smile and sing
along with her for the Dark Muse.
</p>

<p>
Surely we all try to follow logically-set plans, rules in our lives,
logically-derived &ldquo;goals.&rdquo; But we are simultaneously emotional beings,
constantly assessing how we <i>feel</i> about this or that, how we <i>feel</i>
overall. This is what I call the <i>logic train</i> and the <i>emotion
braid</i>. And so when I read <i>Fall leaves fall</i> my braid of emotions
stretching back to my birth (or even further) swells and lifts me
beyond my mundane, deterministic logic train. <i>And it is exactly this
mirroring and swelling that scholars don&rsquo;t get, never catch on to.</i>
Visions of snowy wreathes and night&rsquo;s decay have me pause on my clear,
well-lit logic track.
</p>

<p>
How do we maintain emotional health? By minding our feelings. And so I
will share a bit of my folk psychology: We cannot allow the logical to
always dominate and control the emotional. There can be no stripping out
of some strand of our emotion braiding. And so when dealing with
academe&rsquo;s cutting around on Romanticism I must, as Amherst Emily said,
<i>Beware of the surgeon with his knife, lest he find the culprit life</i>.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5572505">
<p>
The indoorsmen of academe never fail to raise <i>nature</i> up as a
hallmark of Romanticism. It&rsquo;s nature, nature, nature&#x2014;but with only
the most patronising view of what it meant to my principals. Nature
what? Nature awareness, appreciation, adulation, respect,
idealisation, idolisation, rapture, fervour, worship. And so Nature
becomes just a metaphor supply closet,<label id='fnr.106' for='fnr-in.106.1065177' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>106</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.106.1065177' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>106</sup>
More about <i>pathetic fallacy</i> soon.
</span> a source of inspiration,
a cruel mistress, a loving mother&#x2014;an hallucinogenic drug&#x2026; So
separated from Nature as academe is, Nature gets batted around
endlessly, again, making my principals seem soppy, dreamy,
sentimental, their lines see-through by us greater, wiser modernist
grownups. Again, academe does not, cannot understand Nature as I&rsquo;ve
described it above, i.e., a non-place; instead, the constant
everything everywhere cycles of birth, growth, deterioration, and
Death.
</p>

<p>
Academe&rsquo;s favourite Romanticism nature boy is of course William
Wordsworth, whom so many call Romanticism&rsquo;s godfather<label id='fnr.107' for='fnr-in.107.4693705' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>107</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.107.4693705' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>107</sup>
&#x2026;due to ignorance of Novalis? Alas&#x2026;
</span>&#x2014;but
then routinely pan as a sappy sentimentalist. Scholars are creatures
of their times too, beholden unto the modern age and its shallow
urban-bound nihilist-tainted public. Thus, they cannot help but use as
touchstones modern realism and our supposedly more objective and
unvarnished realist understanding of nature. Whatever Wordsworth said
about wandering like a cloud and going nuts over daffodils is
presented to classrooms as affected, mushy, maudlin
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I wandered lonely as a cloud<br>
That floats on high o&rsquo;er vales and hills,<br>
When all at once I saw a crowd,<br>
A host, of golden daffodils;<br>
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,<br>
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.<br>
<br>
Continuous as the stars that shine<br>
And twinkle on the milky way,<br>
They stretched in never-ending line<br>
Along the margin of a bay:<br>
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,<br>
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.<br>
<br>
The waves beside them danced; but they<br>
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:<br>
A poet could not but be gay,<br>
In such a jocund company:<br>
I gazed—and gazed&#x2014;but little thought<br>
What wealth the show to me had brought:<br>
<br>
For oft, when on my couch I lie<br>
In vacant or in pensive mood,<br>
They flash upon that inward eye<br>
Which is the bliss of solitude;<br>
And then my heart with pleasure fills,<br>
And dances with the daffodils.<br>

Eye rolls, smirks, and tsk-tsking in today&rsquo;s English department
classrooms. The fonder Wordsworth&rsquo;s waxing, the more he is the target of
our patronisation and condemnation. Missed entirely is his subtle and
sublime. Here from <i>Lines Written a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,<br>
In which the burthen of the mystery,<br>
In which the heavy and the weary weight<br>
Of all this unintelligible world,<br>
Is lightened:&#x2014;that serene and blessed mood,<br>
In which the affections gently lead us on,&#x2014;<br>
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame<br>
And even the motion of our human blood<br>
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep<br>
In body, and become a living soul:<br>
While with an eye made quiet by the power<br>
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,<br>
We see into the life of things.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Modernism has no concept of, no use for affections, for serene and
blessed moods, of seeing into the true life of things. Of course
Wordsworth is genial here. He goes to the heart and soul of what I
want to bring forth with WutheringUK, even though he hasn&rsquo;t included
Dark. With words he causes great vibrations to my emotion braid by
<i>yearning for true membership to the greater realm of Nature</i>&#x2014;as I
would. He&rsquo;s a thankful man, which is so foreign to the ego-,
anthropocentric modernist triumphalist today. We, however, supposedly
better informed by modern science, distance ourselves from any sort
environmental equality. And so a false pseudo-objectivity comes home
to roost. A scholar in the Wikipedia article on <i>Tintern Abbey</i>
complains of Wordsworth ignoring the reality of the times
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
[Wordsworth manages] to see into the life of things only by narrowing
and skewing his field of vision and by excluding certain conflictual
sights and meanings.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Obviously, Wordsworth was a toxic male apologist for the
hetero-patriarchal capitalist industrialist imperialist system,
conveniently ignoring how so very many women and minorities were being
oppressed exactly as he, so privileged, gazed so narrowly upon those
sights and penned those lines&#x2026; And so Wordsworth winds up just a
dusty old statue glimpsed during a quick run-through the classic wing
of the museum, much more interesting, much better things in the modern
wing for sure. Alas&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Most condemned, Wordsworth tried to make nature the main house for
human purity and innocence. In <i>To a Highland Girl</i> he transforms a
peasant shepherdess he encountered on a trip to Scotland into a
demi-angel
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;With earnest feeling I shall pray<br>
For thee when I am far away:<br>
For never saw I mien, or face,<br>
In which more plainly I could trace<br>
Benignity and home-bred sense<br>
Ripening in perfect innocence.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I guess you had to have been there&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
And so nature for modern academe is never more than a <i>theme</i>, a
<i>leitmotif</i>, thus, a piece of the very oxymoron-ish &ldquo;creative
machinery&rdquo;&#x2014;bereft of any clue as to what Nature as I capitalise it
means.<label id='fnr.108' for='fnr-in.108.7406641' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>108</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.108.7406641' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>108</sup>
&#x2026;and again there is certainly no inkling of what I spoke of
above about the modern indoor-outdoor dichotomy.
</span> Indeed, Nature conducive to feelings and innocence,
inviting re-sensitisation &#x2026; Romanticism poetry so often nothing more
than someone describing what they <i>see</i> and how it makes them <i>feel</i>
and <i>yearn</i> &#x2026; but then modern realism, now mired in nihilism and
outright absurdism, not able to abide any of this and actively trying
to denigrate it. The modernist harps on <i>reality</i> as if only we today
know it, certainly not the creative souls of over two centuries
past. How dare anyone raise up sentimentality let alone sublimity in
the midsts of hardships only we moderns have properly addressed, e.g.,
a sexually-oppressed working-class shepherdess who undoubtedly had to
wash her homespun clothing by hand with lye soap. The modernist&rsquo;s
favourite word is &ldquo;conditions,&rdquo; as in &ldquo;conditions were deplorable&rdquo;
meant to cancel any nature gushing by privileged elitist poets. And so
the ghosts of an &ldquo;oppressive system&rdquo; are always trotted out to cast
shade on my principals&#x2014;despite how vulnerable everyone of that age
was. I hope with WutheringUK to give you a better understanding of who
and what my principals were.
</p>

<p>
As I just said, so often my principals simply listed out with reverent
poetising their observations of nature, as does Anne Brontë in her
<i>Lines Composed in a Wood on a Windy Day</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
My soul is awakened, my spirit is soaring<br>
And carried aloft on the wings of the breeze;<br>
For above and around me the wild wind is roaring,<br>
Arousing to rapture the earth and the seas.<br>
<br>
The long withered grass in the sunshine is glancing,<br>
The bare trees are tossing their branches on high;<br>
The dead leaves beneath them are merrily dancing,<br>
The white clouds are scudding across the blue sky<br>
<br>
I wish I could see how the ocean is lashing<br>
The foam of its billows to whirlwinds of spray;<br>
I wish I could see how its proud waves are dashing,<br>
And hear the wild roar of their thunder to-day!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I see my principals instinctively, unintentionally, belatedly stamping
a new European nature worship out of their nearby moors and
forests&#x2014;necessarily independent of whatever had been the vernacular
paganisms before Roman occupation &#x2026; orthogonal as well to
Elizabethan pastoral lyric, German <i>Shepherd Poetry</i> of the
post-Thirty Years War seventeenth century, or even the Greek Arcadian
<i>Bucolic</i> traditions, and, of course fully unaware of any of our New
Age Eastern-slash-shamanism mashups.<label id='fnr.109' for='fnr-in.109.6066961' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>109</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.109.6066961' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>109</sup>
One observer called this modern tendency to appropriate
Eastern religion along with animist aboriginal shamanism &ldquo;spiritual
grandiosity.&rdquo;
</span> They found something
entirely new and, dare I say, as authentic as possible. Again, Nature
capitalised. Then the urge to explore how nuanced Nature was. Here is
a more sober quote from Haworth Emily
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
All creation is equally mad. Nature is an inexplicable problem; it
exists on a principle of destruction. Every being must be the tireless
instrument of death to others, or itself must cease to live. Yet
nonetheless we celebrate the day of our birth, and we praise God for
having entered such a world.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In my opinion, this says it all&#x2014;and in such simple terms. Later I
will dive into the three poems which I believe describe this seemingly
simple but portentously paradoxical observation best. But I must
emphasise, <i>her Nature is completely different from our modern
scientific and locational ideas thereof</i>.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb8357f7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb8357f7">Sensitivity</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb8357f7">
<p>
Besides Nature, the modern ivory tower wants my principals, as for
example Berlin argues, to have been more in tune with their senses,
more impulsive, less emotionally suppressed&#x2014;out to downright
sensual.<label id='fnr.110' for='fnr-in.110.95192' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>110</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.110.95192' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>110</sup>
&#x2026;they always trot out Byron for <b>Romanticism = sensual</b>.
</span> And so when not signalling political correctness,
modern scholars simply patronise, like developmental psychologists
describing children. I am constantly confronted with how modernists so
widely miss what being instinctual and creative was back in the
so-called Romantic Era. Regrettable this, how one sort of gifted&#x2014;the
analytical intellectual scholar&#x2014;is unable to fathom another sort of
gifted&#x2014;the artistic lyrical.
</p>

<p>
And yet from an historical, socio-psychological standpoint we today
may only guess (badly?) at what creative, sensitive people in those
times saw, thought, felt. Insensitive to the suffering of the
oppressed classes? What did the escalating Industrial Revolution, as
well as British imperialism mean to people at the dawn of the
nineteenth century? I posit these external forces were the source of
dehumanising and ultimately <i>desensitising</i> reverberations throughout
society, felt keenest by my brightest, most sensitive
people. Politically correct as we might be, we today are at quite
different levels of accommodating the awful, at normalising,
relativising, turning on numbness to the consequences of modern
industrial life. But as the eighteenth century was ending, moral and
emotional disassociation was not so advanced, reactions more
spontaneous and honest. And to be sure, my principals were affronted
by what humanity was doing, troubled especially over where it was all
heading.
</p>

<p>
No, my principals did not personally experience human exploitation,
colonialism, capitalist industrialism, and yet they either knew of it
or sensed its impact. And in their own fashion they became
crypto-reactionary against it. What was conscious versus what
subconscious in Wordsworth&rsquo;s mind as he sat above the Tintern Abbey
ruins? Indeed, all of the negativity supposedly swirling around&#x2014;the
burgeoning British Empire, the immediate proto-indstrialism havoc all
around the River Wye and environs. And yet his response was limbic
pondering. Of course modern academe will churn out filler&#x2014;the
historicity, the paradigms, and socio-political winds. They make the
backdrop of Enlightenment&rsquo;s cold, relentless dynamism and reductionist
determinism visible in contrast. But this all misses the visceral, the
emotional aspect. And so I say, <i>It takes a poet to know a poet, and
it takes a special, time-travelling poet to know these special
Romantic Era poets.</i>
</p>

<p>
But then dare I, your guide, claiming poetic skill, be so critical of
all these well-established Romantic Era professors? Following is
something I wrote in the spirit
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
And from bygone generations I have surely more than blood.<br>
The loom, the wrapped bolt a shared past, holds me taunt.<br>
And try though I may, little hope there is finding out,<br>

For no sooner is some design of<br>
Art, music, words offered than opens<br>
A far greater twilit space echoing the past.<br>
Alas, that these modern conceits must us all fail;<br>
For the Muses range far above, behind, and beyond&#x2014;<br>
From the heart out to the eternal sea, sky, land,<br>
And everywhere and forever between,<br>

<br>
Woe, the tarried songbird whose weakening wings<br>
In late November portend death’s evening hour,<br>
Life’s requisite warmth finally dissipated,<br>
Her once vast blue space closing dark,<br>
The mysterious frontiers setting up,<br>
The shadowy boundary closing&#x2026;<br>
<br>
That we humans may touch,<br>
Stroke the dark velvet curtains<br>
Long before we slip the concealed gaps.<br>
Death would have all such anticipation moot&#x2014;<br>
All suppositions. vain assurances flashing then quit,<br>
All expectations rattling, echoing lastly towards stillness<br>
Leaving friends to carry on in dutiful remembrance,<br>
That those, at graveside, must as best they can<br>
Face the darkness and resolutely reach out<br>
Beyond the day’s anguish and sadness<br>
(Vainly?) to some holy everlasting.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
This might have won me an honourable mention back in the day, perhaps
a dinner invite. But I seriously doubt any contemporary Romanticism
experts could have written such lines&#x2014;half because they could not,
half because to such mawkishness they would not deign.
</p>

<p>
Yes, my poets of yore. And as Berlin noted, no political stance was
ever intended; rather, by trying to re-humanise, <i>re-sensitise</i>, à la
Novalis&rsquo; poetising, theirs would be a far more subversive phenomenon
as only some new belief system or &ldquo;underground movement&rdquo; can
be. Socio-political templates of today do not let through my
principals, rather, they cover them up. But if Emily Dickinson, for
example, meant nothing political or even religious, no consciously
declared lifestyle or paradigm, what did she mean, what did any of
them mean or want? To me what they did and said seem in my times
wholly ethereal and extra-human. One historicity modernists cannot
abide is how my principals drafted behind the general severe Calvinist
Christian wake of the time, ultimately deferring to God. Here is Emily
Dickinson poetising belief
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>

the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_District">Lake District</a> becoming the modern world’s first eco-literature

<h4 id="orga15ac7f">East and West: Why my Dark Muse cannot abide the East</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga15ac7f">
<p>
As a teen in the early 1970s, I, like so many around me, fell under
the spell of the strange and mysterious television series <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_(1972_TV_series)">Kung Fu</a></i>,
which premiered in 1972. For a kid growing up in Tennessee, <i>Kung Fu</i>
was a Western pop introduction to Eastern religion and philosophy. The
main character, Kwai Chang Caine, is a Chinese-American orphan raised
in a Chinese Shaolin Buddhist monastery circa mid-1800s. <i>Kung Fu</i>
begins with Caine as a young man revenge killing a nobleman who has
senselessly killed his beloved master. Which of course is the
antithesis of the Buddhist way; hence, Caine must leave the monastery,
and China as well, heading to America. Before this crisis, orphan
Caine was taught the Kung Fu martial arts style alongside the Buddhist
pacifist, non-resistant approach to life. And so episode after episode
Kwai Chang roams across the American Wild West of the mid-nineteenth
century as an aesthete itinerant on the run from the Chinese
government, embodying the peaceful, compassionate way&#x2014;all while
putting bad guys on there butts.
</p>

<p>
Wanting to know more, I found a book on Zen Buddhism where I found the
concept of <i>Unsui</i>, which is Japanese and means <i>cloud, water</i>. The
term also refers to a novice monk
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In Japan, one receives unsui ordination at the beginning of formal
ordained practice, and this is often perceived as &rsquo;novice ordination.&rsquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This dense, written-for-adults book further described unsui
metaphorically, saying water exhibits perfect <i>passive resistance</i>,
e.g., it changes states if challenged: as water it flows around
impediments; as steam it evaporates away from heat; if blocked or
dammed, it simply waits supremely patient; if frozen, likewise,
waits&#x2014;for nothing can stop its eventual movement to the sea. And yet
now I see this as irrelevant to my Dark Muse, a false path, so to
speak. I remember we were all enthralled with Kwai Chang&rsquo;s adventures;
kids and adults alike all looked forward to each new episode. But yes,
looking back I can now say with assurance this extreme Eastern
pacifism is not for me.
</p>

<p>
Buddhism wants enlightenment&#x2014;which supposedly raises us to a higher
trans-human state. For example, once enlightened we no longer can be
dragged down by worldly cares, needs, desires, hassles. But how many
actually reach this state, a place like some quasi-permanent version
of Dostoyevski&rsquo;s presence of eternal harmony? This is why I cannot
take seriously any sort of Eastern religion with the stated goal of
enlightenment, if for no other reason than <i>so very few people ever
arrive at this self-actualization</i>. And where is my Dark in the East?
Say what you will about it, the &ldquo;severist,&rdquo; Calvinist-flavoured
Christianity of the Brontë sisters is probably the &ldquo;house
spirituality&rdquo; of my Dark Muse.
</p>

<p>
But can there be a Western Zen? To be sure, Emily Brontë&rsquo;s <i>All
creation is equally mad&#x2026;</i> presents a deep koan-like paradox. Which
would seem to fall into fatalism or perhaps stoicism rather than
offering any guarantees to higher consciousness. <i>Buddhism promises
relief from suffering. My Dark, however, &ldquo;works with suffering.&rdquo;</i>
</p>

<p>
My principals never sought to offer anything as spiritually
comprehensive as Buddhism, no sort of spiritual path to higher
anything. They held seeds, not finished canned goods. They expanded on
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturm_und_Drang">Sturm und Drang</a></i>, but did not draw out any sort of architectural
plans. Yes, interaction with, movement in Nature; but no political or
spiritual paradigms towards specified goals for the mundane
world. They lived haphazardly, spoke in fragments, and the results
were anti-comprehensive. One final observation of Goethe was similar:
He was central to this time, but centralised nothing. He too saw
Nature as everything, if for nothing more than endless empirical study
as did his dear friend Alexander von Humboldt. As Goethe notes, Nature
has endless facets impossible to comprehend as a whole&#x2026;
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Nature has no system, she has, she is life and consequence from an
unknown centre out to an unrecognisable perimeter.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
And how could just poetised feelings&#x2014;Longfellow&rsquo;s piteous ruing of
snowflakes, Novalis&rsquo; swooning over the night&#x2014;counter all the violent
dog-eat-dog of mad creation, all the smashing, banging, clanging, all
the shouting, wailing, arguing of real world Britain going on over the
moorland horizon? While Goethe assuredly did, my principals never
attempted to own or direct the aesthetics of their times. After all,
what could have been the artistic, aesthetic compliment to
colonialism, Newtonian science, capitalist industrialism, and the
subsequent Marxist surge?
</p>

<p>
And therein lies so much of the irony and paradox of what my
principals stirred up. What sense did naming William &ldquo;Dances With
Daffodils&rdquo; Wordsworth poet laureate of the British Empire
make?<label id='fnr.113' for='fnr-in.113.6552547' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>113</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.113.6552547' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>113</sup>
&#x2026;named in 1843.
</span> No, indeed, what the Romantic Era poets and artists
created was, as we might categorise (sic) it, a very <i>underground</i>
aesthetic, an anti-movement that blanched and faded in the presence of
political debate, that called no seekers, no bhikkhus, no one
torturing themselves into the lotus position to seek higher spiritual
planes. Grim was the new industrial urban world where the once
blithely subsistence peasants was compelled to migrate into hellscape
cities to become wage slaves, living in squalor, hunger, and
exploitation. <i>Homo homini lupus</i> <label id='fnr.114' for='fnr-in.114.9962660' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>114</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.114.9962660' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>114</sup>
<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_homini_lupus">Man is a wolf to man</a></i>.
</span> had raised its terrible
head in a new and awful way. The <i>radical philosophers</i>, as the
proto-Marxist activists were called by some, attacked seeking to
violently wrest power from the wealthy, i.e., the modern haves versus
the have-nots. Marxist dialectics insisted that when the gradient
became too great necessarily the revolution will begin.<label id='fnr.115' for='fnr-in.115.989847' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>115</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.115.989847' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>115</sup>
Some might call Marx&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Condition_of_the_Working_Class_in_England">The Condition of the Working Class in
England</a> published in 1845 the beginning of Marxism.
</span> But my
principals seemed mute. Or were they?
</p>

<p>
From the start many opposed what Romanticism seemed to be doing and
saying. Goethe and Schiller promoted as an alternative their <i>Weimar
Classicism</i>. To their thinking, some neo-classicism was the best
compliment to modern man. But then what aesthetic could compliment
real-world imperialism? Obviously an art touting glory, majesty,
splendor, regality, grandeur to justify, substantiate whatever
terrible things were going out on the imperial frontiers. Even more
poignant was the classicist envelope around religion, elevating the
huge paradox of pious, compassionate Christianity as a seemingly
stop-at-nothing empire&rsquo;s real underlying humanistic intentions. All in
all, Romanticism could not be applied anywhere except perhaps on a
walk in Wordworth&rsquo;s Lake District, or from the Brontë&rsquo;s Haworth, out
over the moors to the Top Withens ruins. Indeed, the Wordsworths
offered a new sort of membership to Nature strange and mysterious with
no rationalisations or justifications of industrialism or
imperialism. So very ironic, but yes, Britain seemed to be saying
&ldquo;Wordsworth is who we truly are&rdquo; when he was named poet laureate,
ruing silently perhaps absentee capitalism for its environmental
destruction and imperialism for its lack of humble Wordsworthian
nativism. A Britain dominant and ascending seemingly knew it was going
against its true self, violating its collective soul&rsquo;s warranty.
</p>

<p>
Germany likewise was in political as well as aesthetic uncertainty and
turmoil.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
In 1806, Napoleon conquered Prussia. French troops occupied and sacked
Weimar, where Goethe had lived since 1775. They broke into Goethe’s
house; many of his friends lost everything. Still, Goethe reconciled
himself to Napoleon’s empire, which he regarded as a <b>legitimate
successor to the Holy Roman Empire</b>. <br>

</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This acceptance of Napoleon&rsquo;s vaguely hinted at republicanism and
supposed modernisations led many German intellectuals to forgive
whatever destruction the French invasion caused, for in the end the
crazy quilt of backwards German postage-stamp-sized principalities
would finally be forced into the &ldquo;modern era.&rdquo;<label id='fnr.116' for='fnr-in.116.8120392' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>116</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.116.8120392' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>116</sup>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_mediatisation">German mediatisation</a> brought on by Napoleonic conquest of the
so-called Germanic <i>Holy Roman Empire</i> reduced, secularlised, and
consolidated the German states from 300 down to 39.
</span> Or so the
thinking went. But not all were on board. For example, leading
Romanticist painter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspar_David_Friedrich">Caspar David Friedrich</a> with his <i>Der Chasseur im
Walde</i><label id='fnr.117' for='fnr-in.117.9577920' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>117</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.117.9577920' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>117</sup>
Friedrich&rsquo;s enigmatic <i>Der Chasseur im Walde</i>, 1814 <br>
<img src="images/FriedrichLostFrenchSoldier.png" alt="FriedrichLostFrenchSoldier.png"> <br>
<br>
</span> (<i>The Chasseur [soldier] in the Forest</i>) from 1814
depicts a sort of comeuppance for arrogant French modernisation
against timeless, indomitable German Nature. His visual metaphor has a
single French soldier apparently under a spell, obviously lost and
separated from the French retreat from Russia, while the symbol of
doom, the raven, waits. If any painter understood Dark, it was Caspar
David Friedrich. Perusing his works, we see he <i>never</i> stoops to
fright memes, but delivers an exquisitely liminal darkness.

<p>
Novalis promoted a nostalgia for the Medieval Era&#x2014;which only
confused his contemporaries. Likewise, Walpole was all in for medieval
in his more melodramatic way. Later, critiques of <i>Jane Eyre</i> chided
its nostalgic, rustic appeal for English moorlands. All Brontëan
writing has the thread of rootedness to the land, which should be
timeless, but then was often seen as all too twee nostalgic. What then
is going on with nostalgia? What are we doing when we are nostalgic?
</p>

<p>
The Brontë sisters languished in obscurity most of their
lives,<label id='fnr.118' for='fnr-in.118.4050638' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>118</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.118.4050638' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>118</sup>
Oddly enough, the Brontës are completely left out of many key
academic analyses of Romanticism. For example, Abrams&rsquo; <i>The Mirror and
the Lamp</i>, Beach&rsquo;s <i>The Concept of Nature in Nineteenth-Century
English Poetry</i>, and Berlin&rsquo;s <i>The Roots of Romanticism</i> make no
mention of them! Maybe they had read <a href="https://classicalu.com/wp-content/uploads/Bronte-upload-4.pdf">Virginia Woolf&rsquo;s comments on
<i>Jane Eyre</i></a> and had given up the B-Sisters for a bad job. See <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/19/virginia-woolf-in-bronte-country-jane-eyre">this
analysis</a> as well. Big cringe. More soon&#x2026;
</span> but as they gradually gained popular recognition in the
latter half of the eighteenth century, Victorian Neo-Romantics kept up
with portraying a softer, kinder Britain separate from the capitalist
industrialist, imperialist militarist reality. Miss Jane Eyre,
suspected of fairy ancestry, incessantly asked, Who and what am I?
Which was answered, &ldquo;You are a charge of the land and your people.&rdquo;
Thus was a delicate bundle of Dark, Nature, and Christianity tied
together by the Brontë sisters. But could it last, could it hold up
against the avalanche of realism and modernism coming out of
industrialism in the Late Victorian Age? Or, from a different angle
let us ask, How did Romanticism die? Or if it&rsquo;s always in the air per
Professor Berlin, how was it driven back underground?
</p>

<p>
Consider the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood founded in 1848, an arguably
Neo-Romantic effort. Below is a later painting of John Everett
Millais, his <i>An Idyll of 1745</i>
</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Everett_Millais#/media/File:An_Idyll_of_1745_(Millais).jpg" target="_blank"><img src="./images/Millais AnIdyllof1745.jpg" width="780" alt="Millais Idyll"></a>
<span class="cap">Before internet social media and hysterical helicopter parents...</span>

<p>
Millais is dealing in what I call <i>profane</i> or <i>vulgar</i> nostalgia, as
opposed to <i>sacred</i> nostalgia, which is a hearkening, yearning for the
profoundly eternal and epic such as mythos and legend. Either way,
nostalgia should not be seen as merely escapism to the past. And yet
we surely will not have our emotion bundles thrummed as Millais
thrummed emotion bundles of that time. Of course the Britain of 1745
had power&#x2014;after favourable political events (e.g., Treaty of
Utrecht) and Robert Walpole&rsquo;s era as prime minister. 1745 was the year
of the main Jacobite rebellion; hence, the patriotic theme? In
general, this was not yet sovereign, domineering Britain; rather, a
Britain still fighting and scrapping for its position in the world,
mainly against the French, as well as still suffering the collective
PTSD of Jacobitism and the bloody seventeenth-century British civil
wars less than a hundred years earlier. Still, Millais painting this
in 1884 would hearkened back, however vulgarly, to, yes, an <i>idyllic</i>
time&#x2014;at least as he thought provided by the seemingly eternal
English countryside, raised up above all as Britain&rsquo;s first and
foremost national treasure. In the semi-wild setting are three
innocent, tabula rasa peasant girls enraptured by an enlisted man
playing a flute, while a fatherly high-born officer looks on
admiringly. Clearly, this pastoral and class bliss was a version of
Britain longed for by the nostalgia-heavy, Romanticism-influenced
Pre-Raphaelites. Great ruing and regretting permeated Victorian
parlour society vis-à-vis the real world, spurring them to search the
earlier Romantic Era and to see in nature vitality and
salvation. Notice to the right Millais&rsquo; <i>The Blind Girl</i>.<label id='fnr.119' for='fnr-in.119.4821788' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>119</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.119.4821788' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>119</sup>

<br>
</span> This
was the down-home England they sought and idealised over the harsh
realities of colonialism and imperialism, the horrific suffering of
the urban industrial wastelands Charles Dickens came to chronicle over
and over throughout this time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;English Zen&rdquo; and English nostalgia against the unrelenting brutality
of the world. Romanticism&rsquo;s right bookend was supposedly 1850. But did
it die, retire, was it replaced? No, no, and no&#x2014;in part, I would
say, exactly because it was never anything as intentional and
wrappable boxable as the watchers and minders wanted it to
be. Romanticism was like an ongoing silent-bid auction always
interrupted just before the sale. So, was nostalgia-heavy Tennyson a
Romanticist? What about Yeats&rsquo; <i>The Stolen Child</i> from 1889
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Come away, O human child!<br>
To the waters and the wild<br>
With a faery, hand in hand,<br>
For the world&rsquo;s more full of weeping than you can understand.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I should also mention James Macpherson&rsquo;s <i>The Poems of Ossian</i>, like
Walpole&rsquo;s <i>Otranto</i>, was the supposed field collections of the
legendary Celtic bard Oisín, although most scholars believe Macpherson
largely composed the poems himself, drawing in part on traditional
Gaelic poetry he had researched. As Wikipedia says
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Though the stories &ldquo;are of endless battles and unhappy loves&rdquo;, the
enemies and causes of strife are given little explanation and
context. Characters are given to killing loved ones by mistake, and
dying of grief, or of joy. There is very little information given on
the religion, culture or society of the characters, and buildings are
hardly mentioned. The landscape &ldquo;is more real than the people who
inhabit it. Drowned in eternal mist, illuminated by a decrepit sun or
by ephemeral meteors, it is a world of greyness.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Yes, Dark, but clearly more of the predominant Medieval Age nostalgia
carried on in the eighteenth century, especially since the
authenticity is highly suspect, i.e., wishful and aggrandising penning
on the part of MacPherson.
</p>

<p>
Arthur Conan Doyle believed in fairies. Julia Margaret Cameron, half
of her life spent after 1850, conjured nostalgia in her
ground-breaking photography with its soft-focus and historical
themes.<label id='fnr.120' for='fnr-in.120.4740000' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>120</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.120.4740000' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>120</sup>

<b>Nostalgia</b>, from Latin, literally means <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homesickness">homesickness</a></i> and
was an acknowledged medical condition in the 1800s.
</span>
morphed into the social-psychological phenomenon of idolising the
past, vulgar nostalgia selectively reviving, reanimating hoped-for
aspects of the past. Nostalgia&rsquo;s motivation? Again, eighteenth-century
gothic doom coincided with the beginning of the Industrial
Revolution&rsquo;s inflexion point, as well as the ghastly reverberations of
colonialism, e.g., slavery. Doom, indeed, as the wages of sin&rsquo;s
ever-compounding interest overwhelms any short-term profits or
gains. Here is how J.R.R. Tolkien responded when his fantasy writings
were called <i>escapist</i>
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Fantasy is escapist, and that is its glory. If a soldier is
imprisoned by the enemy, don’t we consider it his duty to escape?
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Tolkien went on to say the prisoner&rsquo;s natural urge is to escape and
run home. Where is this home? Granted, the intersection of nostalgia
and Dark is minimal, but I say mist dims light, softens lines, and all
nostalgia involves the obscurants mist and shadow. Nostalgia is mainly
for the thrumming of the emotion braid and not hardly the calibration
of the logic train. But yes, home&#x2014;perhaps the home Jane Eyre
described with the Rivers family on the Northern moorlands? Tolkien
as a Neo-Victorian Luddite closet-Monarchist was the next stepping
stone after George MacDonald, Tolkien&rsquo;s idol. So who is a stepping
stone after Tolkien, who before MacDonald?&#x2026; But yes, it is always
about home. Ursula Le Guin said an adult is not a dead child, rather a
child that survived. But can that child in us take a faery
hand-in-hand and return to the water and the wild?  Faerie as a
hyper-idealised European homeland paralleling Abrahamic
Middle-eastern Eden?

Whether the propriety of sacred nostalgia or the handy, heart-warming
profane nostalgia, the eighteenth century saw Nostalgia capitalised as
the West sought to envision, inhabit a home of yore, necessarily bound
to the eternal land and honouring the memories of the ancestors
&#x2026; and all this rather darkly. Indeed, Miss Siddal, we live to know
what is gone.

circling around wisdom &#x2026; almost as if we may find a sanctity in what
may emerge from such consciousness above behaviorist
stimulus-response, action-reaction, beyond the modern gauge of the
personal logic train, beside the day&rsquo;s to-dos&#x2014;orderings, changes,
updates, progress. All comes down to a battle of feeling versus logic
and measurement, vulnerability versus hubris. Retreat through
the mists back to the land versus a well-lit, outward-facing,
conquering logic. Two sides of the same logos? Balance perhaps desires
one side increase to compensate for the other.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps my Romantic Era principals sensed the new
hyper-individualistic, utilitarian, <i>reptilian</i> mindset coming at them
from the middle-class capitalist industrialists and saw it rightly as
an egregious desensitisation regime spreading throughout society. And
so they threw <i>re-sensitisation</i> at it. The stereotypical middle-class
industrialist rising during the Enlightenment was a pragmatic
utilitarian who, after absorbing the message of Adam Smith&rsquo;s <i>The
Wealth of Nations</i> (1776), had shucked off <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noblesse_oblige">noblesse oblige</a>,<label id='fnr.123' for='fnr-in.123.7068879' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>123</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.123.7068879' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>123</sup>

the New Testament beatitudes, and any lingering other-century
nostalgia and sentimentality to forge ahead as the consummate
self-reliant individualist who was laser-focused on financial
wealth. No doubt these types projected a hard, stripped-down emotional
psychological persona, indeed, a new desensitisation
regime. Capitalism, Marxism, modernism in general, dispensed with
traditional aesthetics, forcing my principals to shore up an
aesthetical foundation. But as I say, there was no call to political
action, and really no definite prescription of aesthetics either, just
their fatalist, nostalgic Englishness and Germanity. But could they
succeed? Could they through lines of poetry place something of value
on a level above the fray?

And yet academe&rsquo;s version of so-called Romanticism is still a very big

Again, the Romantic Era is typically fenced between the years
1800 and 1850.
</span> And so
what to do with this beast wont to obfuscate, to blunt and talk to
death the work of my genial, gifted principals? When not <i>completely</i>
missing the Dark Muse point, academia wants to pigeonhole it as gothic
fright. Again, one of the main tasks of WutheringUK is to get Dark out
of its academic and popular media ruts. Nonetheless, we should review
the compartments of the Romanticism box.

<h4 id="org3064c8a">German and English Romanticism: parallel but cross-fertilising?</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3064c8a">
<p>
Romanticism scholars are all over the map with theories. For
example, Andrea Wulf in her <i>Magnificent Rebels</i> depicts Johann
Wolfgang von Goethe as a sort of adult-supervision den dad of the Jena
Set, and yet here is something he actually said about Romanticism
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Klassisch ist das Gesunde, romantisch das Kranke &#x2026; <br>
or further<br>
&#x2026; Romanticism is disease. It is the weak, the sickly, the battle cry
of a school of wild poets and Catholic reactionaries; whereas
classicism is strong, fresh, gay, sound, like Homer and the
<i>Nibelungenlied</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
I won&rsquo;t accuse Wulf of poor research or intentional obfuscation, but
something went wrong with <i>Magnificent Rebels</i>. Having been a founder
of <i>Sturm und Drang</i>, Goethe might have been of two minds. Perhaps he
was initially attracted to all the buzz around Jena, all the <i>haute
pensée</i> sprung up in his backyard, but then soured on its content,
implications, clashed with the personalities behind it. Certainly
Schiller did. Still, Wulf&rsquo;s is a prime example of how diverse, even
contradictory Romantic Era scholarship can be.
</p>

<p>
To be sure, many contemporaries of the actual artistic producers, my
principals, helped talk Romanticism into existence&#x2014;the Jena Set,
Coleridge, Germaine de Staël, Emerson in America, et al.&#x2014;but again,
I believe the actual principals were far-sighted, inward-gazing,
quasi-timeless unicorns not following guidelines nor living up to
anybody&rsquo;s expectations.<label id='fnr.125' for='fnr-in.125.3431587' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>125</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.125.3431587' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>125</sup>
&#x2026;e.g., the Brontës were pastor&rsquo;s daughters in rural West
Yorkshire with little exposure to (taint from?) the cultural and
literary buzz of the cities.
</span> &#x2026; and most certainly they did not
&ldquo;write to spec&rdquo; or pastiche, as was fairly obviously the case with
gothic horror novelists. <i>And so I say once more sifting through all
the academic chaff gets us nowhere versus simply reading and silently
contemplating the product itself</i>. All for naught is the listing of
facts, dates, and figures, creating categories and pigeonholes,
imagining commonalities, generalities, throwing a formulaic hyperplane
over my lone wolf creators. Caveat emptor, I say. If the purpose of a
poem, as Keats said, is to embolden the soul to accept mystery, then
the typical analytic academic death march must be seen as
counterproductive. For me at least, my principals <i>re-sensitised</i>,
while their describers and explainers have only managed to
<i>de-sensitise</i> with their left-brain-bound approach.
</p>

<p>
Some insight to this antagonism comes from two men of that era who
unfortunately wore both creator and explainer hats: Samuel Taylor
Coleridge and Edgar Allan Poe. With them we see how their creations
might take us into the ephemeral mists of Romanticism&rsquo;s subtleties and
sublimities, while their intellectualizations and pontifications
thereof only sound windy, if not shrill out to ridiculous.<label id='fnr.126' for='fnr-in.126.5775292' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>126</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.126.5775292' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>126</sup>
Again, today we have the concept of left-brain, right-brain,
as often enough nothing else can describe this split-personality
confusion. The best ideas about left-right brain are those of Iain
McGilchrist. Try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK7XG3t2nFg&amp;list=PLqBHk3itxyPDKFnwj8-SmlwHra64cCrky&amp;pp=iAQB">these</a>.
</span> And
yet the urban salons of the time necessarily trafficked in rational,
left-brain talk and copy. And this is for me the <i>crisis of
Romanticism</i>, i.e., the huge divide between the creators and their
content versus their contemporary describers and promoters. And so I
say yes Mr Keats, we shall luxuriate long in the lake, but then
slowly, gently swim back to the shore to gracefully and silently rise
out of the water and stand on the bank exulted for the whole
experience. Of course we cannot luxuriate in the lake forever, but
upon dry land we must somehow hold the experience in awe and reverence
and not grasp for logical explanations, which can only turn it into a
show, a farce, even so, a sham, a carcass.

Today a hit song or a TikTok video can go globally &ldquo;viral&rdquo; in less
than a day, with imitations instantly springing up like mushrooms
after rain. However, in the closing years of the eighteenth century
there just seemed to be something in the air, which, fatefully, came
to be called Romanticism, called so first by Jena Set founder
Friedrich Schlegel<label id='fnr.127' for='fnr-in.127.514027' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>127</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.127.514027' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>127</sup>
<a href="https://engines.egr.uh.edu/english-romanticism/what-romanticism">This</a> will save you some googling. Again, note especially the
tortured, left-brained origin of the term <i>romantic</i>.
</span> The prima facie seeds were works from
Coleridge and Wordsworth&rsquo;s collaboration <i>Lyrical Ballads</i> (first
edition) appearing in 1798 and Novalis&rsquo; <i>HttN</i> in 1800. And yet my
principle principal, Emily Brontë, wrote decades later and arguably
knew very little if not absolutely nothing about Jena, Novalis&#x2014;or
even much of Coleridge and Wordsworth other than perhaps a reading of
their <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. Later, Poe is said to have encountered
translations of Ludwig Tieck&rsquo;s short stories. Otherwise,
cross-fertilisation was a sketchy thing. For example, brother and
sister William and Dorothy Wordsworth spent some seven months in
Germany between 1898 and 1899, but were there only to save money and
perhaps learn German. They apparently had no idea of Novalis or Jena
Romanticism starting up at that time!
</p>

<p>
What is called <i>Early German Romanticism</i><label id='fnr.128' for='fnr-in.128.2653827' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>128</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.128.2653827' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>128</sup>
For what it&rsquo;s worth, German Romanticism can be broken down
into Jena, Heidelberg, then Berlin Romanticism based largely on the
principle artists.
</span> began when Novalis&rsquo;
<i>HttN</i> burst upon the scene in the very first year of the nineteenth
century. Clear to me, however, is that <i>HttN</i> was a one-off that came
out of the blue, thus, certainly not intentional, positioned for, or
tailored to any specific trend or agenda. Contrast this with Goethe&rsquo;s
play <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iphigenia_in_Tauris_(Goethe)">Iphigenia in Tauris</a></i> (versions in 1779, 1781, 1786), based on
Euripides&rsquo; original, and specifically meant to showcase Goethe&rsquo;s ideal
of modern classicism, i.e., his and Friedrich Schiller&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weimar_Classicism">Weimar
Classicism</a>.<label id='fnr.129' for='fnr-in.129.5935383' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>129</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.129.5935383' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>129</sup>
Again, Goethe would criticise Romanticism harshly, but
attempted to bridge proto-Romanticm <i>Sturm und Drang</i> with his new
classicism.
</span> Enter the <i>Jena Set</i>, centred around the Schlegel
brothers, August Wilhelm and Friedrich, along with August&rsquo;s wife
Caroline, who seized upon the mostly absentee Novalis as their boy
wonder <i>Liebling</i> mascot&#x2014;and the conflation of producer and
describers began in earnest. But just one year after <i>HttN</i> appeared,
Novalis died on them. Though the seed had sprouted and the Jena Set
went on to create an entire mountain range of Jena Romanticism which
had little to do with their boy-man hero Novalis&rsquo; scattered utterances
and writings. After philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Gottlieb_Fichte">Johann Gottlieb Fichte</a> fell out of
favour, the young, dynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Wilhelm_Joseph_Schelling">Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling</a> came
on board; and it is his <i>nature philosophy</i> which became Jena
Romanticism&rsquo;s house brand, eventually adopted and promoted by
Coleridge (sometimes as literal translation as in his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographia_Literaria">Biographia
Literaria</a> - 1817), then by Emerson and the Transcendentalists in the
Colonies. Again, all of this shambling and churning misses Dark
entirely! Thus, right from the start Dark is obscured behind a wall of
theorising and intellectualisations. Alas.

<img src="images/Edgar_Allan_Poe,_circa_1849,_restored,_squared_off.jpg" alt="Edgar_Allan_Poe,_circa_1849,_restored,_squared_off.jpg">
</span> Alas but the Wikipedia description of DR trots out all
the negative stereotypes of Dark. As one biographer noted, Poe
struggled all his short adult life to make a living as a writer and
poet. One supposed quote of his said
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Your writer of intensities must have very black ink, and a very big
pen, with a very blunt nib.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
My take on Poe was that, as I said above, he led a Dr Jekyll, Mr Hyde
literary existence. The American publishing world was rarely
supportive, as one biographer said, eager to move on from anything
gothic. And yet Poe always seemed to amaze and find though back doors
an audience.
</p>

<p>
Poe&rsquo;s best known poem was <i><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven">The Raven</a></i>, which wound through the
publishing world&#x2014;mainly periodicals and newspapers&#x2014;throughout
1845, finally landing in a collection of Poe&rsquo;s poems in the summer
of 1845. And by the twentieth century, school children would learn by
heart at least the first stanza
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore&#x2014;<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.<br>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis some visitor,&rdquo; I muttered, &ldquo;tapping at my chamber door&#x2014;<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Only this and nothing more.&rdquo;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
and if you were a good student, perhaps even the second stanza
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;<br>
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Eagerly I wished the morrow;&#x2014;vainly I had sought to borrow<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore&#x2014;<br>
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore&#x2014;<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Nameless here for evermore.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
then of course <i>&#x2026;’Tis the wind and nothing more&#x2026;</i> and other such
evocative snatches. For youth poetry reciting contests, <i>The Raven</i> has
been a standard. But through all this we have what is basically a
throwback to the doom-and-gloom Graveyard School gothic, i.e., not
informed by, e.g., Barbauld&rsquo;s finer sort of Dark.
</p>

<p>
Following <i>The Raven</i> came Poe&rsquo;s unfortunate essay entitled <i>The
Philosophy of Composition</i> wherein he attempted to reverse-engineer
what he did to come up with <i>The Raven</i>. Here&rsquo;s a portion
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I had now gone so far as the conception of a Raven, the bird of
ill-omen, monotonously repeating the one word &ldquo;Nevermore&rdquo; at the
conclusion of each stanza in a poem of melancholy tone, and in length
about one hundred lines. Now, never losing sight of the object-
supremeness or perfection at all points, I asked myself, &ldquo;Of all
melancholy topics what, according to the universal understanding of
mankind, is the most melancholy?&rdquo;  Death, was the obvious reply. &ldquo;And
when,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is this most melancholy of topics most poetical?&rdquo; From
what I have already explained at some length the answer here also is
obvious, &ldquo;When it most closely allies itself to Beauty: The death then
of a beautiful woman is unquestionably the most poetical topic in the
world, and equally is it beyond doubt that the lips best suited for
such topic are those of a bereaved lover.&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Alas, but I just cannot accept that he created <i>The Raven</i> on some
mechanised poetry conveyor belt, speaking of Death capitalised, then
the death of a woman almost as if a gimmick. Again, alas. It gets
worse
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Most writers&#x2014;poets in especial&#x2014;prefer having it understood that
they compose by a species of fine frenzy&#x2014;an ecstatic intuition&#x2014;and
would positively shudder at letting the public take a peep behind the
scenes, at the elaborate and vacillating crudities of thought, at the
true purposes seized only at the last moment, at the innumerable
glimpses of idea that arrived not at the maturity of full view, at the
fully-matured fancies discarded in despair as unmanageable, at the
cautious selections and rejections, at the painful erasures and
interpolations&#x2014;in a word, at the wheels and pinions, the tackle for
scene-shifting, the step-ladders, and demon-traps, the cock&rsquo;s
feathers, the red paint and the black patches, which, in ninety-nine
cases out of a hundred, constitute the properties of the literary
histrio [actor, player].
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Cringe. He sounds ashamed about falling into a state of &ldquo;ecstatic
intuition,&rdquo; as if he is surrounded by peers around whom he had better
not sound too airy-floaty. Or maybe he wanted to say, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas
nothing. Just follow my formula, and you too can write a nice, dark
poem that&rsquo;ll have them all weeping.&rdquo; Super cringe.
</p>

<p>
Personally, I do believe <i>The Raven</i> came from something
ecstatic&#x2014;out to trance and vision. Again, Poe was simply an erratic
character who seemed to change personalities often. But sometimes I
want <i>The Raven</i> to be about the death of Romanticism. If academe says
the last breath escaped circa 1850, then perhaps I could read into the
lines a lamenting of the passing of an era symbolised by a beautiful,
virtuous woman Leanore. Allow me, please.
</p>

<p>
And so here I want to make a very important point about my principals,
to be sure, <i>that they were only vessels,</i> those particular mortals
the Muses chose to be their emissaries. This angle is well developed
in the Hollywood film <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)">Amadeus</a></i> where Mozart<label id='fnr.131' for='fnr-in.131.2838594' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>131</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.131.2838594' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>131</sup>

<br>
</span> was depicted as
an immature, outta-control brat, while all the same the conduit of
heavenly music. As alluded above, Novalis was likely just such a
boy-wonder Amadeus sort, Poe often enough mercurial, Emily Brontë
austere anorexic, Emily Dickinson a spinster recluse. Looking too
closely into their personal stories gets us no closer to discovering
the origins of their inspiration&#x2014;in other words, another academe
dead end, so leave off already! As writer and artist Kahil Gibran said
about children in his <i>The Prophet</i>, they come <i>through</i> us, they are
not <i>of</i> us.
</p>

<p>
Though Poe&rsquo;s own descriptions of his &ldquo;place of creative origin&rdquo; was
surprisingly insightful. He once mentioned the state of having
&ldquo;thoughts behind thoughts.&rdquo; Which is something I found described in a
<a href="https://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/neuregulin-1-genie-und-schizophrenie-moeglicherweise-folge-eines-gens-a-870089.html"><i>Der Spiegel</i> article</a> from 2012 about the link between creativity and
<i>schizophrenia</i>. Basically, an &ldquo;expression&rdquo; of the gene Neuregulin 1
(NRG1), which supposedly is key in regulating &ldquo;synaptic plasticity&rdquo;
can sometimes be amiss, but not so amiss that full-on schizophrenia
results. Instead of full debilitation with phantom voices and raging
paranoia, a &ldquo;schizoid lite&rdquo; sufferer will have the hidden underground
river of wild disassociated thoughts, but be able to control it, even
tap into it. After reading this Der Spiegel article scales fell from
my eyes&#x2014;it described me! Here is an example of a poem I wrote
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Dark burgundy roses, cobalt irises<br>
Delivered for the night&rsquo;s performance,<br>
To the theatre in the hollow, <b><i>le théâtre de la combe</i></b>.<br>
Village-bound now, the hollow once a fairy circle,<br>
Long since fairy dream haunted.<br>
Look down from the sacred grove, now the square.<br>
Recall the one attendance as a child:<br>
Visions of darker, older nights since.<br>
<br>
Escape to the countryside;<br>
Great sunlight to dispel dark fairy rumour.<br>
Yet the pale blue sky but tissue, the thinnest canopy.<br>
Indigo lace swirling, grey clouds, fog billowing.<br>
Incessant winds to lift and shred the canopy<br>
Till starless void revealed&#x2026;<br>
<br>
&#x2026; darkness, and a chill wind rises up<br>
The cobblestone <i>ruelle</i> from the hollow.<br>
On this night of many nights as one,<br>
Dark purple clouds stripe a moon large and orange,<br>
Placed just above <i>le théâtre de la combe</i>.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
As far as describing my creative process I remember becoming fixated
upon a nighttime scene of a narrow, winding, cobblestone,
other-century street and a small theatre therein. And the rest simply
came from the underground river of <i>thought rumour</i> below my direct
consciousness. For further evidence I might add a section of my novel
<i>Emily of Wolkeld</i>. Here is Emily describing her special place
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
She gazed once more at the broken outline of Wolkeld Hall through the
trees, letting her concentration slip and her eyes glaze. She
listened after that strange place in her mind from which bits
and pieces of scenes played beyond her comprehension, where
shadows of thoughts never quite became clear. Though at times
something would suddenly stand before her and demand her best
attempt at a poetisation.
</p>

<p>
Since Kansas, since puberty, she would occasionally find herself
slipping into some further space beyond the secret compartments. But
again, she could only sense, partially comprehend this expansive,
twilit region, fleeting, but long dominating her heart and mind. At
first she considered such flights just intense day-dreaming, but over
time they became less imagined, more a definite communion with a
distinctly separate realm. It was a dusky world, steeped in sublime
melancholic loneliness, often large and panoramic. At first she found
it worrisome&#x2014;not some clear religious transport of light and
ecstasy. And yet she came to believe good was speaking, not evil, nor
for that matter any sort of lurking mental illness. She wished it to
be something of her soul’s true home, perhaps some distant view of
Cumbria&#x2014;at least that was the place to which she always mapped it,
for which she yearned immediately thereafter.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The queen of this sort of <i>Schizophrenia Lite™</i> is of course Emily
Dickinson, whose lines often disappear into this underground
region. Reading her hundreds of little one-, two-, three-stanza bursts
leaves me certain she was definitely Schizo-lite™
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
A thought went up my mind to-day<br>
That I have had before,<br>
But did not finish, &#x2014; some way back,<br>
I could not fix the year,<br>
<br>
Nor where it went, nor why it came<br>
The second time to me,<br>
Nor definitely what it was,<br>
Have I the art to say.<br>
<br>
But somewhere in my soul, I know<br>
I&rsquo;ve met the thing before;<br>
It just reminded me &#x2014; &rsquo;t was all &#x2014;<br>
And came my way no more.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Bright gems, one after the other, poured out of that terribly gentle,
unimaginably deep woman. Sigh&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Now, on to what I consider Poe&rsquo;s best poem, namely, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annabel_Lee">Annabel Lee</a></i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>

&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;By the name of Annabel Lee;<br>
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Than to love and be loved by me.<br>
<br>
I was a child and she was a child,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
But we loved with a love that was more than love&#x2014;<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;I and my Annabel Lee&#x2014;<br>
With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Coveted her and me.<br>
<br>
And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
So that her highborn kinsmen came<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;And bore her away from me,<br>
To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea.<br>
<br>
The angels, not half so happy in Heaven,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Went envying her and me—<br>
Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.<br>
<br>
But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of those who were older than we&#x2014;<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of many far wiser than we&#x2014;<br>
And neither the angels in Heaven above<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Nor the demons down under the sea<br>
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
<br>
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride,<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In her sepulchre there by the sea&#x2014;<br>
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;In her tomb by the sounding sea.<br>

If there is a better American example of the Dark Muse, I don&rsquo;t know
it. Here Poe is contemplative melancholic, rather than flogging fright
as he does in his prose. I wonder if Poe knew of Novalis and his
supposed one hundred nights of graveside vigilance for deceased Sophie
von Kühn? Perhaps, but irrelevant. Again, I suss out that both Poe and
Emily Brontë grasped the Dark Muse and found expression through their
poetry&#x2014;but, again, so ironically, not through their prose where they
could only fall back into gothic handle-cranking. And so I fall back
to poetry and fragmented bursts as the only vehicle of true Dark.
</p>

<p>
I would add that Poe, of my principle principals, was undoubtedly the
best educated and informed. He would have known Greek mythology best,
i.e., all about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanatos">Thanatos</a>, Nyx, Hypnos, the Underworld and, in general,
the classic Greek proto-gothic take on death and night. And yet he
delivers in his <i>Annabel Lee</i> our new sort of Dark Muse.<label id='fnr.132' for='fnr-in.132.3766422' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>132</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.132.3766422' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>132</sup>
Academe is also wont to play around with Freud&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_drive">death drive</a>
(<i>Todestrieb</i>), another red herring completely antithetical to
everything I&rsquo;m about here with WutheringUK. If anyone didn&rsquo;t get

Here I will simply and plainly state (gush) that Emily Jane Brontë is
the very centre of my Dark Muse. Through just a handful of her poems
she embodies for me the heart and soul of what I consider <i>base</i> Dark
and <i>real</i> Romanticism. But as mentioned above, she has largely been
left out of any Romanticism boxing or packaging.<label id='fnr.133' for='fnr-in.133.3390786' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>133</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.133.3390786' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>133</sup>
&#x2026;a blessing perhaps?
</span>
</p>

<p>
Though many are surprised when I say forget her book <i>Wuthering
Heights</i>, which for me is just stock old-school gothic, however
artistically potent we may find it.<label id='fnr.134' for='fnr-in.134.8329943' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>134</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.134.8329943' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>134</sup>
Let me finally mention here that the word <i>wuthering</i> is
&ldquo;Northern&rdquo; dialect for the wind blowing; from late Middle English
<i>whither</i>, <i>wuther</i> &ldquo;rush, make a rushing sound&rdquo;, probably of
Scandinavian origin; or <i>whithering</i> comes from the Old Norse and
means roaring like the wind on a stormy day. This is the sort of
<i>wuthering</i> I&rsquo;m using in my title <i>WutheringUK</i>, i.e., I&rsquo;m not
referencing the book.
</span> I said this before&#x2014;and,
yes, it may seem odd and counter-intuitive&#x2014;but prose, loaded down
with depictions of human mundanity as it must be, is doomed, as it
simply cannot do for Dark what poetry can. Likewise, Poe lost much
altitude when he would switch from poetry to prose&#x2014;however much fame
he might have won from his short stories. I insist Brontë and Poe said
deep and lasting things about the Dark Muse in their lyric verse, but
really only added pulp to the gothic shelf with their
storytelling. Again, I insist gothic is a second-hand derivative, a
Platonic cave shadow of true Dark. Yes, blasphemy to many of you, but
as always, YMMV, your mileage may vary&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Of course there&rsquo;s no denying the human being is very
narrative-oriented. Basically, we crave <i>original time</i> mythology. But
a telling, a story must be of legend import and gestalt;<label id='fnr.135' for='fnr-in.135.127195' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>135</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.135.127195' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>135</sup>
<i>Gestalt</i> in the sense of form, pattern,
configuration. Perhaps as well legends are comprised of <i>atoms</i> of
legend stuff, etc. More on &ldquo;legend receptor sites&rdquo; later.
</span>
otherwise, it runs the risk of being confusing, misleading, that is to
say <i>false</i> legend, exciting our psychic legend receptor sites,
stirring up archetypes, only to lead us hither and thither, but in the
end doing us no real service for all the innervation. Which eventually
can only lead to burnout and collective madness.<label id='fnr.136' for='fnr-in.136.5944073' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>136</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.136.5944073' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>136</sup>

is meaningless when compared to the mythical sacred times of
origin. In effect, mundane life is meaningless, thus, its accumulation
of &ldquo;events&rdquo; are also meaningless, even oppressive destructive for
those still trapped in linear time and a strictly mundane
interpretation of life and reality.
</span> Not kidding. But as has (thankfully!) often happened
in my life, this encounter knocked another layer of scales from my

</p>

<p>
One quick in-place aside. It is terribly ironic how we would never
have known Emily Brontë&rsquo;s poetry had not big sister Charlotte pilfered
her manuscripts from their hiding place and had them published without
Emily&rsquo;s permission. Similarly, the reclusive Emily Dickinson only saw
some ten poems published, but after her death <i>over a seventeen
hundred</i> were discovered in her room and subsequently published. And
so I wonder, how many Barbaulds, Brontës, Dickinsons, Poes fell back
under the waves never to be known? As with so many like the Amherst
and Haworth Emilies, <i>we found them, they didn&rsquo;t find us</i>. Alas.
</p>

<p>
Let me restart by saying Haworth Emily combined in her <i>poetry</i>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Nature</b>,</li>
<li><b>Dark</b>, and</li>
<li><b>Christianity</b></li>
</ul>

<p>
though in keeping with Keats&rsquo; <i>Negative Capability</i>, no one or two
overshadowed the other two or one. Let&rsquo;s imagine a doughty frontier
one-room school teacher who forces the rowdy peasant boys of
blood-feuding families, Dark, Nature, and Christianity, to sit next to
each other on the school bench and work together. And so I urge you to
simply get the Penguin Classics <i>Emily Brontë The Complete Poems</i> and
read and read and never stop reading Haworth Emily over and over. And
in so doing you will hopefully be able to make this magical Negative
Capability suspension of Nature, Dark, and Christianity hover above
your own heart and mind. Problematic, however, is how some forty-four
of her poems are referencing her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracosm">paracosm</a>, her fantasy land

<p>
Hmm, just more of that strangely flowery, antique-sounding stuff from
back then. And so you may wonder why I assign such importance to these
lines, how they could contain an entire philosophy. As I&rsquo;ve said
before, I believe Emily Brontë, being such a marginal, hard-pressed
little bat was singularly qualified to speak to us today. She being
introverted, marginal, unassuming, and yet fiercely determined, stood
during those short years of her life (no doubt unwittingly) at the
nexus of a perfect storm of history, social-psychology, and culture.
</p>

<p>
I spoke previously of <i>The night is darkening round me</i> (as well as
her <i>All creation is equally mad&#x2026;</i> quote), and I&rsquo;ll reiterate that
in this one poem she expresses the Dark Muse so very well. First, she
is dealing directly with natural, <i>source</i> Dark&#x2014;as Nature is the
source of Dark&#x2014;and not just packaging the icons, prompts, and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasmagoria">phantasmagoric</a> symbols of gothic Dark. She is subservient to, in total
awe of this phenomenon of stormy darkness descending. She owns being
small, insignificant, overwhelmed, overpowered. This is not the
melodramatic resignation of Edward Young, not doom or woe-is-me
fatalism, not the serene reflection of Night School Barbauld. Nor is
she spiritual or reverent per se, which dominates the following two
poems. Instead, she is captivated by something beyond her control,
something seemingly extra-spiritual. She describes a powerful liminal
space created naturally by darkness descending during a snow storm,
wherein she senses a vast mystery and sublimity. Again, if we are the
man who has divorced his wife, but calls her every day, this evening
is one of those rare and portentous phone conversations. Darkness
coming down upon the wild, natural setting transports her, calls out
and speaks to her real self, presenting not just a fleeting <i>presence
of eternal harmony</i> moment, rather, contact with a <i><b>world</b> of eternal
mystery</i>. And yes, that world is Dark.
</p>

<p>
As discussed above, there is the basic Wordsworthian homage to Nature,
i.e., episodes of swooning over, riffing on, paying compliments to an
outdoor scene, e.g., Wordsworth&rsquo;s <i>Tintern Abbey</i>. Emily, however, has
been arrested, even rendered lame by Nature&rsquo;s commanding presence
symbolised as a tyrant&rsquo;s spell. And being so much under this tyrant&rsquo;s
spell belies a crisis. A liminal phase phenomenon<label id='fnr.142' for='fnr-in.142.6222592' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>142</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.142.6222592' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>142</sup>
&#x2026;more about <i>liminal</i> just ahead&#x2026;
</span> has
overthrown her mundane, rational human regimen to accost her heart and
mind with something of some incomprehensible Beyond.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, if she were truly marginal and bat-like, not so very anchored,
not so bought into the &ldquo;real,&rdquo; mundane world, if she had <i>shunned the
common paths that other run</i>,<label id='fnr.143' for='fnr-in.143.2662863' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>143</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.143.2662863' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>143</sup>
&#x2026;as per her poem <i>Plead for me</i>
</span> then this twilight storm across
the previously benign wastelands would surely have confronted her with
a compelling alternative to the profane, real world. Instead of an
&ldquo;everywhere,&rdquo; mapped and ultimately dominated by humans, she glimpses
an &ldquo;everywhen&rdquo; rooted in the eternal. It would seem Emily&rsquo;s &ldquo;God of
Visions&rdquo; has blessed her. And so we have this everywhen rumour of some
higher world whereof the frail, enthralled narrator may only catch
glimpses presented so compellingly in this short, three-stanza lyrical
poem. Similar to Keller&rsquo;s <i>Winter Evening</i> described above, we may
then wonder how the observer will proceed in life, so overwhelming as
she describes the encounter. Her lines surely embolden the soul to <i>be
in</i> mystery. She creates the intrigue of Dark, she frames mystery by
poetically encoding deep insight borne of experience, of
vulnerability, and ultimately transport.

<br>
</span> likewise speaks of Nature&rsquo;s power as
darkness descends. However, Droste means to bring to us the <i>fear</i> of
nature as a superstitious peasant lad would experience it. Here is my
free prose translation of the first stanza
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
How ominous it is to cross the moor, when its haze, its mists writhing like phantoms bind and weave through the low growth; and up comes a springlet beneath every step, a hissing sung from the ground. How eerie it is to cross the moor when the reeds rustle in the breezes&#x2026;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
&#x2026;wild nature so ominously forsaken, so frighteningly forsaken. But
whence this ominous, frightening, and forsaken? Whence the backstory
superstitions? Droste narrates a peasant lad&rsquo;s scary twilight trip
across a semi-wild section of his early-nineteenth century Westphalian
lowlands, describing in terrifying detail how the landscape would seem
to come alive with terrible demonic threats. In the next five verses
the boy succumbs in his growing panic to fantasies of evil spirits and
bad actors; but in the end he makes it back&#x2014;with perhaps some help
from his guardian angel&#x2014;to Christian civilization. I bring up
<i>Der Knabe</i> here because both Brontë and Droste are working with
Nature as a <i>liminal phase</i> that has suddenly eclipsed a known,
mundane, daylit locality, becoming either a spell-binding gate to a
higher realm or a downright frightening reintroduction to the
forbidden pagan past.
</p>

<p>
In both cases the landscape is not some far-removed trackless
wilderness only approachable by Earth-astronaut explorers, rather,
marginal, abandoned spaces. These are not the geographically-dominant
forests of pre-history, wild and savage and brimming with animistic
spirits. Rather, centuries of Christian indoctrination and rationalist
science have come between the human and the greatly shrunken wild
places.
</p>

<p>
But then neither Brontë out in the storm nor Droste&rsquo;s lost boy
suffered under today&rsquo;s normative anthropocentrism where nature is so
completely contained and explained, so completely demystified. The
liminality channelling once dominant Nature is impacting, gripping yet
impressionable humans. However, we today, so deeply embedded in our
space-station, quasi-Jetsons-like existences, cannot fully appreciate
the eeriness, the out-of-time-and-space transport of someone two
hundred years prior. Nature has impacted, gripped Emily and Annette&rsquo;s
boy as few of us so deep in our rationalist, desensitised,
disassociated mindsets can be reached. And so most of us today will
simply scoff at such experiences as succumbing to irrationalism or
superstition. Both <i>The night is darkening round me</i> and <i>Knaben im
Moor</i> speak to a proto-nostalgia for nature&rsquo;s power and dominance, a
harkening back to a union and tracking with the land that our weaker,
more dissipated, more muddled modern nostalgic impulses cannot plumb.
</p>

<p>
Let&rsquo;s take an aside to talk about the very important concept of
<i>liminal space</i>. Here&rsquo;s a quote found on Reddit from the member
&ldquo;Killcode2&rdquo; explaining what a liminal space is
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Imagine a classroom from your childhood. Surely you are imagining it
in the day, with sunlight spilling in through the windows and kids
shuffling to their desks. This is the state in which a classroom is
most frequently seen and serves a purpose for. Now imagine sneaking
into your school late at night and everything is empty. It is almost
eerie seeing the same classroom at night in a totally different
context. Suddenly its usual purpose has been robbed and it is just a
room&#x2014;but not quite. Because now it also feels strangely alien and
enigmatic to you, a purposeless, otherworldly architecture. The next
day that room would be back to normal, in its default state. It is
back to being a real classroom. But that middle phase it was in when
you saw it in the night, it&rsquo;s a <b>liminal phase</b>, a state of
transition. And often spaces like that carry eerie characteristics,
such as being out of time and out of place. That&rsquo;s liminal spaces for
you. The same could apply for an abandoned mall, an overgrown tree
house, or a swimming pool with all the water gone in the winter.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
We can imagine Droste&rsquo;s boy growing up to be a simple, devout
Westphalian Roman Catholic who lived out the rest of his life under
the lurking fear and dread of that one liminal phase encounter of his
otherwise simple and familiar moorland. He probably instilled this
fear in his children and grandchildren&#x2014;just as his head had been
filled by the adults around him with legends and stories passed down
for generations&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
Droste offers us this commoner take on wilds, i.e., a basic
civilization-bound human reaction to nature. The Church, having
quashed pagan spirituality by ascribing it to Satan, the root of all
evil, ensured that what was wild and far enough removed from the
church and its Eucharist in the altar tabernacle would be associated
with evil and threat. The word <i>heathen</i> (German <i>heidnisch</i>) is
derived from <i>heath</i> (<i>Heide</i>)&#x2014;and there we have a direct link
between wilds and pagan, hence evil. And so to venture out on the
heath was to venture into (formerly?) heathen-dominated spaces. Again,
a peasant of Droste&rsquo;s era had no such Earth astronaut mindset as we do
today. To him the awful spirit world of his distant pagan ancestors
was just barely held in check by Jesus and the saints. Where is the
devil? Everywhere! &#x2014; <i>especially</i> out on the heath after dark!
</p>

<p>
Droste underlines a seemingly great limitation of our understanding of
nature, of life itself, namely, the vast majority of us are, and
probably always will be, grossly susceptible to irrationality. As an
aristocrat, she understood that in order to lead the commoners, to
hold the reins, the aristocrat must understand their functional
limitations, and subsequently <i>cannot ask them to do what they cannot
do, nor go where they cannot go, nor understand what they cannot

evil after dark, full stop. No attempt at disabusing the commoner of
superstitions is really possible. Droste&rsquo;s is a stasis attitude, thus,
keep things simple and steady is the mantra of the day.<label id='fnr.146' for='fnr-in.146.3936270' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>146</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.146.3936270' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>146</sup>
Sometimes I can&rsquo;t help but feel America is just a land of
lost peasants who have failed at rising above peasant ignorance and
can&rsquo;t figure out where to go other than into evermore materialism,
i.e., the exercise of peasant hoarding&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<p>
We may contrast this with Emily Brontë&rsquo;s more Protestant-influenced
understanding of her heath. Hers was not the immemorial Catholic
peasant mentality, rather, that of an informed Protestant cleared of
the eisegesis,<label id='fnr.147' for='fnr-in.147.5642681' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>147</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.147.5642681' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>147</sup>
&#x2026;reading into Biblical scripture what one subjectively
wants to believe, as opposed to <i>exegesis</i>, which purportedly is
exactly what the original author meant.
</span> post-scripture metaphysics supposedly
dominating Catholicism. To give an indication of how different
Catholics and Protestants are on metaphysical phenomena, consider how
thousands of saints are officially recognised by the Catholic
church&#x2014;most having qualified as saintly due to some metaphysical,
paranormal religious experience.<label id='fnr.148' for='fnr-in.148.1334109' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>148</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.148.1334109' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>148</sup>
The well-known German liqueur <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A4germeister#Label">Jägermeister</a></i> features a stag
with a glowing crucifix between its antlers, which originated from an
apparition seen by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubertus">Saint Hubertus</a>. <br>

<br>
</span> Saintless Protestants, on the
other hand, would seem to exclude anything paranormal miraculous not
mentioned directly in the Old or New Testament of the Bible. Here is
Günter Grass from his novel <i>The Flounder</i> speaking of a priestess of
prehistoric pagan times in his homeland Vistula river delta on the
Baltic Sea
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Because she was a cook, Mestwina was also a priestess. She raised the
cult of Awa to perfection. And when it came time for us all to be
baptized, she brewed up paganism and Christianity into a Catholic
mixture.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Like the making of sausage, Grass indicates Catholicism has a few
&ldquo;early&rdquo; ingredients we might not want to see.
</p>

<p>
To be sure, a Brontë sister at the dawn of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s reign
drank a much more filtered and distilled brew. The night Emily
describes is certainly putting on a stormy show, but she is not facing
pagan spirits that had never really quit the Westphalian boy&rsquo;s
landscape. For both, Nature surely takes command, but one witness
wants out and the other is frozen in place, if not wanting in. It
might be said Emily is experiencing something like what Mary felt at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecce_Ancilla_Domini">The Annunciation</a> or Moses with the burning bush. But Emily creates a
new sort of metaphysics, namely, sans religiosity, with Dark at its
center. And so what greater connection with, what response can a
post-Enlightenment human have to Nature other than to be so completely
and deeply transfixed that, for some moments at least, one cannot go,
cannot go? And that power? Some manner of Darkness like no one had
ever seen or experienced&#x2014;not the Night School, and certainly not the
gothic before. Emily is not reposing in mosses to behold greenery as
did Wordsworth; indeed, this is a more elemental, even violent Nature
taking over. With <i>The night&#x2026;</i> Emily Brontë has faced down the
age-old fear and threat to become some new citizen, ward of Nature,
this coinciding with the Industrial Age. <i>Hers is a post-pagan Nature
worship</i>, some graduation ceremony. And as I must again emphasise,
<i>this Nature is seen, experienced as Dark</i> with boughs weighted down
and shaking in a storm, not daffodils flopping around in a gentle
breeze. Indeed, Dark is now a portentous liminal space experience
brought even further than the Night School. With Droste we see liminal
mystery writhing in existential fear, while Brontë bares her throat to
Nature to surf that fear. And, indeed, at us rushes Dark like never
before&#x2014;or since. Liminal space Nature: Tolkien takes us to his
nighttime Lothlorien elves, H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s to cosmic demons, but
Brontë to a pure, all but metaphysically neutral Dark realm. She is
completely sans New Age, sans pseudo-shamanic, i.e., totally bereft of
our modern spiritual grandiosity, rather, she opens the Dark Muse like
never before.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8dfee0a">
<p>
&#x2026;then Nature is swapped out for Christianity as <i>I&rsquo;ll come when thou
art saddest</i> commences. By the early eighteen-hundreds Christianity
has held the torch of spirituality ever since it buried Euro-paganism
after the fall of the Roman Empire. But has it ever figured out what
to do with this torch other than march around demanding us to fall in
behind? One obvious issue is metaphysics&#x2014;what is Christian
metaphysics and how much should there be in lieu of our burgeoning
materialism based on science and technology? And as I say,
Protestantism first and foremost cut the metaphysical down even closer
to the bone that had Catholicism from animist paganism. And all this
Christian piety, reverence, holiness, conservatism, this bare, plain,
minimalism, this <i>severity</i> &#x2026; doesn&rsquo;t it all just add up to a
holding pattern while we go through our increasingly abstracted,
removed, post-Nature lives? But as I just described, Nature and Dark
became participatory in a new way as the Night darkened round Emily.
</p>

<p>
In <i>I’ll come when thou art saddest</i>, Haworth Emily is hearing a very
punitive, severe, grim God who would seem to arrive only in the
human&rsquo;s most dire moments, when, supposedly, <i>real feeling has
entirely unbiased sway</i>. Only when we are saddest, alone, in the dark,
close to our demise does our supreme better, our lord, come to His
lesser mortal&rsquo;s side for consultation. Only then do the strange
sensations roll as precursors to a &ldquo;sterner&rdquo; power. Which leaves us to
believe all previous times were clouded, ambiguous, dominated by
wayward willfulness, foolishness, in other words, utter
meaninglessness. In any event, Haworth Emily again plumbs a new
depth. A new dimension is opened to life&rsquo;s precariousness, to the
eternal enigma of free will versus mortality frail and brief as it
is.
</p>

<p>
Has anyone ever spoken of God in a more mature, consequential, and
unrelentingly austere way? Perhaps God is gentle and
compassionate&#x2014;but Haworth Emily does not hide away the awful,
miserable, grim, and desperate of life as necessary precursors for
this particular visitation, regardless of any subsequent mercy and
salvation. Here we have suffering and demise lowering our human folly,
scrapping our conceits, smashing our will &#x2026; to open our soul for
that flood of strange sensations that would herald a union with the
Creator. Almighty God would seem to say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a desperate
moment. Control of your life has flown. At last we can get down to
business.&rdquo; Emily clearly implies in these eighty-seven words that we
are like a dog that has broken his leash and run wild, but now in his
hour of need, he has returned to his master.
</p>

<p>
Surely Haworth Emily had heard preachers thunder from the pulpit of
God&rsquo;s terrible wrath as they quoted various violent passages from the
Old Testament&#x2014;the whole Old Testament &ldquo;God was pleased, God was
displeased&rdquo; thing. But the God our Brontë is describing has arrived to
calmly discuss His will, to introduce His sterner power towards that
end. Doom is certainly in the air, but this Brontëan version is
graduated from common gothic melodrama. The isolated, suffering human
is experiencing an ultimate doom, completely void of any gothic
dress-up. God in this moment is the keenest reality we can know, a
private death-bed event of the utmost consequence. Still, the human is
<i>before</i> any sign of redemption and forgiveness, pre-mercy as it were,
and so is threatened by this truest doom&#x2026; And most strikingly,
<i>there is little to none of the &ldquo;good news&rdquo; of Jesus in this corner of
the Brontëan world</i>. Emily no truck with Christ; Charlotte no truck
with missionaries;<label id='fnr.149' for='fnr-in.149.585455' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>149</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.149.585455' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>149</sup>
&#x2026;based on her unflattering portrayal of St John Rivers&rsquo;
drive to be a missionary in India in <i>Jane Eyre</i>.
</span> Anne floating passive and resigned&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
I believe no one sees God quite like Haworth Emily did, no one in or
out of scripture has described a more ominous and material meeting of
God and man. But then with whom could she have ever spoken about such
things? Her cleric father? Doubtful, he too much the Church of England
company man.<label id='fnr.150' for='fnr-in.150.9222949' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>150</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.150.9222949' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>150</sup>
I can see the Reverend Patrick coming away from a theological
discussion with his braincase daughters theatrically shaking his head,
muttering, &ldquo;Oh, my daughters!&rdquo; to hearty laughter.
</span> Charlotte, Anne? Perhaps. And yet some impasse
might have prevented that, antagonisms, <i>codependency</i> ruts as we might
now say. After all, she hid most of her poetry from the world. Here is
another insight into her mind, a poem called <i>The Philosopher</i>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&rsquo;Enough of thought, philosopher!<br>
Too long hast thou been dreaming<br>
Un[en]lightened, in this chamber drear,<br>
While summer’s sun is beaming!<br>
Space-sweeping soul, what sad refrain<br>
Concludes thy musings once again?<br>
<br>
&rsquo;&ldquo;Oh, for the time when I shall sleep<br>
Without identity.<br>
And never care how rain may steep,<br>
Or snow may cover me!<br>
No promised heaven, these wild desires<br>
Could all, or half fulfil;<br>
No threatened hell, with quenchless fires,<br>
Subdue this quenchless will!&rdquo;<br>
<br>
&rsquo;So said I, and still say the same;<br>
Still, to my death, will say&#x2014;<br>
Three gods, within this little frame,<br>
Are warring night; and day;<br>
Heaven could not hold them all, and yet<br>
They all are held in me;<br>
And must be mine till I forget<br>
My present entity!<br>
Oh, for the time, when in my breast<br>
Their struggles will be o’er!<br>
Oh, for the day, when I shall rest,<br>
And never suffer more!<br>
<br>
&rsquo;I saw a spirit, standing, man,<br>
Where thou dost stand&#x2014;an hour ago,<br>
And round his feet three rivers ran,<br>
Of equal depth, and equal flow&#x2014;<br>
A golden stream&#x2014;and one like blood;<br>
And one like sapphire seemed to be;<br>
But, where they joined their triple flood<br>
It tumbled in an inky sea<br>
The spirit sent his dazzling gaze<br>
Down through that ocean&rsquo;s gloomy night;<br>
Then, kindling all, with sudden blaze,<br>
The glad deep sparkled wide and bright&#x2014;<br>
White as the sun, far, far more fair<br>
Than its divided sources were!<br>
<br>
&rsquo;And even for that spirit, seer,<br>
I’ve watched and sought my life-time long;<br>
Sought him in heaven, hell, earth, and air,<br>
An endless search, and always wrong.<br>
Had I but seen his glorious eye<br>
ONCE light the clouds that wilder me;<br>
I ne&rsquo;er had raised this coward cry<br>
To cease to think, and cease to be;<br>
I ne&rsquo;er had called oblivion blest,<br>
Nor stretching eager hands to death,<br>
Implored to change for senseless rest<br>
This sentient soul, this living breath&#x2014;<br>
Oh, let me die&#x2014;that power and will<br>
Their cruel strife may close;<br>
And conquered good, and conquering ill<br>
Be lost in one repose!&rsquo;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
I won&rsquo;t say here is a counter-example, though it belies a very strong
willed person who will make her mental and spiritual breakthrough or
fall into despair. She will resolve her three-way cognitive
dissonance, or insist on oblivion. What then are these three rivers
this self-loathing voice speaks of? Presumptuous of me to assume they
are Dark, Nature, and Christianity. But I have no doubt her mind was,
indeed, wracked by conflicting thoughts, cognitive dissonances, which
she could not always bear as serenely as Keats would have
wanted. Though this willfulness is not that of egotism or
pettiness. She berates fate, God, eternity for not giving her at least
one moment of the eternal harmony of her three rivers united. Honest
petulance.

<div id="outline-container-org5fa8ea5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5fa8ea5">I would have touched the heavenly key&#x2026;</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5fa8ea5">
<p>
Repeating,
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I would have touched the heavenly key<br>
That spoke alike of bliss and thee;<br>
I would have woke the entrancing song,<br>
But its words died upon my tongue.<br>
But then I knew that he stood free,<br>
Would never speak of joy again,<br>
And then I felt&#x2026;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Perhaps she would have put more faith, more stock in Jesus, or in
salvation while living, or in the tantalising promises of Heaven. But
again, she could not mouth along with the supposed &ldquo;good news&rdquo; of
Christ. Bliss might be fleetingly known while on Earth, but woe and
doom must be endured to the bitter end, as a expurgate of pride,
foolishness, and sinfulness as the fate of a race too weak, too
unworthy of even glimpses of heavenly bliss. Again, she is all about
the refinement of doom. Again, doom is not a fright gimmick as with
the pulp gothic.
</p>

<p>
We may not think of Heaven while on Earth. To be sure, nothing new
here, hers just another rendition of the sinful mortal&rsquo;s
unworthiness. God has so constructed our earthly &ldquo;starter&rdquo; experience,
and we musn&rsquo;t get ahead of ourselves. I see this seemingly grim
surrender, this abstinence bent elsewhere in her poetry, her resolve
to stay on Earth even after death is a new level of humility.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Heber">Reginald Heber</a>&rsquo;s <i>Holy, Holy, Holy! Lord God Almighty!</i>, an moving
hymn would have died upon Emily&rsquo;s tongue, as she seemingly eschewed
any indulgence of imaginings of heaven and God&rsquo;s majesty while serving
out her earthly existence
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!<br>
Early in the morning our song shall rise to Thee;<br>
Holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!<br>
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!<br>
<br>
Holy, holy, holy! all the saints adore Thee,<br>
casting down their golden crowns around the glassy sea;<br>
cherubim and seraphim, falling down before Thee,<br>
which wert and art and evermore shalt be.<br>
<br>
Holy, holy, holy! though the darkness hide Thee,<br>
though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see;<br>
only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee,<br>
perfect in pow&rsquo;r, in love, and purity.<br>
<br>
Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty!<br>
All Thy works shall praise Thy name, in earth and sky and sea;<br>
Holy, holy, holy! merciful and mighty!<br>
God in three Persons, blessed Trinity!<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Dutiful Anne would have sung properly. Charlotte perhaps less so. But
Emily might have only mouthed the words. No coward soul was hers,
faith so very strong&#x2014;but then this Christian triumphalist
boosterism, this perfunctory marching behind the Christian torch
probably left her in a state of ennui.<label id='fnr.151' for='fnr-in.151.9195633' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>151</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.151.9195633' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>151</sup>
And yet <a href="https://youtu.be/2qCmtUhiKcA?si=12R2dDiYdqwRZ-GG">this version</a> might very well have cringed out all
three of the Christian minimalist B-Sisters&#x2026;
</span>
</p>

<p>
Of course Emily&rsquo;s wish for nothing more than what she had of precious
Nature on Earth might have been a literary device, a poetising not
meant to be permanent and foundational. But somewhere she, too flawed,
too accustomed to Earth, should want anything of any Beyond but to
taste its awe as to substantiate its maker, is rising to the sublime
with modesty. If sister Charlotte&rsquo;s description of the Rivers family&rsquo;s
Moor House captures Nature as a subtlety-to-sublime realisation, Emily
makes a creed of expecting no more than the subtle awaking the
sublime. Yearning, striving, then facets of awe in a state of complete
reverence&#x2014;all while imbibing Dark and wrestling with Doom&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
&#x2026;and so with just these three poems meant to stay hidden in a
drawer, my Haworth Emily cut down legions of philosophers and cleared
mountains of theorising. The leitmotiv Dark running throughout offers
(to me at least) a complete and solid meal plan&#x2014;albeit plain and
simple, if not difficult to chew. Now I must ask, Can we get anywhere
in these fraught times loaded up with these penultimate Brontëan
memes? Any attempt to live out this heady Doom and Dark, this English
nature worship, would seem a hard row to hoe for us poor wretches
trying to negotiate today&rsquo;s modern miasma. And yet for me, being such
a bedraggled, beleaguered, <i>doomed</i> underdog, would seem to be the
perfect starting point, would it not?

One of my earliest encounters with what I might now categorise as
Dostoevski&rsquo;s <i>presence of eternal harmony</i> (POEH) came on a dark
Halloween evening back when I was a little boy of six years in my
small Southern Illinois town. We were trick-or-treating on my street,
the oldest in town with its cobblestone, gas streetlights, and
Victorian houses, and at some point I knew I had entered another
place, another time. Being so young meant I was not completely
disabused of the extra-normal; thus, other worlds, other dimensions
did not seem out of the ordinary. I remember looking up into the
dense, bare branches of the giant trees to see the moon beaming
through the crossing clouds and feeling like I was a part of some
special magical world. Throughout my life I&rsquo;ve compared subsequent
POEH experiences with that Halloween night. Perhaps this is why I
cleave to the Dark Muse. Allow me to insert an appropriate Haworth
Emily here
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
O dream, where art thou now?<br>
Long years have passed away<br>
Since cast from off thine angel brow<br>
I saw the light decay &#x2014;<br>
<br>
Alas! alas for me!<br>
Thou wert so bright and fair,<br>
I could not think thy memory<br>
Would yield me nought but care!<br>
<br>
The moonbeam and the storm,<br>
The summer eve divine,<br>
The silent night of solemn calm,<br>
The full moon&rsquo;s cloudless shine<br>
<br>
Were once entwined with thee,<br>
But now with weary pain &#x2014;<br>
Lost vision! &rsquo;tis enough for me &#x2014;<br>
Thou canst not shine again &#x2014;<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Yes, where has my childhood &ldquo;dream&rdquo; so opposite the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world taken
me? I live in a world, a time that would have me deny, forget, repress
such childhood magic, if for no other reason than they bring &ldquo;nought
but care.&rdquo; Nevertheless, I know my &ldquo;lost vision&rdquo; can only be found in
ersatz.
</p>

<p>
Scoffers will scoff, and no doubt what I just shared will easily be
dismissed as the imaginings of an impressionable small child; but as
a character in one of my stories says, &ldquo;Magic, it&rsquo;s just in your
head&#x2014;until it&rsquo;s not anymore.&rdquo; Many of us can feel the lack of
dichotomy between in and out of head.
</p>

<p>
Truly, I&rsquo;ve tried to be the atheist rationalist science type, but my
heart was never really in it. Throughout my &ldquo;career&rdquo; I wore a physics,
a math, and finally a computer hat. And although STEM paid the bills,
in the long run the whole sci-tech scene just never felt like
home. Science people can be the nicest people you&rsquo;d ever want to meet,
but at the end of the day they just weren&rsquo;t my crowd. Now I&rsquo;m back to
believing things I did when I was six, and still seeking my
people. Often enough I simply create my crowd in fictional short
stories and novels.
</p>

<p>
How did my dark inclinations continue? Whether you saw all the
Hollywood horror films or not, <i>everyone</i> of my generation knows the
television shows <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Addams_Family">The Addams Family</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Munsters">The Munsters</a></i>. Odd and
out-of-the-blue those series were, we all seemed to &ldquo;get&rdquo; the premise
and laugh along with the recurring goths-versus-normies gag. Likewise, the
biggest film of my childhood, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wizard_of_Oz">The Wizard of Oz</a></i> had many gothic
themes, especially the Wicked Witch of the West, her very creepy
flying monkeys and castle.<label id='fnr.152' for='fnr-in.152.8620572' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>152</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.152.8620572' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>152</sup>

<p>
My teen years were influenced mainly by the progressive Woodstock Era
memes, especially the music of the day, the only Dark exposure coming
from my paternal grandmother, who channelled a very Victorian
Englishness, inherited as we understood from her model Victorian
mother. She exuded a proto-Downton Abbey aura, something none of us in
that small Southern Illinois small town could fathom, that is, until
we finally saw Maggie Smith&rsquo;s Violet Crawley, the Dowager Countess of
Grantham!

<p>
My Grandma Grace Virginia did not possess great intellect or culture,
and yet she was a potent carrier of the even then quickly-fading
Victorian mega-paradigm. Specifically, she exposed us grandchildren to
its poets, especially Poe. She could recite <i>Annabel Lee</i> by heart. I
say she was not an educated thinker; nevertheless, she possessed an
instinctual grasp of the Dark Muse as if it were a common thread of
hers and the earlier Victorian generations. Longfellow, the Brownings,
and Whittier were also her favourites, and I can only assume she had
been infected by her mother who was born circa 1870. To be sure, we
are woven from strands reaching back into the past.

<p>
I joined the U.S. Army right out of high school in 1974, and in 1975,
at the age of nineteen, after basic training and AIT (Advanced
Individual Training), I received my permanent assignment to West
Germany. My first location was far out on the Bohemian frontier, deep
in the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavarian_Forest">Bavarian Forest</a></i> where the Army and Air Force operated a small
mountaintop electronic eavesdropping post near the tiny village of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rimbach,_Upper_Palatinate">Rimbach</a>.<label id='fnr.153' for='fnr-in.153.6810269' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>153</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.153.6810269' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>153</sup>
Depiction of Rimbach some six hundred years prior. Note the
red star just below the castle, my digs. <br>
<img src="images/lichteneck_ap2.jpg" alt="lichteneck_ap2.jpg"> <br>
<br>
</span> We were less than one hundred Americans &ldquo;on the
economy,&rdquo; which meant we had no base nor barracks, rather, lived out
amongst the locals. My rooms were with a farmer family in a house just
below the <i>haunted</i> Lichteneck <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burg_Lichteneck_(Oberpfalz)">castle ruins</a> overlooking the wild,
forested <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoher_Bogen">Hoher Bogen</a></i> ridge.
</p>

<p>
For the first time in my life I was living in, not just hearing or
reading about the Old World. I&rsquo;ll never forget waking up that first
September morning in Rimbach in the small, country-style <i>Pension</i> the
Army had rented for transient barracks and social events. It was
located in the centre of the tiny village, and my window that morning
overlooked the inner courtyard of a neighboring farm where I saw a
wizened old crone out of a fairytale splitting firewood. I then looked
up to the facing hillside and saw a small troop of men wearing what
looked like other-century traditional costumes hand-scything hay and
piling it into a horse-drawn wagon. It was truly the land time had
forgotten.
</p>

<p>
For the first time in my life I was not plugged into the all-consuming
American social-psychology spew and its blighting, domineering,
Zeitgeist-wrangling media. Everything around me felt old, <i>very</i> old,
the local Bavarians connected to something else, perhaps a fairytale
that was now in suspended animation.<label id='fnr.154' for='fnr-in.154.5725652' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>154</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.154.5725652' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>154</sup>
&#x2026;but aren&rsquo;t all fairy tales in suspended animation &ldquo;until
further notice,&rdquo; e.g., Merlin supposedly biding his time in some pit
or inside a hawthorn tree?
</span> And when I was handed a
copy of <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and I first learned of Hobbits and the
Shire, yes, I thought, this is the Shire! As Fall turned into Winter I
spent every free moment hiking the forested ridge trails. It was as if
time had changed its mechanisms from round, perfect cogs to endlessly
looping Möbius strips. I would work a shift at the high-tech American
site built on the <i>Hoher Bogen</i>&rsquo;s most eastern bump, <i>Eckstein</i>, then
reenter the fairytale land all around me. Oh but Nature had a very
dark, old, and serious feel in those environs, while by comparison any
American wilds had a lighter, even merry feel. I almost made it a
daily pilgrimage hiking up to the Lichteneck Ruins, parts of which had
been reconstructed, including the original keep. A legend said a
princess had thrown herself from the original keep to her death, and
her ghost supposedly roamed the place after dark. And so the warning
to never be in the woods after dark was taken seriously.

I can remember the odd dark, gothic moments during my Army time in
Germany. Back then, however, I was not keying on Dark, my life simple
experiential.

<p>
Fast forward several decades&#x2014;past my well-lit, rationalist life in
high-tech professions&#x2014;to find me in the far northeastern corner of
Minnesota, the so-called <i>North Shore</i> of Lake Superior. This is the
very last county, Cook, just before the Canadian border, the very tip
of the so-called &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrowhead_Region">Arrowhead Region</a>&rdquo; to the north and east of
Duluth. Here are some six million-plus acres of wilderness continuing
northward from the coast of the world&rsquo;s largest body of freshwater (by
surface area). To be sure, this can be a very Dark Muse kind of place,
so much so that believe I cannot go, cannot go &#x2026; as much as my
fellow humans here frustrate me with their obstinance and pointedly
anti-Dark attitudes. Pictures may be worth thousands of words, but our
Dark vibe up here must be experienced to be truly appreciated. I
routinely get tiny glimpses of the shadow and magic realm whenever I
look out at my moonlit <i>Inland Sea</i><label id='fnr.155' for='fnr-in.155.9358773' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>155</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.155.9358773' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>155</sup>
Really though, calling her <i>Lake</i> Superior is like calling
Einstein a high school graduate.
</span> over the treetops of dark
spruce and gnarled, bare aspen. As Haworth Emily has taught me, Nature is the
original Dark.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Inland Sea</i> or <i>Mother Superior</i>, as some call her, is so
much more sea-like than any lake. To my thinking, a lake is much
smaller and much&#x2014;plainer, simpler. The enormity of our Inland Sea
means she is often violent like any sea or ocean of saltwater. No
friendly little puddle for beer-and-brats picnickers, speedboat and
jet ski riffraff is she.<label id='fnr.156' for='fnr-in.156.6490132' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>156</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.156.6490132' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>156</sup>
Wetsuits de rigueur. Even in summer a dunk in her longer than
ten minutes can lead to hypothermia &#x2026; at least on the North
Coast. Although the south beaches of Wisconsin and Michigan can be
swimmable in the height of summer. However, global climate change may
be altering this. Alas.
</span> To be sure, one senses a mighty
présence on her shores, often dark and moody, if not angry and
malevolent on a stormy night. The lady has her <i>moods</i>.
</p>

<p>
Despite our expansive and all but contiguous wildness, despite our
famous chains of Ice Age-glaciated lakes in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_Waters_Canoe_Area_Wilderness">Boundary Waters Canoe
Area Wilderness</a>, the Arrowhead is not <i>spectacular</i> in the
stereotypical &ldquo;American Great Outdoors&rdquo; sense. Nothing here overwhelms
as with the American West or Alaska with their &ldquo;natural wonders&rdquo;
postcard vistas every five feet. As I&rsquo;m saying, a deep moodiness often
prevails, setting up the Dark Muse subtle to sublime pathway. But as
I&rsquo;m saying, my local community is bereft of Dark Musers.<label id='fnr.157' for='fnr-in.157.2986018' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>157</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.157.2986018' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>157</sup>
&#x2026;or if they&rsquo;re here they&rsquo;re hiding very well.
</span> Which
might have a silver lining in that I have a perfect laboratory to test
whether the Dark Muse is nature or nurture. That is to say, if I see
no past-century architecture,<label id='fnr.158' for='fnr-in.158.1974098' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>158</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.158.1974098' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>158</sup>
Our little cemetery looks nothing like the Cimetière du
Père-Lachaise, Paris, France <br>
<img src="images/Pere_Lachaise_Chemin_Errazu.jpg" alt="Pere_Lachaise_Chemin_Errazu.jpg"> <br>
<br>
</span> if I have no like-minded
community to mutually re-enforce nighttime proclivities, then any Dark
musing must come from the actual place itself, hence, nature over
nurture, right?
</p>

<p>
Yes I do believe I am here quite alone with my Dark musings. Despite
Grand Marais counting only some thirteen hundred permanent residents,
we are becoming evermore modern urban/suburban in behavior and
mentality. Why? Mainly due to our popularity as a Northern Midwest
resort town. Tourists of short-, medium-, and long-stay duration,
well-off retirees, and especially all the relocating urban-suburban
refugees constantly mix up and dilute this community. And these
newcomers are surely tipping the balance away from any sort of small-town
ambience; instead, they bring and maintain their aloof, disengaged,
blinkered, emotionally and intellectually unavailable urban-suburban
ways. Of course &ldquo;boosters,&rdquo; the knee-jerk positive promoters and spin
doctors, will always disagree with my assessment; but many
&ldquo;old-timers&rdquo; agree that it ain&rsquo;t what it used to be. Alas.
</p>

<p>
A particular North Shore social-psychological phenomenon is the large
numbers of people who relocate here from the Midwestern urban
city-states, e.g., Chicago or especially the Twin Cities, ostensibly
to <i>reinvent</i> themselves. Of course tourist destinations traffic in
short-exposure vibe and fantasy, but here is a very unique sort of
expectancy build-up. My theory has it that our newcomers are making
their one great leap out of the sterile, soulless clone-bunny
urban/suburban scene with the intent of becoming some better, more
<i>authentic</i> version of themselves in the wilderness. The most dominant
North Shore reinvention <i>lifestyle-statement</i> is loosely based around
a Hemingway and Jack London ethos, i.e., the macho, gonzo, adventurer
takes on the Great Outdoors, something I call <i>Neo-Klondikism</i>. Of
course the real white European North Shore pioneers of the
late-nineteenth, early-twentieth centuries were mainly of Scandinavian
origin and brought their admixture of Scandi and Victorian
civilization to the wilderness; but none of that remains, except at
the Historical Society&rsquo;s museum. Today we see <i>Outside</i> magazine
acteurs, college-grad back-to-the-lander nouveau hillbilly peasant
chic, with their tattoos, huge beards, Carhartt and Pendelton duds,
driving Jeep Cherokees, their Americana faux country-western
Appalachian theme music&#x2014;in other words, an impromptu guerrilla
theatre of the American Zeitgeist churn.
</p>

<p>
But then what are we supposed to be doing up here? Thousands upon
thousands of tourists spend their vacation time and money here. If I&rsquo;m
getting Dark vibes, I won&rsquo;t pretend to know what they are getting out
of this place.<label id='fnr.159' for='fnr-in.159.1640184' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>159</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.159.1640184' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>159</sup>
&#x2026;though they do seem to &ldquo;stay connected&rdquo; <br>
<img src="images/NewYorkerCover03-02-2015.png" alt="NewYorkerCover03-02-2015.png"> <br>
<br>
</span> Many decide to be here permanently, thus, begin
their North Shore lives of expectation&#x2014;that their childhood memories
of singing Kumbaya around the campfire and the general vacation magic
become 24/7.

Grand Marais is the home of the <a href="https://northhouse.org/">North House Folk School</a>, where the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_and_Crafts_movement">Arts and Crafts Movement</a> meets the Scandinavian <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_high_school">Folk school</a></i>. On the
summer solstice they hold their annual <a href="https://www.northhouse.org/events/wooden-boat-show?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwhb60BhClARIsABGGtw85B1_ja5XEfwK8z67xLIluZlvh8rzvshmO0ke1XdO84iJQRGChyCsaAqqfEALw_wcB">Wooden Boat Show</a> where
non-powered, legacy wooden boats&#x2014;many built on-site&#x2014;are on
display, subsequently sailed and oared about our Grand Marais
harbour. To be sure, many of these designs are based on the crafts
used by the Norwegian immigrant fishermen of the late nineteenth,
early-twentieth century along our Lake Superior coast. But during this
summer&rsquo;s event all the happy boating was disrupted when a hooligan on
a &ldquo;personal watercraft,&rdquo; aka jet ski, ripped around the harbour,
throwing wake after wake at the floating participants. I&rsquo;ve thought
about this quite a bit, about how these visiting &ldquo;educated elites&rdquo;
from the Twin Cities were mocked by the yokel descendent of
Scandinavian peasant loggers and fishermen. And so in the twenty-first
century we have one derivative <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperreality">hyperreality</a></i> attacking
another. Wikipedia defines hyperreality thusly
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hyperreality is a concept that refers to the process of the
evolution of notions of reality, leading to a cultural state of
confusion between signs and symbols invented to stand in for reality,
and direct perceptions of consensus reality &#x2026; Hyperreality tricks
consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement,
instead opting for artificial simulation, and endless reproductions of
fundamentally empty appearance&#x2026; *Fulfillment or happiness is found
through simulation and imitation of a transient simulacrum (an
insubstantial, unsatisfactory imitation) of reality, rather than any
interaction with any &ldquo;real&rdquo; reality.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A working definition of hyperreality has often simply been &ldquo;porn.&rdquo; And
so I wonder what are these idealist, progressive college-gradders
hoping to experience with their brief proximity to traditional,
human-powered boats? But then what would the hooligan from his world
of NASCAR, &ldquo;contemporary&rdquo; country music, and cheap American beer hope
to achieve with his little protest action? Are we all just lost in
these endless opaque labyrinths of recursive symbols, stand-ins, and
derivative hyperreality? What is porn and what is real? Yes, indeed,
this is the North Shore resort town theatre I experience daily.
</p>

<p>
Dare I say outright nobody gets this place&#x2014;or that I do and they
don&rsquo;t? And yet there is a tacit understanding that here is not really
dazzling striking amazing. This is a lower-key for sure. Wealthy
people are here; but this is certainly not the ostentatious, celebrity
scene like Jackson Hole, Wyoming, nor dynastic &ldquo;old money&rdquo; like
Newport, Rhode Island. No, we&rsquo;re not in that league.<label id='fnr.160' for='fnr-in.160.1952839' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>160</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.160.1952839' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>160</sup>
The Great Lakes tourist scene has always been a grittier,
more working-class world than other tourist Meccas.
</span> A
memorable advertisement poster for Arrowhead tourism showed a twilit
Boundary Waters wilderness lake with the tagline &ldquo;Stirred not
shaken.&rdquo;<label id='fnr.161' for='fnr-in.161.1181245' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>161</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.161.1181245' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>161</sup>
A flip of the James Bond martini quip?
</span> I&rsquo;m sure some have their Dark Muse moments, but
simply lack the cultural background to process (embellish?) and
identify them as such. For example, our so-called Northern Lights give
pause, are beloved by all, thus, Night gets a probational
capitalisation

<p>
Here&rsquo;s a few lines I once wrote some twenty years ago after a
late-autumn hike
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Mists race westward through the surrounding spruce forest, enveloping
the entire ridge. The light is quickly failing, the Western
Hemisphere’s greatest inland sea just four miles south and seven
hundred feet below fully obscured. Sleet begins to fall stinging my
face, keeping my eyes from fully focusing. Though I hear the wind
through the coated trees, the distant sound of the invisible waves
crashing angrily against the rocks, land&rsquo;s staunch defenders.
</p>

<p>
I have come the four miles up from the town, up the wet, slippery
trail, up through the darkening forest, to pay homage to this late
autumn wonderland. I, modern human, wear a Gore-Tex jacket over a
Merino wool top over a silk base layer. I wear running tights and
padded biking gloves. I wear special minimalist running shoes to
simulate barefoot running. So dressed I am out to face the age-old
elements.
</p>

<p>
Not a soul as I climb the darkening trail. I pause at the ridge’s two
main streams to take in their loud and clear coursing from all the new
precipitation. I should walk rather than run. But visibility is going
fast and I must reach the ridge top ere dusk.
</p>

<p>
Fittingly anti-climatic is my arrival at the cloud-bound ridge
top. All but evening&rsquo;s darkness when I set off again for home. The
snow is now accumulating in earnest, making downhill footing
difficult. But the Muse is strong, and the growing twilight and
pooling blackness make it all the stronger.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Throughout my wonderful hikes in these wild, dark places I greatly
appreciate the natural beauty. But always lingering are existential
doubts, mainly in the form of my undeniable separation from nature,
again, that huge modern gradient between indoors and outdoors, that
constant calling of our divorced partner. If I said <i>our growing
separation from nature runs parallel to our growing separation from
one another</i>, I wouldn&rsquo;t be saying much new. People today are waddling
about in their <i>fantasy silos</i> being extremely sensitive to any
challenges of their illusions, their hyperreality stack. I sense we&rsquo;re
in the midst of a great unmooring, and I feel a growing dysphoria. It
was darkening round me on that magical Halloween evening so many
decades ago, as well as on that misty, sleeting evening here.
</p>

<p>
As so often before and since, I finished my lonely, silent, inclement
ridge-top visitation and left Nature to return to my cocooned human
existence. So there I sat in my modern, space station-like apartment
drinking my protein shake and wondering what it all meant. Those
particular lines were written before I had really latched onto the
Dark Muse. Now things are much more firmly formed and I&rsquo;m following a
more intentional path vis-à-vis Dark. And yet clarity, direction,
purpose are a fleeting as ever&#x2014;though what is Dark to me is
interwoven with what is Nature to me. Maybe I should just try for more
mysticism as did my nineteenth-century principals. Here again is
Haworth Emily
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I’m happiest when most away<br>
I can bear my soul from its home of clay<br>
On a windy night when the moon is bright<br>
And the eye can wander through worlds of light &#x2014;<br>
When I am not and none beside &#x2014;<br>
Nor earth nor sea nor cloudless sky &#x2014;<br>
But only spirit wandering wide<br>
Through infinite immensity.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
And here&rsquo;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Byron">Byron</a><label id='fnr.162' for='fnr-in.162.7368631' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>162</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.162.7368631' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>162</sup>
&#x2026;mad, bad, and dangerous to know Lord Byron from his
<i>Childe Harold&rsquo;s Pilgrimage</i>.
</span>
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
I live not in myself, but I become<br>
Portion of that around me; and to me<br>
High mountains are a feeling, but the hum<br>
Of human cities torture: I can see<br>
Nothing to loathe in nature, save to be<br>
A link reluctant in a fleshy chain,<br>
Class’d among creatures, when the soul can flee,<br>
And with the sky, the peak, the heaving plain<br>
Of ocean, or the stars, mingle, and not in vain.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
When I&rsquo;m in Nature I can feel <i>something</i>&#x2014;even realising I&rsquo;m a
barely-tolerated out to despised orphan prodigal juggling my own
illusions and hyperrealities. But invariably when I return to
civilisation I always feel somewhat crash-landed. If the Marine drill
sergeant said to the recruit struggling to do push-ups, <i>pain is
weakness leaving the body,</i> then <i>depression is illusion leaving the
mind</i>. I would blame myself even louder if not for the fact that so
many, many people can relate to this pervasive emptiness. Longing,
yearning might be all I can ever do amidst infirmities, weakness,
corruption, depression &#x2026; once more Haworth Emily
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
&#x2026;&rsquo;Twas grief enough to think mankind<br>
All hollow, servile, insincere &#x2014;<br>
But worse to trust to my own mind<br>
And find the same corruption there<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
In closing, I doubt Grand Marais will ever be my sepulchre by the
sea. I may eventually move on to where the cemeteries are bigger, the
buildings older, the people more openly darkly-inclined. Or just find,
wherever they may be, a niche amongst those who acknowledge there can
be a darkness in the day and a lightness arriving at twilight.<label id='fnr.163' for='fnr-in.163.6058889' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>163</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.163.6058889' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>163</sup>
<i>&#x2026;But could the day seem dark to me because the night was
fair?</i> asked Haworth Emily.
</span>
But here is so much of Nature if I will keep after her. And in so
chasing Nature, I in my own modern-era way embrace the &ldquo;dark half&rdquo; as
well, deterioration and Death. Brightness, darkness. The sun
shines. The clouds hide the sun. The moon shines. The clouds hide the
moon. Light and its play pull at me. The seasons turn eternally,
emphasizing cycles over clocks&#x2014;that too. Lost and found and lost
again is a basic cycle as well. But at the end of the day my Dark Muse
remains mouldering, smoldering, waiting, waiting for something. But
for now at least I cannot go, I cannot go.
