* 6th of April, 2022

This has been a typical North Coast (NC) early Spring week (March
20---26) of weather confusion. It was sunny and relatively mild,
hovering around 40 over the weekend, but then Tuesday the 22nd through
Wednesday the 23rd brought at least a foot of heavy, wet snow. Today,
we have again a mild and sunny day, last check 49 degrees! But again,
this is typical NC bait-and-switch, i.e., we can go right back to
/Half-Winter/, my term for the typical Spring up here where we bounce
between daily freezing temps up to the fifties.

I try to get down to the Harbour daily. Yesterday this was the East
Bay

so it escapes the scientific scalpels and tweezers
of scholarly research. Basically, one reads...and one
absorbs---perhaps many times this cycle. And then the exercise part of
the process is over. No further left-brain analysis or dissection
necessary. No "what does it really mean?" No "what was the context in
which..." No "what were his sources of inspiration." Let's take a look
at a poem from whom I consider one of the leading poets of the age,
she being Emily Jane Brontë, specifically, her /Fall leaves fall/

#+begin_verse
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse

This is your first test. You either get it or you don't. No digging or
working out its meaning necessary.

** Brontë versus Hemingway



** Three shelves

** Sublimity

The /sublime/ is a particularly badly mauled concept by the academes.
