* WUTHERING faq/interview/manifesto

Allow me to repeat my statement

#+begin_quote
This site will explore the mysterious allure of the Inland Sea, which
may lie close to what some of the poets of the nineteenth century, the
/Romanticists/, were on about.
#+end_quote

and explain what I mean...

** Why have you renamed Lake Superior to /The Inland Sea/?

Simply put, it's too big and grand and epic and sublime a body of
water to just be a lake.  For me a lake is something that can be
looked across, from one shore to the far shore. Or maybe at only a few
widest places can I not see to the other side.

Really now, do you think the world's largest body of fresh water
surface-wise (31,700 square miles)---bigger than lots of bodies called
seas, for example, the Aral Sea, the Dead Sea, the Salton Sea---is
just a lake? I don't. I think it's definitely a /sea/. We have a sea
the same way we have the boreal /forest/, not the boreal thicket or
copse or grove or even woods. The Ojibwa name /gichi-gami/ means
"great sea."  The French explorers came up with the name /le lac
supérieur/ meaning the "upper lake" above Lake Huron. This was then
anglicised to Lake Superior. A comedy of geographic-cartographic
errors, I'd say.

Perhaps /Inland Sea/ is vague; there are other bodies of water around
the world referred to as such. As a book title, James Fenimore Cooper
called Lake Ontario the Inland Sea. And with /Operation Inland
Seas/ the U.S. Navy referred to all of the Great Lakes as the inland
seas when, upon its completion in 1959, they sent a flotilla up the
St. Lawrence Seaway. But vague is good. It means we're being local and
/vernacular/, /provincial/, if not /parochial/ about our sea. Let them
deal with us.

One ulterior motive is to raise a sense of majesty and mystery in a
poetic sense. That's all, really. Saying Inland Sea or The Inland Sea
is a bit like saying /world/ or /globe/ instead of /planet/. It's
evocative. It engenders allure. Inland Sea then begs renaming /North
Shore/ to /North Coast/.

** What do you mean by /wuthering/?

One main difference between indoors and outdoors is that outdoors
typically has a naturally-occurring breeze or *wind*. And if we have
wind as strong as it can be up here on the North Coast of the Inland
Sea, then we have /wuthering/.[fn:1] @@html:<label for="mn-demo"

Emily Jane Brontë @@html:</span>@@ Though it is ironic that my
favourite poet, *Emily Jane Brontë*, wrote the novel /*Wuthering*
Heights/, which I have not read. My former wife read it and did not
care for it, and I've always taken her opinion as final.

** Why would you connect this place with Romanticism?

To be sure, insisting this unique place of sea and land is something
other than how the prevailing image influencers and tourist brochures
are painting it will certainly ruffle some feathers. I presuppose

a) I know what Romanticism is, and,
b) image, symbols, narrative, mythology are fungible.

Let me address number two first. To my mind this landscape of
wilderness and water is distinctive to the point of defying
description, definition, any sort of label. Occupied permanently only
/post/-Columbian by the Ojibwa people, they soon after joined by
French traders, finally settled by mainly Scandinavian immigrants, the
North Coast has not seen permanent human habitation for long enough to
settle on any narrative or mythology. But since the 1970s when my
Boomer generation, arriving from urban/suburban places like the Twin
Cities and Chicago, began to outnumber the Scandi locals, as well as
the steady replacement of mining and timber industries with tourism,
there's been something of a consensus around the idea that we are a
/lost, discontiguous county of Alaska/. This is what I call
*Neo-Klondikism*.

#+end_export

The Neo-Klondike Movement is a backwoods northern frontier
anti-aesthetic where protagonists of all possible genders wear flannel
shirts, woolen pants with a sheathed knife on a leather belt,
hobnail-derivative boots---exchanged for Steger mukluks in the
winter. The official narrators are Jack London and Robert
Service---with non-boreal Ernest Hemingway as an honorary
bard[fn:2]. Our official TV shows are /Northern Exposure/ and
especially /The Red Green Show/. Our official music is anything
twangy, banjos never enough of them.

And yet Neo-Klondike is completely divorced from anything Ojibwa,
French, or Scandinavian. Neo-Klondike is especially perpendicular from
Scandinavia, a place with a long tradition of just this sort of humans
embedded deep in boreal forest mythology. Granted, if you peruse the
children's books at the Duluth Public Library you will find a full
selection of Germanic-Scandinavian narrative myth picture books from
Elsa Beskow, Astrid Lundgren, Sibylle von Olfers, Selma Lagerlöf, Hans
Christian Andersen, and John Bauer, supported by Germanic-British
narrative mythology from Tolkien, Arthur Rackam, to name just a
few. And yes, we have the /North House Folk School/, a supposed
cultural vestige from Scandinavia. But you won't hear Swedish folk
bands Väsen or Garmarna or cow-calling (/kulning/) or hardanger fiddle
at any of the Folk School's major musical events, usually just twangy
stuff.

#+end_export

No, for anything Scandi-myth, for any sort of Lindgren's /Bullerby/
you'll find only the faintest echoes on today's North Coast.

** Neo-Klondike needs competition from another reimagining, rebranding?

There seems to be two general relocators to the North Coast---well-off
retirees who see this as a quiet, picturesque place for their dessert
years, and those people wanting to get away from somewhere less
desirable and restart their lives. With this second group
*authenticity* is a big motivator. Like so many of us, we came from
sterile, conformist, cookie-cutter urban-suburban landscapes devoid of
nature, flogging an exclusive narrative of materialism. We grew up as
part of the nameless, faceless grey modern masses, and as young adults
we set out searching for something, somewhere real and authentic. And
so we made this big jump out of the middle-, upper-middle-class to be
here[fn:3].

My pegging of Neo-Klondike was meant to be amusing, and what I mean
/WUTHERING/ to be will probably /not/ appeal to a Neo-Klondiker. If
you're a Neo-Klondiker you've found your haven, your hermitage. You've
gone through your rebirth/rebranding, this near-Alaska lifestyle being
a perfect 180-degrees away from your suburban clone-bunny past. Even
though I grew up in suburban America, I can't do Neo-Klondike. All I
want WUTHERING to be is a second opinion, not a competitor.

** So if you're not with the program why did you come here in the first place---why did you stay?

In 2003, I, my wife Kristine at the time, and our twin boys, came up
to the North Coast from Kristine's home in Kansas. Typical, we were
looking for an anti-bourgeois, back-to-the-land life. We had been big
earners in the Matrix, I programming, she management. But as we
settled in and time marched on we realised we were not really meant
for this endless episode of /The Red Green Show/ after all. For
example, Kristine had a complete edition of Jane Austen, a big door
stop of a book, which she read every night before bed. She would read
it cover-to-cover, then start over again. But even more divergent, she
was Mennonite, a curious Protestant sect with similar
social-psychology to the Mormons, that is, insular, self-contained,
not really looking for alternative lifestyles. Her head really wasn't
in it.

And so as the years played out and our boys grew up[fn:4] I had many
moments of "oh fecal matter" when I realised that I was just not
vibrating on this predominant quasi-hillbilly with Hemingway sprinkles
wavelength. At some point we reached full disillusionment mode, and
yet we were stuck, having abandoned our yuppie careers and no real
interest in making some career in the tourist-based Neo-Klondike
economy. Finally, Kristine decided to become a Mennonite pastor, and
so in 2014 we relocated to the Mennonite heartland of Northern
Indiana. There our marriage hit the rocks, such an iconoclast as I
never a good match for her Mennonite world, let alone as a Mennonite
pastor's spouse.

But one shared thing was our love of English and German culture,
especially that of the eighteenth and nineteenth century. It was our
escapism from North Coast escapism.

** Really though, how is some 19th-century Romanticism template overlay better than Neo-Klondike?

A very simple and direct (if not shocking) answer is because I, and
you probably, are of Northwestern European descent[fn:5], and what
many of the poets thrown together under the rubric /Romanticsim/ were
going after was a nature-based spirituality specifically for us
Europeans, one that, strangely enough, would combine three poles

1. dark, mysterious, gothy[fn:6] things;
2. pagan bits and pieces;
3. a more "poetic" take on Christianity

---all of it embedded in *Nature* (capitalised). I feel in my
/folk-soul/, in my genetic memory---as tribal, identitarian, and
unpolitically correct as that may seem---the briefest glimpses of
something /beyond/, something /sublime/[fn:7] when I read my Romantic
Era poets.

Story: During my misspent youth (which, by the way, just wrapped up a
few weeks ago), I once tried to join a back-to-the-land/nature commune
in Wisconsin where everyone was white like me but pretending to be
Native American. I'd always been a great admirer of the Native
American nature-based belief system and initially thought this was
very cool. But at some point it became obvious that, no, I was
witnessing a bone-headed example of /cultural
appropriation/. Something a Dakota man at the Pine Ridge Reservation
once said to me came back, "You're like stray dogs hanging around the
village." He meant whites trying to be native. Obviously, he wasn't
buying into "we're all just mix-and-match."

I had explored proto-European spiritual movements; but so many seemed
just too kooky, if not tainted with fascism, out to completely
over-the-top Nazism. Keeping the hippie Odinists separate from the
far-Right skinhead Odinists was just too problematic.

Back in the Army circa 1975 I was stationed in Germany deep in the
Bavarian-Bohemian Forest. There I read /Lord of the Rings/, which
resonated in that near-authentic Bavarian Shire very powerfully. I
lived with a local family just below a haunted castle ruins. My
landlady believed in ghosts and witches, and her son-in-law swore he
and his brother had once found dwarf tunnels. That whole "roots"
episode stuck.[fn:8]

At some point I started reading the poetry of *Emily Brontë*, then
others of her era. At some point it began to sink in that the
late-eighteenth-, early-nineteenth-century poets of
Romanticism---mainly English and German--- were /finally/ getting
around to something real, reaching into that nexus of Nature
dreaming us and we Nature[fn:9].

So instead of chasing after gurus and shaman and wise-men/women from
different cultures and races, why don't we find our own?

** Are you saying Neo-Klondike is bogus?

Let's first back /way/ up to answer this, to trace Neo-Klondike's
roots. Literature---or should I say it's gatekeepers---abandoned
ephemeral, intractable Romanticism---early. Even in Edgar Allan Poe's
times, publishers were "through" with Romanticism/Dark
Romanticism. But then Poe would sneak around them and manage to get
his blockbuster poems or short stories published. /The Raven/ went
viral---especially in Europe[fn:10]. As did /Annabel Lee/ and many of
this gothic stories. Throughout especially the later half of
the Nineteenth, the gatekeepers were eager to move on to what became
known as /modern realism/. Henrik Ibsen was one of their initial
champions. For example, his play /An Enemy of the People/ offered
exactly what realism advocates wanted, i.e., a real assessment of
society, especially stories uncovering our ills, mistakes, cover-ups,
/hypocrisies/.

However, this exposé era of mod-real was short, as Ibsen himself
shifted all at once from truth-seeking critiques such as /A Doll's
House/ to the more nihilistic /Hedda Gabler/. In Hedda, the characters
are /not/ truth-seeking wrong-righters like the doctor in /An
Enemy.../, rather, just a pack of over-socialised bourgeois salon
lions ripping each other apart---for no better motives than boredom
and dark Freudianisms as one critic noted. And so modern realism
descended ... into nihilist existential meaninglessness, into denial
of right and wrong, into God-scoffing, away from old souls out in
Nature and into new souls indoors. Such Romantic Era sentiments as

#+begin_quote
Mellan Guds skapelse och Kristi medkänsla kommer du att finna din
lycka. \\
Between God’s creation and Christ’s compassion you will find your bliss.
#+end_quote

were suddenly déclassé puerile sentimentality.

Henry James was probably the most prominent "preferred" author of this
/fin de siècle/ era---Tennyson, Ruskin, Morris, Palmer, and
Pre-Raphaelite Neo-Romantic throw-backs be damned. James once came up
to Louisa May Alcott at an award ceremony for her /Little Women/ and
said to her point-blank, "You know, you're not a good writer." Er,
other way around, from my perspective.



** I took a classic English lit class once. I don't remember any "European nature spirituality."

That's because your "classic English lit class" was no doubt taught by
a clueless academe[fn:11] who himself only repeated the standard
recycled clichés about Romanticism[fn:12]. I finally realised something
very important about Romanticism, namely, that what the academes were
saying and what I was getting from just reading the poems and looking
at the art were two completely different animals. I've become very
particular about "additional information"---about the authors, about
their times and influences[fn:13]. I simply want to read and adsorb the
actual materials. Consider what John Keats' character in the 2009 film
/Bright Star/ says

#+begin_quote
A poem needs understanding through the senses. The point of diving in
a lake is not immediately to swim to the shore, but to be in the lake,
to luxuriate in the sensation of water. You do not "work the lake
out." It is an experience beyond thought. Poetry soothes and emboldens
the soul to accept mystery.

Right. The point is not to analyse to death each and every tree, but
to take in the deepest realisation possible of the forest as a
whole. Never before did poetry reach so far into the whole, into the
intuitive and unexplainable as in the nineteenth century in the era of
/Romanticism/[fn:14] in places like England and Germany. And yes, very
many academes just don't get Romanticism. They're the people who
immediately swim to shore.

** Very well, academes don't get it, but again, "European nature spirituality?"

One of the big motivators for me was all of the academe analyses of
Romanticism, Dark Romanticism, the Sublime, etc. /Somebody/ has to
counter their dull tedium!

WUTHERING will initially center on Emily Brontë, whom I shall call
/Haworth Emily/ henceforth[fn:15]. Here are some choice
lines from her /Shall Earth no more inspire thee?/, where she has
Earth beseeching the human to ... /come back and dwell with me/

#+begin_verse
...Thy mind is ever moving
In regions dark to thee;
Recall its useless roving---
Come back and dwell with me.

I know my mountain breezes
Enchant and soothe thee still---
I know my sunshine pleases
Despite thy wayward will.
...
Then let my winds caress thee;
Thy comrade let me be---
Since nought beside can bless thee,
Return and dwell with me.
#+end_verse

And so I say again, /just read the poems and let that suffice/. Take
them in. Give them time. Here's a WUTHERING litmus test, a short /Dark
Romantic/ poem from Haworth Emily called /Fall leaves fall/

#+begin_verse
Fall, leaves, fall; die, flowers, away;
Lengthen night and shorten day;
Every leaf speaks bliss to me
Fluttering from the autumn tree.
I shall smile when wreaths of snow
Blossom where the rose should grow;
I shall sing when night’s decay
Ushers in a drearier day.
#+end_verse








Yes, yes, the irony of introspective, contemplative nature-based
Wordsworthian-Brontëan poetry coming out of Britain's most
imperialistic, Manifest Destiny times is schizophrenic for
certain. And no, I don't think many "got it," much less could really
do much with it back then. And yet Romantic aesthetics has come
roaring back for me, stronger and more relevant than ever before.

Gottfried Keller Hans Magnus' lament. Lament in general throughout
Haworth Emily's poetry.






** 

Because I must. Keats lake.





** Aren't you just projecting your interpretation on Romanticism? Aren't you just idealising, /romanticising/ the life, the people back then?

I can say definitively they were a few shades more "real" than we
clone-bunny suburbanites are. Here's some dialogue from my not really
published book /Emily of Wolkeld/.[fn:16] In this scene Annette is visiting the
Whitmore's Wolkeld estate, the two girls walking the lane up to the
neglected manor house Wolkeld Hall, talking about /Jane Eyre/ and her
existence with the Rivers family as a school marm

#+begin_quote
“No, no, of course not.” Emily groaned and shook her hands in
frustration. “I know it sounds mad, but I want that life.”

“What life?”

“Why, Jane Eyre’s! At least the one she had with the Rivers family.”
Emily stopped and looked up into the oak limbs. “I know I didn’t
explain it very well, but that was the life, the church I was
imagining.”

Annette jumped a pace ahead, wheeled around, and, shaking her index
finger admonishingly, exclaimed, “Well, you can’t have it!”

Emily laughed brightly at her friend’s petulant theatrics.

“What?!” exclaimed Annette, joining in the laughter. “Is it my
accent?”

“No, Annette, no. It’s just how you said that.”	

Emily straightened up, took a breath, and began walking again. Annette
fell in beside her. “No, really, imagine being a school teacher back
then in that country parish. Earning a pittance. Living in a stone
cottage. All around is a Yorkshire semi-wilderness. And nowhere on the
planet is anything even vaguely modern, nothing that could save a
person from an infected—toe.”

“Harsh,” said Annette, “harsh, but I suppose thrilling for it. And it
was exactly that harshness, those real boundaries and limits that
elicited the beauty.”

“Would you go back if you could? If there were a time machine, would
you go back?”

The tall German threw her head back and forced her chest out. After a
big inhale-exhale, she said, “I’d go back. I would.”

“Even if it meant an earlier death?”

“Because I’m a baron’s daughter, and I would have a definite place.”

“And you don’t have a place here?”

Just then a wind burst caused a shower from the branches above. Emily
	glanced over at her friend, wondering if she had pushed too
	hard. Annette finally spoke: “My true self would be growing in
	proper soil. And my death . . . I would trust my death, came
	it early or late.”

“You would accept an early death?”

“Death cannot be rejected, so our acceptance of it is irrelevant. Our
lives, our deaths are in God’s hands.”
#+end_quote


So no, I'm not romanticising any part of it. Just the opposite. Life
in the first half of the nineteenth century was much harsher than
today's. But it was more real for it.

I look at today's fecklessness, our relatively facile lives and wonder
if a dose of harshness isn't what we need. I'm hardly original with
this idea. There are so many who have advocated harshness---in
carefully measured doses, that is. Which makes it really just posing,
theatre. Alas.

** Aren't you just adding to the culture/lifestyle wars? Why worry about themes and symbols so much?

Yes. Admitted. I'm not a native[fn:17]. As a relative newcomer I've
mostly thought I shouldn't oppose the existing cultural /Gestalt/ of
this area; but it always galled me that the dominant subculture, what
I call /Neo-Klondike/ misses entirely what I sense up here.



** Politics?

Left, Right? Preferably neither nor. To me, today's political world is
like a junkyard of toxic memes, a procession of good cop, bad cop
entrapment schemes one after the other. Since the vibe of the Inland
Sea is what I'm really trying to capture, today's topsy-turvy,
house-of-mirros politics doesn't really need me adding my two cents
very often.

But since this is a tell-all FAQ I will come out and say point-blank I
believe American Democracy is failing. If you must know I'm a
*Monarchist*. What? You can't be serious! How can you possibly be a
Monarchist? Either you're just being a kooky contrarian---or you've
been watching too much /Downton Abbey/.

It's taken me quite a while to become a Monarchist, but the seeds were
planted in my head while in Europe (seven years total; Germany,
Switzerland). To be sure, very many layers of scales fell from my eyes
while in Europe, one set being the issue of political systems. As some
wise and intelligent Germans enlightened me, there are really only two
political systems: Monarchism and Not-Monarchism. Not-Monarchism comes
in two flavours, namely, republican-representational systems commonly
referred to as democracies, and autocratic systems known as
dictatorships.

If there is one political belief we've all been taught from an early
age to accept unquestioningly, that would be democracy. But as was
pointed out to me, democracy really only works in the most optimal
settings and perfect conditions, i.e., societies that are relatively
peaceful and prosperous. In other words, only when the sun is shining
and the winds are calm does democracy seem to function---at all. And
so if we look at a map of the world, only those places in the very
well developed world have what we'd call functioning democracies,
everywhere else, dysfunctional democracies of various stripes, out to
dictatorships.

Why is democracy only for the rich and stable? Because it is
representational, and that means /everyone/---including all the "bad
sorts," all the people you don't like, don't get along with, all the
unintelligent and uninformed rubes---get to participate. A democratic
elections put one group in power while the others are left out. Part
and parcel of every democracy are factions and so-called "special
interests." But of course political groupings can be rather benign
when the sun is shining and the breezes are gentle.

Special interests, parties, factions, lobbyists scurrying to-and-fro,
this group in, that group out---none of it seems so bad when times are
good. But once any real problems or disagreements arise, these
divisions come out with a vengeance. And if things are really bad, the
power blocks grab their weapons and force their will upon society. One
gang is in power and their enemies, their opponents are liquidated. So
democracy and dictatorship are just two sides of the same coin. This
means no amount of vigilance or resolve can stop a dictator from
rising when the sun goes behind a cloud or the wind picks
up. Dictators simply come with the territory when the going gets
rough.

Seen in this light, we might lift ourselves above all of today's
tail-chasing and squabbling and see it all as just a transition period
from the one form of Not-monarchism to the other.

** ...so what is monarchism?

Let's start by saying the vast majority of Americans have no idea of
what monarchism really is, havig been fed all their lives a steady
diet of misinformation and Hollywood sensationalism. The monarchism
I'm on about started after the very nasty Dark Ages and matured into
/manorial/ monarchism (MM)[fn:18] in the medieval Europe.

As viewed from thirty-thousand feet, MM was a system devised to
properly manage a relatively sparse resources balance sheet on a
continent already for many thousands of years fully occupied and
settled. That is to say, not having an entire (stolen) Continent
brimming with resources and space at their disposal, Europeans had to
be careful space- and resource-wise on their old sod... Hence, MM had
to strike an environmental balance, and it had to have teeth to
enforce this balance. MM was tight, stingy, and, when necessary,
harsh---just like the land. Simply put, MM was a perfect, organic,
natural adaptation mirroring closely the conditions, the environmental
reality at hand. Tight resources translated into tight social norms
and boundaries. Life was stratified, hierarchical, and on a
budget. Stasis, maintenance, and niche behaviors, were called for, not
growth and dynamism, not every peasant gets to go anywhere and do
anything he wanted to. For such an old place as Europe, there was no
"go West young man" after overpopulating and using up the local
resources as there was in North America.

** ...so monarchism is mainly a sort of "deep" environmentalism, right? 

Very much so. Everything monarchical was primarily rooted in the
necessity of a real and functioning environmentalism.  /For what shall
it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own
soul?/ wasn't just a nice biblical quote. And so all of modern
"progress"---our great rights and freedoms, the long list defeated
diseases and solved medical infirmities, the abundance of food in
stores and supermarkets, our magical high-tech---what does any of it
matter if we devolve into degenerates and crash the planet
environmentally? Then the whole MM scheme to limit, control, suppress
humans to not exceed the *real* limits of the land, of reality on this
planet will once again seem genial. It already does to me.

Basically, democracy has descended into the masses voting for /more/,
that is, /evermore/ prosperity, /evermore/ ease and comfort. And those
two dodgy economic systems born of the Industrial Revolution,
capitalism and socialism, vie to give the voters what they really
want. Yes, science and technology have afforded us many "more with
less" boons, but at some point this whole business of evermore people
demanding evermore resources (evermore-evermore) will have to yield to
reality.

Consider the fact that you and I are consuming upwards of one hundred
times more resources and energy per capita than our ancestors from the
year 1800 did. How can that go on? It can't. So I guess I'm not all
that concerned about everyone's rights or prosperity or ease and
comfort if we fall apart as a society or render the Earth
uninhabitable. At some point structure and stability must win over
fantasies and slobbery.

** You're not just a monarchist, but a Luddite too...

The short answer is yes. In my youth I was a great advocate of the
"Star Trek" future, a techno-Utopia as promised by classic science
fiction. But then I learned about the /Jevons Paradox/[fn:19], which
basically says we never really get more with less from each
progressive improvement in technology. It is primarily for this
diminishing returns from technology that I've been forced to give up
on any sort of modern take on environmentalism.  Again, it, like so
many other modern variations, assumes that we can save the planet if
we simply change how we're applying, deploying technology. Sorry, but
we're long past any tweaks. And no, Elon Musk and EVs will not save
us. The backlog of intractable environmental problems created by
evermore-evermore cannot be solved by the capitalist-socialist
industrialist state simply recombining itself.

And I could not avoid how modern sci-fi has taken a decidedly dark
turn into what came to be known as /cyberpunk/, typically a
near-future /dystopian/ modern-realist fiction. Everything cyberpunk
was nightmarish---mainly because futuristic technology and human
social-psychology do not play well together.

But the camel's back was broken when Mark Zuckerberg announced his big
push into virtual reality with /Meta/. We've sat through films like
/Ex Machina/ and /Her/. We've read Neal Stephenson and William
Gibson. Now we're supposed to actually step into those nightmares
waiting to happen?

** So you think we should forsake all of these science and technology advancements?

I don't see a choice. I'm not a /prepper/ or a doomsday conspiracy
theorist, but really, how can this work? At the human psychological
level, we are creating a world of "smart" devices that are not human,
that cannot truly integrate or assimilate with our unique logic and
emotion tuning. At best artificial intelligence will /simulate/
humanness---something truly creepy at best, disastrous in all
inevitability.

I don't know how much of a Christian I am, but let's say God created
us and tuned us to be this very specific balance between our logical
neocortex and our limbic system emotions. We understand this about one
another and make adjustments accordingly. But will the legions of AI
be able to truly join in with this social-psychology? No. Or if it
does, the results will be disastrous for us.

EB come back and dwell with me....


Sierra Club environmentalism is a sham, a hoax.
The heart of any sort of environmental realism

** Local trumps politics, lifestyle wars

** Stilted, flowery English?

First, I like to capitalise nouns. All nouns in German are
capitalised, and it's a practice used in Romantic poetry. and Hemingway was an idiot.

Hemingway saw Nature as a harsh testing grounds for manhood---full
stop. And so many of his protagonists wound up twisted by this
test---or at least made even more antisocial

** Where did you get all these crazy ideas?

My Grandmother, who was a Whitmore, and more English than the
Queen. She was doing the Dowager Countess Violet from /Downton Abbey/
long before Julian Fellowes even thought of trading in his Led
Zeppelin albums for Bach and Elgar. She ran her own little DA in a
small town in Southern Illinois, and spoke longingly of how more
cultured and civilised life "back East" (Zanesville, Ohio, her
parents' home town) was. She "turned us onto" the Victorian Era.

From that base I went to Germany and Switzerland, which I consider my
Hogwarts, where I was sorted into Ravenclaw, aka, the Intelligentsia.

** Aren't you avoiding reality and living in the Past?

Short answer: yes. But the Past is such a nice place.

** Somebody told me you're a racist...

I'm a very strange mixture of Left and Right on the subject of my
Race. AncestryDNA says I'm half Scottish (my mother was a Lumsden),
then a quarter English (my paternal grandmother was English) and the
rest German and Swedish, as my name, Bottorff, (or von Bottorff) is
German, an old aristocratic-patrician house that gave up titles and
wealth to follow Luther in the sixteenth century. We're not really
Swedish, but our DNA can be found in Sweden since lots of patrician
Germans fled religious persecution and resettled at the behest of the
Scandinavian Protestants in Scandinavia. Similarly, after a few
generations in Basel, Switzerland, my branch, at the behest of Queen
Anne, came to America in 1711...

...and I'm not really comfortable with that...as in this is not my
land. And no I'm not any sort of Manifest Destiny white
supremacist-racialist, either. I'm Northwestern European and very
happy with my choice of ancestry, and very protective-proud of my
Western Culture, especially as it hit its Zenith in the nineteenth
century, the so-called /Romantic Era/, also called the Victorian Era,
or as I call it the /Glorious Nineteenth/.

But having pride in being Northwest European and mad about the
Glorious Nineteenth---and not really interested in multi-cultural
mash-ups---has put me on the outs with many hard-liners. No, I don't
"celebrate diversity." Have you ever noticed how the extremely
colour-blind multiculture-multiracial advocates themselves tend to
never bring a dish to the ethnic-race potluck? They want to sit on top
of all the diversity and control it, actually. To me, every race,
creed, ethnic group needs to have a homeland, a safe place where they
don't have to know or adapt to any of the idiosyncrasies of any other
group, a place where they are completely autonomous and
self-determining. And so must we, the Northwest Europeans
be---although

** ...but aren't you just living in the past?

Oh, yes, mainly because the present is rolling down the lee side of
the Glorious Nineteenth, is the short answer. Not to mention how we're
about to forfeit everything due to mass insanity and environmental
apocalypse.

** ...but I thought you were into STEM and computers and...

Yes, I was. I've always been a searcher and philosophically tangled up
in the meaning and purpose of life. For the longest time I saw the
exponential

** Life philosophy?

Life is hard. And if we get away from its hardness and harshness for
too long, we go loopy.

* Footnotes

[fn:1] *wuthering*: adj; mainly Northern English; (of weather)
characterized by strong winds. /It's a wuthering day on the moors today./

[fn:2] This would exclude Sigurd F. Olson (1899 – 1982) an true
long-time Arrowhead bard, but who was decidedly Scandinavian
impressionistic in the spirit of Robert Frost. Boomer buy-in for
Sigurd was minimal.

[fn:3] Another set of leapers would be they who jumped from suburb
into hip, trendy urban scenes, often derided as "vapid urban
hipsters." And yet do have we here on the North Coast a "vapid /rural/
hipster" subculture?

[fn:4] Karl and Klaus attended Great Expectations grades 1 through 8.

[fn:5] According to AncestryDNA I'm Scottish, English, German, and
Swedish, although the Swedish is probably a "false positive" as my
German ancestors fled religious persecution to Protestant Sweden in
the sixteenth century.

[fn:6] The modern meaning of /goth/ is more Dark Romantic. I mean to
keep /goth/ separate from /gothic/, which is a horror/melodrama
genre---however most "experts" typically don't grasp this nuance...

[fn:7] Lots more about /sublime/ later where I wrest it away from the
clueless academes.

[fn:8] German Romanticism can be very alternate-universe eerie. We'll
eventually get to Tieck and Hoffmann, who were very
gothy-otherworldly.

[fn:9] Nature dreaming us, we dreaming Nature as two sides of the same
coin is a big theme in my upcoming novel /Emily of Wolkeld/. Much
later.

[fn:10] Baudelaire was particularly evangelical in France.

[fn:11] I'm using *academe* in the derogatory sense as a pedantic
scholar who may analyse the individual trees very well but can't see
the forest.

[fn:12] ...many of whom are actually Romanticism haters, e.g.,
modernists. Imagine reading a review of a symphony orchestra written
by a country and western fan.

[fn:13] All too often the modern academe invents, projects, imagines
something he wants to see in the bygone era, thus, we get a
revisionist /hagiography/, i.e., a subjective, facts-optional,
out-of-context account of a saint.

[fn:14] Just wait, I've got Romantic Era poetry that will blow you
away. You'll think modern lit is just some conspiracy to hide and
cover up this vastly superior work. More on this conspiracy later...

[fn:15] The Brontë sisters hardly ever left the Yorkshire village of
Haworth. Emily Brontë will be known as /Haworth/ Emily and her
sister-in-letters Emily Dickinson as /Amherst/ Emily.

[fn:16] /Emily of Wolkeld/ is about Lady Emily Whitmore, a
nineteen-year-old English earl's daughter and her German baron's
daughter friend Annette /Freiin/ von der Surwitz. They are desperately
trying to figure out their roles as peers, their /noblesse oblige/ in
modern times.

[fn:17] Actually no one is, as there was no one definite group here
Pre-Columbian. Still, most of us would say the Ojibwa were the first
peoples here.

[fn:18] Manorial in the sense that manors throughout the land were
their version of the Communist agricultural collectives.

[fn:19] In economics, the Jevons paradox (sometimes Jevons' effect)
occurs when technological progress or government policy increases the
efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount
necessary for any one use), but the rate of consumption of that
resource rises due to increasing demand.[1] The Jevons paradox is
perhaps the most widely known paradox in environmental economics.[2]
However, governments and environmentalists generally assume that
efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the
possibility of the paradox arising. (Taken from Wikipedia)
