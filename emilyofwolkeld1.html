<p class="myindent">I dread the question, How did you come up with <i>Emily of Wolkeld</i>?
simply because there is no real answer. I might say EoW simply came
out of me while in trance states, hence, I was just the scribe. But of
course that is an exaggeration. Then of course, How could you, an
68-year-old American man, possibly think you are qualified to write
about a 19-year-old English earl&rsquo;s daughter?  That&rsquo;s by far
tougher. This question contains three issues,</p>
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I&rsquo;m male,</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not English by birth,</li>
<li>and I&rsquo;m not an aristocrat.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Oh but I am forty percent English, forty percent German (the rest
Celtic/Scottish) by blood per AncestryDNA, and I might just have a
drop or two of German aristocracy in me. My namesake ancestors were
some sort of patrician family who as early adopters of Luther were on
the run from the Catholics for two centuries until Queen Anne of
Britain in 1711 took pity on us and brought us over to the
Colonies. And from my times in Europe&#x2014;Germany and Switzerland&#x2014;I
did have encounters with German aristocrats who impressed me with
their <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noblesse_oblige">noblesse oblige</a></i>. As you can imagine the whole topic of
aristocracy was completely <i>terra incognita</i> for an American, but over
the years my exposure to the Old World and its ways have fundamentally
altered me. And so a deep Old World perspective is what I&rsquo;m trying to
put forth with EoW.
</p>

<p>
Why I chose to forego traditional publishing is also a good
question. The first and foremost reason is, quite simply, the
gatekeepers of the trad publishing world won&rsquo;t let me in. The second
reason is this <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/">Edward Tufte</a> <a href="https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/">format</a> web page is so much more conducive
to this work, allowing me to place <i>sidenotes</i> exactly beside a point
in the text as needed&#x2014;and yes, they are often needed with EoW.

Emily Jane Florence Susanna Catherine Margaret Whitmore wanted to put
on a dress for the cold, sleeting Cumbrian spring morning, though it
had to be something loose and hardy, something in which a person could
work. She had been thinking of the larger-than-life portrait of her
great-great-grandmother up in cold, damp, dark Wolkeld Hall: Lady Jane
Whitmore, Countess of Wolkeld, poised and serene in her sleek silk
dress. “I am a woman, I am feminine, and that is something special in
the universe,” Emily imagined her saying. No room down here in the
lodge for all those paintings, she mused.
</p>

<p>
Yes, feminine. But capable. One of her long frock dresses might cover
the neoprene mucking boots she had brought back from America. But none
were quite that long. The modern floral-icon pattern would still be
visible. Nothing bold, nothing different, no colourful Wellingtons
this morning, she thought to herself.
</p>

<p>
She laid out a dark-olive woollen tunic dress on the bed, then her
soft Swedish woollen tights and a silk polo neck top. From under the
bed came her old hiking boots to which she began applying
waterproofing grease. Why go out in the sleet and rain? She simply
would. She was nineteen years old and knew nothing of sheep, but she
would go out all the same.
</p>

<p>
She set aside the boots and grease and went over to the
window. Embedded deep in the stone wall, the casement window offered a
view of North Hill and its ancient wood in the dim dawn light. No
green yet on the stocky oak and beech, the outline of abandoned,
derelict Wolkeld Hall just visible through the universe of black
branches.
</p>

<p>
Things crossing, things parallel. Some meandering, some moving quickly
forward. Much holding back. Here was Cumbria again, a place subtler
than America where she had lived for the past seven years. Here was
her childhood, like a dear old cat left behind, and upon returning
found stiff and slow but still alive.
</p>

<p>
To step back from the hectic modern world. To play some part
on this gloomy day in such a remote corner of the
world. “Lambs and ewes,” she whispered, smiling. To go down to
the inbye lambing pens, the tracts of various shapes and sizes
separated by ancient dry stone walls all around tiny Wolkeld
village. Or to make the long hike up to the fells, the high,
treeless slopes launching skyward beyond North Hill where ewes
were hefted or bonded to their hereditary spots on the
slopes. She sighed and a smile became a smirk. Either place
she would only be an observer—though ready to help. As would
be her father, Stanley Whitmore, the Thirteenth Earl of
Wolkeld. Despite having grown up here, he probably couldn’t
tell a ewe from a ram.
</p>

<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
</p>

<p>
The sheep and their Cumbrians, an age-old partnership, together since
the ancient Norsemen brought the hardy Herdwick breed to the high and
lonely Lake District.<label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.3277734' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.3277734' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>

</span> Wolkeld sheep farmers Thomas Sulley and Todd
Wilson carried two lifetimes of experience up to the slopes and down
to the lambing pens. And those young back-to-the-landers were quite
eager from what she had heard. And the soft-spoken veterinary couple
doing internships out of Penrith. They all spoke Northern. Polite as
they were, the flow always seemed broken whenever they had to include
her or her father. But she simply had to make a contribution. Noblesse
oblige.<label id='fnr.2' for='fnr-in.2.6293918' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.2.6293918' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>2</sup>
Noblesse oblige is nobleman&rsquo;s obligation.

</p>

<p>
Emily was twelve when her father moved the family to Manhattan,
Kansas, to take a professorship in the finance department of Kansas
State University. Stanley Whitmore: the laissez-faire capitalist, the
Thatcherite who admired America so much. Lady Catherine Whitmore,
however, saw nothing in the hot, dry Midwestern plains but an alien
land. In public Emily’s cultured mother, daughter of Baron Lucas Holde
of Sussex, played the upbeat English noblewoman, but in private she
was devastated and despondent. Their marriage already in estrangement,
the isolation drove her into a deep and at times catatonic depression.
</p>

<p>
Through it all Emily remained her mother’s daughter. In those
supposedly formative teen years she never acquired an accent, nor
seemingly anything American. A small band of nerd kids from high
school included the exotic girl in their circle; but her one true
friend was Annette von der Surwitz, an exchange student from the Harz
Mountains region of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, who had come to Manhattan
during her junior year. By amazing coincidence Annette was also a
peer. Even more amazing, her parents, Baron Freiherr Herbert and
Baroness Freifrau Sibylle von der Surwitz, had reacquired the family’s
old estate in the former East Germany after reunification and were
managing it as a modern version of an old-fashioned farming
Landgut. Emily smiled. Annette was arriving from Germany the next day
for a visit.
</p>

<p>
The sleet changed to rain and again the window became more
transparent. She could just see her breath in the grey light. Start a
fire, write a letter? No, time was wasting. Get dressed and go down to
the kitchen, she told herself. The day always began in the ancient
hall house’s rustic kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Her mother did not survive Kansas. The official cause of death was
lymphoma. Lady Catherine had refused all treatment, even pain
medication. A rush of intense, hot emotion as Emily thought of her
mother’s suffering. Her father had taken the sensitive, intelligent,
genteel woman from the things she loved and had tried to browbeat her
into accepting a place, a life she could not abide.
</p>

<p>
Sleet, and again the window was more opaque than translucent. A tear,
though in that moment a glimmer of insight: She knew her mother had
sacrificed herself to keep the family together. She now realised how
courageous she had been to simply be hurt and not turn injury into
anger and retaliation. “Brilliant, Mother, brilliant,” she whispered,
her tearing eyes wide with amazement.
</p>

<p>
Emily could hear her father shouting at her mother, calling her
useless and pathetic, badgering her to eat because she had lost so
much weight. She could see her delicate mother taking the abuse
stoically. To be cornered and abused but not strike back was somehow
courageous. She knew this with sudden certainty and clarity. Women
like her mother guided the universe with their suffering.
</p>

<p>
Finally came Andrea Kliewer, the hospice chaplain. In the final weeks
of Lady Catherine’s life, Andrea, with calm and certitude, made
progress towards reconciling husband, wife, and daughter into a family
again. And after Lady Catherine’s death, she remained an integral part
of their lives. She and Emily met weekly for grief counselling, later
including Lord Stanley as well.
</p>

<p>
Though the repentant Stanley Whitmore was too late for reconciliation
with his father. Lord Henry Whitmore, Twelfth Earl of Wolkeld, had
died just a fortnight before his daughter-in-law.
</p>

<p>
The new earl seemed desperate to make up all the wayward years of
strife and alienation overnight. He pestered Sulley and Wilson,
pumping them for information, trying to stamp a role for himself out
of his ancestral ground. His daughter likewise wanted something to do,
some role to play. Noblesse oblige, indeed.
</p>

<p>
Emily envied Annette. Her Freiin led the life of a young German
noblewoman, dutifully following her father and mother to formal
events, then pivoting to play the farmer’s daughter—working in the
fields and gardens, running their raw milk dairy operation. But they
were Germans, and Germans always seemed so logical.
</p>

<p>
Sleet to rain again, crystalline to fluid. Emily felt the cold and
slipped into her Icelandic zip-up. What was out there? Cumbria was out
there. A Cumbrian spring was typically wet and chill. Spring in
Kansas, however, had been a warning of the intolerably hot summer to
come. Emily hated the Kansas summers most of all. Too strange it was
to escape the sweltering heat into artificially cooled spaces. For
countless aeons her people had done just the opposite—escaped cold
into heated spaces.
</p>

<p>
College? She had been a straight-A student at her Kansas high school
and had done quite well on her SAT exam, but no, just be here for a
time, just stay low and quiet for a while, allow the coolness of
spring to pass and the inevitable warmth of summer to grow. Through
all the newness, strangeness, and uncertainty, something of the land
reached out and told her to simply watch and experience.
</p>

<p>
Her father was the new earl, but his mother, her grandmother, Lady
Susanna Whitmore, still retained control of much of the
properties. Unusual, done as Emily understood to keep the full
inheritance tax from coming due all at once. Stanley wanted to take an
active role, but Gran seemed to have a tin ear for most of his
ideas. She was wary of the son who had stormed off to America after
being so fiercely, so bitingly critical of his parents. Emily knew he
had called their lives as farming gentry a sham and a farce.
</p>

<p>
The fact that small-scale sheep herding was not really competitive—or
at least only for niche markets—hung over the valley like a
curse. That Cumbrian farmers were dependent upon government subsidies,
only kept up as many said for the tourists. Modern large-scale,
large-holdings agriculture supplying the global commodities markets
had long since overshadowed traditional English manorial
system. Beyond a doubt the region’s main industry was
tourism. Nevertheless, Stanley Whitmore had some vision of gentleman
farming in his head and very much wanted to run with it.
</p>

<p>
Lord Stanley with eight middle names had returned home a believer in
local, traditional farming, as well as other-century manorial
monarchism in general. And he would bend any ear with how genial the
whole thing had been all along—simply put, the best long-term
management strategy for the limited resources of their chilly, rainy
British Isles. But what about market-rewarded innovation and
efficiency; what about global trade and economies of scale; what about
the seemingly ceaseless science and technology revolution? When any
astonished (bemused?) friend asked him what had happened to his
pro-business Thatcherite conservatism, he would energetically explain
his new and surely more true conservativism. He who once stood so
firmly for free-market globalist dynamism had reinvented himself as a
fundamentalist High Tory Luddite monarchist.
</p>

<p>
Emily listened closely to the rain on the window. Behind the delicate
patter was silence, the old sort. Not just the chance absence of
sound, narrowly localised in a normally noisy world; rather, a deep,
dominant, timeless creature stretching for miles in all
directions. She stood absolutely still and quiet in the dim light
afforded by the two-foot-diagonal window. She breathed in deeply, took
a step back, swept her gaze across the rough, uneven, lime plaster
walls—then exhaled slow and deliberate.
</p>

<p>
Compared to their suburban Kansas Neo-eclectic “McMansion,” put up in
a few weeks from tree-farm pine, Chinese plasterboard, and vinyl
siding, their stone and timber-frame hall house, supposedly started
during the reign of Edward VI, seemed the mass of a small planet. She
felt completely at peace in this old place, an entirely new feeling
after so many sad and stressful years. She drifted over to the old
wooden table that served as her desk. Among the books and papers was
her pocket edition of Emily Brontë’s poetry. She picked it up and, as
she often did of a morn, read Stars.

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Ah! why, because the dazzling sun<br>
Restored our earth to joy<br>
Have you departed, every one,<br>
And left a desert sky?<br>
<br>
All through the night, your glorious eyes<br>
Were gazing down in mine,<br>
And with a full heart; thankful sighs<br>
I blessed that watch divine!<br>
<br>
I was at peace, and drank your beams<br>
As they were life to me<br>
And revelled in my changeful dreams<br>
Like petrel on the sea.<br>
<br>
Thought followed thought, star followed star<br>
Through boundless regions on,<br>
While one sweet influence, near and far,<br>
Thrilled through and proved us one.<br>
<br>
Why did the morning dawn to break<br>
So great, so pure a spell,<br>
And scorch with fire the tranquil cheek<br>
Where your cool radiance fell?<br>
<br>
Blood-red he rose, and arrow-straight<br>
His fierce beams struck my brow:<br>
The soul of Nature sprang elate,<br>
But mine sank sad and low!<br>
<br>
My lids closed down, yet through their veil<br>
I saw him blazing still;<br>
And steep in gold the misty dale<br>
And flash upon the hill.<br>
<br>
I turned me to the pillow then<br>
To call back Night, and see<br>
Your worlds of solemn light, again<br>
Throb with my heart and me!<br>
<br>
It would not do the pillow glowed<br>
And glowed both roof and floor,<br>
And birds sang loudly in the wood,<br>
And fresh winds shook the door.<br>
<br>
The curtains waved, the wakened flies<br>
Were murmuring round my room,<br>
Imprisoned there, till I should rise<br>
And give them leave to roam.<br>
<br>
O Stars and Dreams and Gentle Night;<br>
O Night and Stars return!<br>
And hide me from the hostile light<br>
That does not warm, but burn<br>
<br>
That drains the blood of suffering men;<br>
Drinks tears, instead of dew:<br>
Let me sleep through his blinding reign,<br>
And only wake with you!<br>
